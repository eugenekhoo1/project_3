2022-11-24 08:32:38,Anxiety,"The pandemic gave me chronic stress, which as a result gave me anxiety, and the main external stressor (financial) hasn't gone anywhere so the anxiety has really been kicking in over the past 6 months or so. I've developed all kinds of odd physical symptoms, that I never would have put down to anxiety except I've been checked out medically and there's 'nothing wrong'. 

I've always been someone who loves learning. Understanding why something is really helps me not stress about it. So I was wondering if anyone could recommend any good sources of information on why anxiety affects the body. All I know is that is affects our body chemistry, but which chemistry, and why does that result in physical symptoms?

I'm particularly interested in understanding why I feel tense when I try to go to sleep, internal tremors, lightheadedness and dizziness, heart palpitations and 'skipped beats' with the hard to describe ""wave"" feeling that goes with it. And why do I get these sensations when I'm not consciously stressed or anxious about anything.

I don't know how much knowledge there is out there on this (I suspect we might know really know how it all works) but my family doctor just kind of shrugged. When I was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism (Graves) a few years ago I educated myself and ended up knowing more than my doctor and got myself to remission - I laugh when every other medical professional I speak to immediately asks if I had my thyroid removed... no, you don't tend to need that if you follow the current science! Anyway, I'm curious what the current science is. Are there any good books / Youtube videos / Ted talks / research papers out there? Whenever I google I tend to find websites telling me I should just do yoga and try to relax. I'm not looking for how to fix it with this, I'm trying to understand it better so I worry about it less.

Thanks in advance :-)",Why does anxiety cause the physical symptoms it does?

[https://lassebomh.github.io/box-breathing/](https://lassebomh.github.io/box-breathing/)

It will be free and open source forever and contains no ads or distractions. You can also save the website to your desktop/homescreen for fast and offline use. Instructions are at the bottom of the page.

Just remember:

* Breathe using your diaphragm (stomach)
* Breathe in through your nose, and out through your mouth.
* Beginners might sometimes feel out of breath. This is normal and not a problem. Allow yourself inhale/exhale a little too early/late if you feel the need.
* I'd recommend using a different breathing technique during an anxiety attack, but it could definitely be useful in the onset.

And so I’m really anxious about going because I feel like there’s just one more reason to be judged. I feel like I’m broken because I can’t even go and sit through a couple of dinners with my family without breaking down. 

And as I think about I’ve realized how bad I’ve been since I had my panic attack (multiple actually). I had to find a new job because of my anxiety, and set up some job interviews. But I got too anxious and couldn’t go to them (I’ve been getting by doing doordash and stuff like that). I shut out all my friends and the people closest to me after my panic attacks, and just didn’t talk to them. I can’t even talk to a therapist. I’m too anxious and embarrassed to talk to a therapist.

I started showing many phobias at the age of 3, in my childhood my muscles were always very stiff, I had headaches, stomaches, overly worried about stuff like dogs, missing the bus, swimming, riding an elevator, etc...

My education was also greatly affected by anxiety due to the insomina I had before tests and exams and instead of getting 16s or 17s out of 20, I would be in the 11s and 12s even though I had studied everything. I did not get into the military because I had the worst night of my life before the physical exams... one year of hard work went to waste, not really because I became fit but still, it is disapointing to see all of your hard work go to waste because of your anxiety.

I can't sleep at night, only with Rivotril, I take Escilatopram, an antidepressant and I still feel like shit, the only things that make me happy is exercise and being with my family and friends, I absolutely hate university and I haven't gone to classes in months because of my social phobia. 

I have used drugs such as LSD, tobacco and alcohol to cope with the physical pain anxiety brings you and it is working but I'm not happy. I have friends, a loving family but I can't be happy even with antidepressants.

I was with friends despite my strong anxiety and a few days ago and then my nose got dry and stuffy and I panicked. Thinking I made everyone sick. 
I’m not sick it went away. I felt well but my brain wants to trick me like what if you still made them sick even though you are perfectly well? I don’t think my friends are sick but I haven’t heard from them. 

And my mom is sick and she is not taking it seriously and potentially infecting my dad and it makes me so anxious to talk to her. I should be worried and caring for her but instead I am angry at her and anxious and I hate myself for it. And I was with her last week so naturally I’m hyper focused on every little body sensation to see if I am also sick even though I know deep down that I am well.

2022-11-24 02:46:22,Anxiety,"Warning: This is a long post.

&amp;#x200B;

This is something about myself I've only come to realize recently, and it sounds incredibly sad, but being happy triggers my anxiety.

Yes, being happy... triggers my anxiety.

For a bit of context, I'm not happy when I'm sad (obviously), and when I'm sad I actively try to be happy, but it feels comfortable. When I'm sad, I know that there's no lower I can go than that. I know that no matter how fucked up my life, or a situation gets, I will always be just as depressed/sad, but when I'm happy, my anxiety is active.

Being happy for me is never something that's lasted for a long time, especially recently.

I have very isolated moments where I'm happy, followed by long periods of time where I'm not. Naturally, your body and mind crave happiness, but being happy, to my brain, is unreliable. I am actively aware that when I'm happy, it's only a matter of time before I'm not happy again. This is bad because if I find something that makes me happy, or in this case a person... I try so hard to keep them with me at all times that I end up ruining our relationship/friendship.

I thought for so long that there was just something wrong with my personality, maybe I'm just overly clingy, or something.

But I noticed that being around the people that makes me happy is so anxiety-inducing to me that I had a dream JUST LAST NIGHT about them not being my friend anymore.

They are very aware that I'm afraid of this, and reassure me that they won't stop being my friend, which is really nice, and I appreciate it a lot from them, but it isn't enough for me to stop worrying.

I've had many friends, or even romantic partners that say that exact same thing, just weeks, or even days before they cut off contact forever.

So basically, whenever I'm happy, it almost (or does) get ruined because my brain keeps reminding me ""It's only a matter of time"". It gets to the point to where when I'm happy, I think *EVERY* little bump in the road is the end.

Even with the slightest indication that things aren't going well, my brain tells me that it's *all* over.

&amp;#x200B;

The issue is... being happy is something that's proven to be so unreliable to me in the past, that I know I'll just end up going back to being sad again. Reliability is something I need in my life, and unfortunately, being sad is somehow more reliable to me than being happy.

This might sound crazy, and I agree, it is, but it's how I think. This year, I spent the past 9 months with absolutely no one to talk to. I spoke to very few people, and even when I did, it was at varying levels each time it happened. I'm suddenly into a situation where I'm speaking to more people than ever, and I'm really happy, because I realized that being alone was hurting me, but now that I've realized how bad being alone was for me, I'm struggling so hard to avoid it, and that can't work forever. 

When I am alone, I am the most unhappy I've been in a long time, due to the fact that when I'm happy, I'm the happiest I've been in YEARS. It's like if ""Happiness"" is one end of the spectrum, and ""Sadness"" is the other, when I get yanked to one side, I know it's only a matter of time before the velocity goes neutral, and I'm sent catapulted to the other side.

&amp;#x200B;

I know this is a long post, and I'm very sorry. I need someone to vent to about this right now and I don't have anyone I'd be comfortable venting to, so here this is. Does what I say make sense? I hope I explained the way I've been feeling well. It's something I'm struggling with a lot right now, and only just recently realized that I feel this way.",Anxiety Ruins Everything

2022-11-24 01:39:37,Anxiety,"I've had anxiety in some form my entire life. More recently it's basically been diagnosed as GAD because I've always got a low level of background anxiety and it often impacts my decision making.

Anyways... Three nights ago my heart started skipping beats. I think we're all allowed a few heart skips every once in a while, but this was every 5-15 seconds for THREE HOURS.

I had to take some Ativan to fall asleep, and the next day I felt pretty normal. I saw my doctor for an EKG (normal) and blood work (still waiting on results). I didn't have any chest pain, dizziness, fatigue, shortness of breath, or stroke symptoms. 

Then it happened again that night. Then again for a while at 7am. Then again some more at 3pm. Then again at 10pm last night. Then again at 6am this morning.

Each time I've taken a small dose of Ativan to try and get it to stop and it seems to help. I'm just not sure why this is suddenly happening for the first time in my life.

I'll be in touch with my doctor again today and I'm sure he'll set me up to see a cardiologist. I'll probably have to wear a heart monitor for a week or something and do a stress test.

This is very strange for me because my health is in very good condition since I've started biking/mountain biking multiple times a week and I'm only 5'9 142 lbs (male).

2022-11-24 00:41:37,Anxiety,"Hi all, I’ve been dealing with anxiety for most of my life - I’m 31F. My anxiety presents as a fear of panic attacks (and of people seeing me panic). I know my body is capable of escalating quickly to panicking once I start to worry, so I fear situations that trigger that panic, especially situations where people might be able to see that I am really anxious. It happens in self-sabotaging ways where it’s important to me to stay calm; those are the times that I feel anxiety really peaking. And there’s an anticipation factor too; the more time I have to sit and think about how anxious I am, the worse it gets. So my main triggers are work interviews, work presentations, standing up in a wedding, having blood drawn. 

I feel that I’ve really assessed my triggers, my thought patterns, and the reasoning behind why my anxiety comes up. I do guided meditations regularly. I have read books (one being “When Things Fall Apart” by Pema Chodron) that have given me ideas of how I want to approach my anxiety and life as a whole. I just can’t quite get to the point where I can take action on my ideas and improve my anxiety. 

I recently tried therapy again. But it’s been so frustrating because it’s not helpful at all. The therapist can empathize with how I feel but not provide any helpful steps or solutions that I haven’t already done. I see no benefit in sticking it out to see if the sessions become more helpful in the future. I feel like I need someone to help me break out of my thought patterns and beliefs about my anxiety - I haven’t found a therapist who can help me with that. 

Are there therapists that fully stick to mindfulness/meditation/eastern medicine techniques and how do I find them? Or is there some other option outside of therapy that would be helpful? Or do I just need to find a better traditional therapist? Any help is so appreciated.",Alternatives to Traditional Therapy?

Still, I still go through phases and despite having a endless number of tools to handle my lows/crisis I sometimes still get very frustrated at myself for everything that I go through.

I’ve had anxiety for the past decade, and I’ve been able to manage certain aspects of it a lot better than I ever have. I felt like I was on a upward trajectory, but suddenly, I developed a severe anxiety of being in my house at night, particularly when I’m going to sleep. Now, I’ve always been anxious about being home alone at night. However, it never had this fear when I was living with others. Currently, I live with my boyfriend and I feel very safe with him…until it’s time to turn of the lights and go to bed. 

He’s very understanding of my anxiety and knows how to adapt to when I develop new phobias. But I feel awful with how disruptive this is getting. I’m constantly double checking the locks, locking out bedroom door, putting something in front of our bedroom door, and I started looking at different security bars that I can place on our bedroom door handle. Hell, I haven’t been able to go to the restroom by myself in the middle of the night for the past week. 

This started after my last roommate moved out two months ago (ended on a bad note), and I stayed in the apartment and renewed the lease. I started getting paranoid that she knew where I lived still, and my landlord didn’t change the locks for a week. Then it’s gotten worse in the past month after several high profile murders in my city and my country. Every night I’m scared about breaking in and I lay awake trying to listen for noises. I do live in a notoriously dangerous city in a neighborhood that has crime issues.

2022-11-23 13:29:22,Anxiety,"So I (24M) have taken psychedelics about 10 times in my life. Out of those 10, 2 were bad experiences that seemed to stick with me for quite some time. The first time was when I think I was 16. Took too much acid. In the months that followed, I had a spike in my anxiety and OCD which caused me to develop symptoms of DPDR. I saw a therapist about it, and eventually felt better. Still had mild anxiety in my daily life, but the DPDR stopped completely, which was amazing to feel such clarity. 

Fast forward to this summer, im hippie flipping every now and again with some buddies (for those of you who don’t know, this is taking mushrooms and molly together). I did it 3 times in total, with the third being by myself. I was getting ready to move out of my parents house the next day, and still had some left over, so I figured id take it (I know, terrible idea). I ended up tripping way harder than I thought I would, and had a full blown panic attack during the experience. Like this may have been the most anxious I had been in years. Luckily, my best friend was only a phone call away and he calmed me down completely. 

In the months after this negative experience, my anxiety has gone up significantly again. Ive had episodes of DPDR and have a panic attack almost daily, where I just cant stop the intrusive thoughts from spilling in. This has been exasperated by the fact that I am visiting my parents for Thanksgiving and am staying in the same house that the bad trip took place. I think when I am at my apartment I am able to manage it more. 

Sorry for venting, this is the first time ive really talked about it all since it happened (and now im telling all of Reddit! Haha). Im really just curious if anybody has had a similar experience, and if so, what did you do that helped?

I've smoked weed a bunch of times with no negative side effects but a handful of times I've had sever panic episodes that for hours and they're all centered on the idea that I'm in some form of hell, or damned, and that when I die, that's when the really bad stuff is going to happen.

Yesterday I tried to get this full spectrum CBD oil (extra strength) and I couldn't get much out of the bottle with my dropper so I tried pouring some into my tea but a bunch came out, so I drank it. I've been informed that if you eat the oil a lot of the CBD gets filtered out by your liver but not the TCH. So I had a full-on attack that lasted 6+ hours and I'm still on edge and having extremely intrusive thoughts today. Basically the gist of the voice in my head (that is supposedly God the Father?) was insulting me and how lukewarm I am (my name is Luke and there's that spat you out of my mouth verse) and my shortcomings. But also claiming that I'm Satan and I'm being punished by being reincarnated over and over and that this entire universe is a simulation just for me and no one is real. And it said that any evidence or logic to disprove this theory was just a purposeful obfuscation of the truth (that I'm Satan and damned). So it said to ""Go ahead and get therapy and do research. Your hope is delicious."" It said that I needed to convert my girlfriend, who it labeled as God, to Christianity... even though she kind of already believes in it, though doesn't really go to church. It also said that the Bible in my universe was purposefully flawed so that I wouldn't believe it. And the voice said I'd progressively get crazier and the next time we'd speak was when I'm 70.

Anyway... I know this sounds really insane, but it's just sticking in my brain because it's like a self-proving conspiracy theory and any evidence that contradicts it is actually evidence for it. I'm a pretty high-strung individual as it is, but this fear is just more than I can bare. My logical brain tells me that it's just the weed talking... but these few brushes I've had with an entity claiming to be a vengeful god are the worst experiences I've had in my life and I don't want them to become permeant mental scars.

2022-11-23 11:30:52,Anxiety,"Hey all,

Hoping I can maybe get some calming reassurance.

I've been getting these head rushes recently. I'm pretty convinced that they're due to anxiety, as 99% of the time I get them when I am alone with my thoughts, and hardly ever get them around others when I am distracted, unless I am particularly stressed or anxious at that time as well. They don't seem to happen when I'm in the throes of anxiety, just more so relaxing and doing menial leusire stuff.

The feeling is very hard to describe. It's not painful whatsoever, but I'm not quite sure what it feels like. Not vibration, not a shock/zap, not heat or cold. It just feels like a wave of *something* that swells up in my head and is gone all within the span of 1 single second. The closest I can think of is those ear rumbles that some people can do on command, but in the form of a feeling in my brain, and for a very short amount of time. Every time it happens, my mind rushes to ""You're having a stroke/you're about to pass out"". Never had either, but those are what my mind imagines those might feel like the split second they start, I guess. Obviously adrenaline and panic follows because it's a startling thing to happen, but since they've happens a good dozen or so times at this point, the first rush of anxiety fades somewhat quickly.

Does anyone experience something similar? Anything you've done to help them stop/ease your mind about it, or know what the cause is?

2022-11-23 11:14:15,Anxiety,"I haven't lurked in this sub for that long so apologies if this topic has already been discussed but let me get right to the point.

I personally no longer believe that most anxiety disorders are caused by chemical imbalances (in the traditional theory we're used to) or by psychology. I went through a long period of believing I had a simple chemical imbalance and that this was  real medical issue. Then I got fed up with the medical establishment and went in the other direction, believing it was all psychological and rooted in childhood trauma and negative beliefs and thoughts etc. But years of talk therapy and CBT didn't help either.

After having dysautonomia, then covid, post-viral syndrome and feelings that are so disturbing I want to kill myself almost every day I now believe the medical field is extremely behind and also lazy in regards to these 'mood' disorders. 

The chemical imbalance theory is in tatters and psychiatrists are silently sweeping it under the rug. The idea of how SSRIs work went from 'this is a serotonin (or whatever) imbalance that the pills help correct' to 'these pills encourage new neuronal growth and that's how they work'. In fact, I always suspected blaming mood problems on one or two brain chemicals was suspiciously simplistic. 

What I believe the future of mental health research should be and where we will find answers is neurology. I believe these disorders are real medical conditions but not the oversimplified too much/too little serotonin/adrenaline/acetylcholine. 

The fact is, anxiety and depression are a SYMPTOM of many known diseases such as diabetes, hyper and hypo thyroidism, syphilis, autoimmune disorder, hormonal disorders, viral, bacterial and parasitic infection to name just a few. This is not just some 'thinking out loud'. These are facts and you can find study after study and article after article showing that physical diseases cause anxiety and depression as part of the disease.

Right now, the only options we get, if we're lucky enough to get any, are either talk therapy or SSRIs (benzos if you're VERY lucky). And from what I've seen here, neither of these work that well for a large amount of people. This is simply not good enough. 

I believe this is due in part to the popularity of CBT and this idea that your thoughts and feelings create your emotions that has become really embedded in our society. While this is true to some extent, it is completely unhelpful.

It has been shown time and time again that inflammation in the brain (which could be part of a wide variety of known diseases) creates all sorts of strange and sometimes debilitating psychiatric symptoms. I cannot make the inflammation and viral activity in my brain stop by thinking positive thoughts or deep breathing. Can you?

I believe these two common approaches, talking and SSRIs, fail for so many people because these two things just don't fix the underlying disease causing the issue. I think in the future, this will be well researched and accepted. This always seems to be the way of medicine. An idea is scoffed at and derided and then slowly gains acceptance. I mean look at SSRI withdrawal syndrome. Health professionals swore up and down that it's not a thing, it doesn't exist, that withdrawal is short and mild etc but now more and more accept that it's often debilitating for people (though not as many doctors as I would like!). 

Just because our technology and testing techniques aren't advanced enough yet to discover the exact mechanism, the exact pathways, doesn't mean it's impossible. I mean, until five or so years ago the medical profession firmly believed that the brain was immuno-priveleged until some researchers discovered lymphatic system in the brain. 

It is disgusting to me that people like me, people with dysautonomia, people that have been affected by viruses are sent off to therapy and pressured to take SSRIs when neither of these alters or helps the physical processes causing the mental suffering I face every day. 

Yes, some anxiety disorders start through identifiable trauma, yes SSRIs help some people. Yes, deep breathing and changing your thinking works in situation anxiety. But I really do think, for those of us with severe issues, it is seriously neurological, not psychological, not a simplistic 'chemical imbalance' but a neurological issue related to disease process and immunity and we should stop believing that talking and psych drugs are the only viable solutions and we should especially stop feeling ashamed and guilty when neither of these things improve our symptoms, because I know I do that!",Not psychological and not a chemical imbalance

2022-11-23 10:56:06,Anxiety,"Long story short, I've been taking Lexapro for about 5 weeks, only 5 mg in the morning because the last time I took it was about a year ago at night and I hated it. Well I took a 10mg last Monday in the morning for the first time because it is obviously the natural progression to increase my dosage. I didn't have any side affects really in the first four weeks on 5mg in the morning. Last Monday night, after taking the 10mg in the morning, I woke up incredibly dizzy.

I used to love going out, my days would be like mini adventures, meeting up with different friends across the city, going to different bars. I hated staying home. I loved road trips, flying, new experiences, I loved to meeting people. 

Now? The idea of leaving my house for any reason causes me physical anxiety. I get anxiety before hanging out with my friends that I’ve known for years and who are good people, it’s like some thing is happening in my body and I cannot shake this agoraphobia, and this fear like I am about to die.

I hate it so much, I don’t know what happened. I have trauma but why is it just now kicking in so hard, especially after years of therapy. Was it Covid? what happened to me? 

It feels like my anxiety is going to kill me. Sometimes my heart starts racing even if I think I’m feeling ok…

2022-11-23 10:33:54,Anxiety,"So this is a long story but here goes. I never realized I struggled with anxiety until it started to really affect my mind while I had to work or really anything I needed to do. When I say anxiety I mean full blown stomach cramps, feeling sweaty, feeling cold, and feeling that moment of panic. The other day I had an anxiety attack for the first time that I felt like I couldn’t even catch my breath. The whole thing that triggered it was a text from a guy friend or a FWB. He basically told me that he was sleeping with other people and that if I couldn’t handle that then maybe we shouldn’t talk anymore. The thing that bothered me was I’ve known him for years and considered him a good friend of mine. I guess to see that he was willing to just throw it all away was hard to deal with. Now I am overthinking every single thing he has ever told me and I’m dwelling on who this other person is and all these thoughts of “is it serious “ keep running through my head. I just need some advice on how to maybe cope better. I need to take small steps because he means a lot to me and I have expressed that to him but all he said was he did care but he did not see it turning into anything. I am considering going to the doctor or for medication to cope with anxiety.",Am I overthinking?
2022-11-23 10:29:34,Anxiety,"So, some background.  October 13th, 2022 my eldest brother passed away from a heart attack, at the young age of 50, just over a month shy of his 51st birthday.  He was in great health, much better than myself.  He was very active, didn't smoke, ate well, etc.  My mom's side of the family has a history of heart problems.  My grandfather died of a heart attack at 42, and my uncle passed away at 60 from a heart attack as well.

I've never been one to cry when grieving.  I've lost several relatives as people my age will, I'm 45, turning 46 in December.  And all through my life I've been a pet owner and there's a long list of animals that have been lost.  I've never had any problems with dealing with death before, but I will admit that my brother is the first close relation that I've lost.

But, as I said, I'm not one to cry.  Since my brother's death I've shed a few tears, mostly when I listen to his favourite musical artists, or music that I like because he introduced me to it.  The tears have been few and far between, and there has been no intense outpouring of emotion that one might expect when losing someone so close to them.

Unfortunately my grief has manifested itself in the form of panic/anxiety attacks.  There were 2 or 3 occasions when I literally thought I was going to have a heart attack myself.  I ended up in an ambulance and then at the hospital.  Every test they ran on me came back indicating I was in good health.  Chest XRay, several ECG's.  I also have been to see a cardiologist and all the tests they put me through there also indicate my health is fine.  Ultrasounds, stress test, blood work, even wore a heart rate monitor for 3 days and it caught a few episodes, but the Dr. said that while my heart rate definitely sky rockets at times, it is beating very fast, but normal.  There is no irregular heart beat rhythm.

The attacks seem to be random, and as all my tests are reassuring that I'm in good health (relatively), the attacks are way more manageable.   I was off work for 2 weeks, but have since returned.  I still have episodes, even while working, but am able to get myself through them with simple concentrated breathing and some inner dialogue.

What I am now experiencing is that I don't notice my heart rate jumping as much, even though my smart watch tells me it has, in fact, gone way up.  So it seems my brain is starting to ignore these episodes.  Sometimes when I look at my watch to check the time I'll see that the last measured heart rate was anywhere up to 140 bpm, and that's basically a rating heart rate, not under any stress due to heavy activity.  I think the highest it ever measured was 160 bpm resting... most episodes now seem to top out at 120 to 130 bpm.  Again, this is all while in a resting state.

My question is, has anyone else gone through something like this, and is the fact that my brain doesn't seem to feel any anxiety or panic during an episode seem to be a good thing?  A lot of the time, as I mentioned I only notice an elevated heart rate after the fact when I'm checking the time on my watch.  There are some times that I definitely feel the anxiety but I force myself not to check my heart rate because for a while I was checking obsessively which really only made things worse.  

I'm hoping to get some feed back from someone who has experienced something similar, whether or not the attacks sort of ran their course and just passed with time.  I have been speaking with a psychiatric nurse and psychologist that the hospital put me in touch with, though I've only had one meeting with them so far, and it felt like they were mostly gathering a lot of background info.

I am hoping that since my body isn't triggering my brain to go into flight or fight mode nearly as much, regardless of what my body may be doing that this is a good sign and things will shortly pass.  It hasn't been easy, but when I started to feel uncomfortable in public places with crowds, I knew I had to get back to work before things went too far and I became a shut in.",Anxiety/Panic Attacks

2022-11-23 09:54:32,Anxiety,"I found out recently that my uncle has booked a trip for the two of us to go to Asia for three weeks this summer. It may sound ridiculous that I don't want to go, since he's already paid for it and it's a place I've always wanted to go to. But when he told me over the phone, I started having a panic attack. I managed to play it off as excitement and I think I convinced my Dad and Uncle I was happy. But in reality, I spent the next 48 hours in a state of panic and shock. I wasn't able to eat, I was sweating and overheated, trembling and running to the bathroom because my stomach was in knots. I couldn't really sleep without feeling another panic attack coming on, so I kept counting backwards from 100 to keep my mind calm. I even prayed for something to happen so I wouldn't have to go. 

Its horrible that this supposed piece of good news made me react this way, but I really couldn't help my reaction. It made me finally admit that I have an anxiety disorder of some kind, because this type of behaviour is not uncommon for me. I've made the first step in getting help, I have an appointment with a doctor next week who will hopefully refer me to therapy. 

But the matter remains that I don't want to go, I feel awful saying it but I wish he had consulted me before he booked it. I feel like I've been boxed into a corner and that I'm going to be the ultimate bad guy for saying no because he genuinely thought he was making my dreams come true. It's not like I don't want to go to Asia some day, but I'd rather have done it on my own terms, with people I felt more comfortable travelling with. My uncle planning it without saying anything to me, when it would never have even crossed my mind he would do this, just aggravates my anxiety more. I don't feel like I have any control or say in this situation. It doesn't help that some of the family already knows he's booked it, so it's not just his reaction I have to worry about, it's theirs as well. And I do worry telling him would ruin our relationship forever.

The only person that knows what I'm going through is my mother, she was able to guess within 24 hours of the news something was wrong. She told me I was acting like I've been shot. And to be fair I do think I was in some kind of shock, I've had panic attacks before but I've never felt like that in my life. It's like I'd achieved a higher level of panic I'd never experienced. I think my mother was annoyed with me too, but after a few days I think she's realised this trip is a bad idea if I'm acting like this. She made the point that if I don't want to go now is the time to say. 

There's a part of me that wants to leave it for a while and not saying anything and hope I change my mind, that I get better but the longer I leave it and I still don't want to go, the worse it's going to get. He might not be able to get his money back or find someone else to go with him if I leave it too long. Plus more family will find out as time goes on as well which makes it worse. I just don't want to say I'm okay with it, only at the last minute to say I'm not and refuse to go, wasting his money and angering him in the process. Or go and spend all that time away counting the days until I go home. I don't think I could put on a brave face for that long, I'll crack at one point and I don't want to ruin the experience for him either. Because this is a trip he wants to go on too, it wasn't just for me that he booked it.

I don't know I just really just wish he'd asked before he booked it, because now I'm in a situation I never wanted to be in. 

TLDR: Uncle surprised me with a trip to Asia, I spent the next 48 hours suffering from panic attacks which made me accept I have anxiety. I'm getting help, but now I'm faced with the problem of telling my uncle I don't want to go and facing the backlash.",I've been surprised with the trip of a lifetime but I don't want to go

2022-11-23 09:40:35,Anxiety,"Hello! 

In the spring I started developing anxiety and panic attacks after as especially vicious seizure (I have epilepsy) one morning. After that I became scared of going to sleep as I used to have most of my seizures ""upon waking"". I don't know why I didn't have this fear in the 20 years of having seizures before but for some reason it set something off.

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't had a major seizure since, but I still can't sleep. I will lay in bed until I absolutely cannot be awake anymore. This leads to some nights where I don't sleep at all and then the next day sleep 15+ hours or lay in bed till 4 am, have a panic attack and then pass out. I am thankfully off work but I need to return soon and need to have this under control.

&amp;#x200B;

Last month my GP suggested it might be time to look at medication, even though I am already on multiple for my epilepsy so I am hesitant to add more. I am already in therapy which helps during the day, but not 3 am me. She gave me the choice between Lexapro and Seroquel which I would go on for 6 months or so to try and ""break the cycle"", but I don't know which one to pick. Do either of them make you sleepy as well as help with the anxiety?

If it's relevant, I am also on Briveracetam, Lamictal, and Ativan as needed for seizures.

2022-11-23 09:37:19,Anxiety,"Hi everyone, just wanted to hear some thoughts on something that happened while I was on a trip with a close friend. 

The first few days of the trip were going well, until the second last day when I got a message from my friend’s partner to call him and that it was urgent. I didn’t meet him prior to this and he found my Facebook account. I later found out that he found my Instagram account and messaged/tried called me there too. My friend’s phone had run out of battery and he wasn’t able to contact my friend and hence tried to contact me. 

I decided to call in case it was really something urgent but when my friend picked up they seemed to be talking normally and I was a little annoyed. They ended the call as the connection was bad and we walked out of the place we were at. My friend then asked to use my phone again to call her partner and I was really frustrated at this point. What’s worse is that she left me sitting by myself without my phone for 15 minutes to talk to her partner.. I was really angry but decided to hear her out because I didn’t know what was going on. 

Turns out her partner was paranoid that she was cheating on them as he has trust issues and had bad experiences in a relationship before. She had mentioned a guy she used to date suggesting some places we could check out and he immediately assumed that she was going to meet him. It raised some flags in my head as she said that he didn’t trust her and she tries her best to update him wherever we go. The fact that he tried to call me to talk to her and ended up talking to her for 15 minutes while we were on a trip and spending time together also doesn’t sit right with me… I understand how debilitating anxiety can be and so I told my friend how I felt honestly and told her that I don’t have any hard feelings for what happened, but I hoped that we would be able to spend time together without this happening again. 

Fast forward to the next day we were having an amazing time and had really great conversations. I was really happy as what happened yesterday felt like the first hurdle in our friendship. But…. While we were chilling at a cafe she got a call from her partner again and I rolled my eyes half-jokingly at her. She picked up and asked me if she could go outside to talk to him and I said sure but don’t take too long. She ended up coming back only 30 minutes later and I was really frustrated at that point and a little embarrassed that I was sitting at the cafe all alone without my friend. I struggle with social anxiety too so that was a little hard. 

When she came back she looked really apprehensive and told me that the guy had flew over just to surprise her and see her as he misses her.. I was really shocked and felt a little upset as this was supposed to be our trip together. she knows that I am not comfortable with meeting new people especially at such short notice so I think she was trying to tell him that he can’t come and join us. I think he felt really suspicious of her (she told me he thinks that she’s trying to separate us and not let us meet) and I could sense that she was really overwhelmed as well. She tried to tell him that I had social anxiety and wasn’t ready to meet but he didn’t seem to believe her as I was quite friendly for a few seconds while he was on a video call with her previously lol. Sounded almost like he was trying to insist I was an extrovert the way my friend was telling me. I was really frustrated and I told her that it was not ok that he just flew over and decide to join us without even telling us first and that she could go spend time with him if she wants and I’ll find something else to do as I could tell that she really didn’t know what to do. 

There’s more that happened after like him booking a room in the same place we were staying at (I was a little creeped out honestly) but I just wanted to know if you guys think that it is ok for him to fly over and just decide to join us? I felt that it was a little rude and disrespectful of our time together. His actions also raises a lot of flags in my head and I’m reallly worried that this might turn into a toxic relationship in the long run. I even cried while telling my friend about finding out a previous friend was in a toxic relationship after it had ended and it broke my heart knowing I was with her and yet didn’t know/couldn’t help. 

My friend mentioned that he didn’t seem to understand that I had social anxiety and that it was not ok to do what he did. She even had to beg him to understand and I felt so sad for my friend. She also didn’t seem to think that it was not ok for him to suddenly fly over without asking. She said it was only not ok if he had expected her to spend time with him without me. 

Also want to add in that she said that he was going to go for therapy. She’s also going for therapy too. She also told him I said there were some red flags and he was shocked by it. My friend kept mentioning that he was a good guy too and really wish we could meet but I told her to stop saying that as it’ll only pressure me more and make me withdraw from the situation completely.",Need some thoughts

Also, I suddenly feel very lightheaded like I'm going to pass out any minute. All this happens in a matter of seconds, and also only lasts for a few seconds until I'm conscious that it's happening and I can retake control. Often when it happened once it wil usually happen a few more times in the following hours.

Anyone got any clue what this is and why this is suddenly happening? Is it anxiety related?

I haven't been diagnosed with anxiety, but I'm pretty sure I might have some other symptoms too. I very often can't stop twitching my shoulder, I often feel the need to manually breathe and on very rare occasions - when I feel like I'm having a heart attack/stroke - my face starts tingling like crazy, as if a thousand ants were running around.

I don't care a lot about all of the above (although the twitching in public makes me look crazy sometimes), but the sudden frequent zoning out/lightheadedness freaks me out because one day people will for sure catch on that I slurred something out, and more importantly, I'm afraid that my lightheadedness might once get so serious that I pass out in a dangerous situation (on a bike, in a car etc.)

Thanks!","zoning out, lightheaded: could it be anxiety?"

What was she doing when I was going to get my nursing license?

I’m also irritated because the woman across the way constantly leaves stuff for days in our shared laundry machine but complains if you move it, and she also had a boyfriend that sexually harassed me for years.

I have to walk past it to get to my apartment, but they call me creepy because they constantly have their blinds open and say that I look in when I try to look down at my phone.They constantly passive-aggressively close the blinds like I’m trying to peep into their apartment.

2022-11-23 07:40:02,Anxiety,"Today I wanted to talk about ""dating/ sex anxiety"", so I warn that it'll be sex related mentions.

I don't see myself as someone unattractive, in fact, I'm pretty satisfied with my apparence, I'm pretty avarege looking but I like to take care of how I look to other people, dressing well and stuff.

I've lately been going to parties and going out more than usual and this stuff. Some of my friends are starting to hook up and have partners, but I've never even had my first kiss. I do feel attracted to some guys, and feel the desire to hook up with them, but always nothing happens, until I'm not interested in them anymore, or they just leave/ we lose contact. Or if ever something is about to happen I just try to avoid the situation because of my lack of experience, it makes me insecure about my performance.

Ideally, I'd like to make out with someone on a night club, in a state where I'm drunk and more willing to try things out. But even there, I'm not being apprached and even if I were I feel like I'd run away. Which also makes me question the fact that I might just be unattractive to other people.

Some people might say things like ""don't try to take things to fast"", or ""just wait until it happens"", but those are thoughts that are already in my mind and it's just not it. I'm not saying that I have to urge to lose my virginity asap, but I do want to start getting a bit of experience, the more time I wait, the more insecure I am and harder it gets.

I currently have a small crush on this guy who's a friend of mine, I don't want to date him but he really turns me on so I just want to hook up with him, but then again, I have so many thoughts in my mind, whether he likes me or not or if I try to make a move and I'm rejected, it'll super akward bc we see each other every day, etc.

I do go to therapy once every two weeks, and I thought about bringing this up. But I'm shy about it, I sound desperate...

2022-11-23 05:39:43,Anxiety,"I apologize if this comes off as rude, insensitive, or harmful. This isn’t my intention.

-x-

Recently, I had a friend offer to start a FWB relationship with him.

I, a 23 year old aromantic virgin, tried to explain to him that I’d be down to try, but not only did I have a history of CSA and frightening sexual encounters, but I was also terrified of HIV. I asked him to go slow, and asked him for HIV test results. So, he gave me the screenshotted results - negative - and assured me we could go nice and slow.

But here’s the thing:

I got his screenshot, yeah. It said he was clean, sure.

*But what if he faked them?*

What if he lied? What if he *does* have HIV and isn’t telling me the truth because he wants to do me harm? What go he faked the tests and is using someone else’s screenshots because he doesn’t have the money for testing but wanted to get with me anyway, therefore possibly having HIV and not knowing?

Irrational, right?

But he will wear a condom. Always. Me getting pregnant could get me killed, so I don’t play around with that. Hence, I should be just fine. Alas, my other irrationality comes in hot:

*But what if the condom breaks?*

What if it breaks and he doesn’t tell me because he wants to do me harm? What if it breaks, and he’s HIV positive, and has lied on that test to get with me thinking it’s totally safe but it isn’t because the condom broke?

You might say: “Bro, go get PEP, you’ll be okay.”

*But what if that doesn’t work or I didn’t know the condom broke and now I have HIV because he lied to me about his test because he wants to do me harm and now I have HIV and will die from it and be forever alone never to have sex again?*

…See my issue?

Phobias are so goddamn annoying. And terrifying. Mere hours ago I was ecstatic because I had a great time with him, and he’s a really fun, compassionate person. He’s never given me a reason to fear him, never given me a reason to think he’d lie to me.

And yet, here I am, absolutely horrified and verging on panic. I’m letting past experiences of lying and me being gullible as hell rule my life.

You wanna know what set this whole thing off in the first place?

I think he has clubbed fingernails.

That’s typically a sign of oxygen deprivation or difficulties circulating enough oxygen caused by heart or lung issues. Commonly from things like COPD, heart disease, lung cancer, or, you guessed it, AIDS.

And I said I *think* he has clubbed nails. I didn’t get a good look.

So this whole spiral of utter terror is stemming from an assumption, on top of a possibility, on top of betrayal and lies, on top of a low risk chance, on top of the unknown.

Instead of being concerned about him maybe having undiagnosed lung cancer, I’m scared about my possible risk to possibly nonexistent HIV.

But my depression and anxiety still shitting on me. I went to a psychiatrist and explained  to  her my fear and that even though I feel like I need some medication, I  don't want to risk having PSSD or even ED. She then  recommended me to take *Lithium Carbonate* at a low dosage (300mg). She didn't diagnose me as bipolar, but this medication  is used off-label to treat depression and anxiety,  apparently. I did  read good things about it and DIDN'T see anything on this subreddit  particularly about people who had PSSD strictly from it.

Yes, I've seen several posts  that scared me of people actually having ED   while using it, but from  what I understand, the side effects went away once they stopped the  medication. And, I'm not sure, but I presume it   was from a higher dosage. Like 900mg or 1000mg or even more.

After desvenlafaxine, psychiatrists prescribed me : trazodone, brintelix and wellbutrin. I didn't take any of these as there are some reports  about   PSSD among these drugs. *Lithium Carbonate* is the only one that was prescribed to me that gave me hope, but I'm still afraid to take it. As I said there are a few comments and even  papers about Lithium giving ED, but as far as I know, not permanent    damage.

I am writing because I am struggling with stress and anxiety lately, to the point that I cannot check my email regularly in case there is something I don’t want to see there. For context, there has NEVER been anything concerning in my inbox and once I check I am calmer. Then story repeats itself a few days later… This has been happening for about a year or more now and the fear is such that is even affecting my workflow. It sounds so silly because I tell myself it is just my negative thoughts flying around my head!!

2022-11-22 16:43:45,Anxiety,"So I M(15) and a girl I've been talking to F(14) , we've been talking for about 2 months, and we like each other alot, she is very good looking and funny, smart, all that. In middle school I was relentlessly bullied and hurt, because of my 6th grade gf. So believe it or not I was a edgy 6th grader who wanted attention and I said some dumb things for attention, and eventually after like a year she left me, admitted she had been having sex with a high schooler. So I was sad, and mad, and in my anger I said I could tell everyone she had sex with a high schooler.

 She took it horribly as you would guess and she told everyone all the stupid lies I said and I was horribly bullied for the rest of middle school, dont get me wrong I deserved it for a bit, but halfway through 7th I was a different person and realized what I did and I felt bad. But I was in a horribly cringey ""nerd"" group for the rest of middle school and I hated almost all of them.

 On the last day of 8th as i was walking home i cried tears of joy realizing I'm out of that friend group. It wasn't until I was out of middle school when i realized i have severe social anxiety, and for the first few months of freshman, I didnt care. It has ruined my relationship with my family, whenever they say something I  mumble and shrug, say idk and its not just them, its everyone but my friends I do this to. 

My grades are bad because of it, I dont ask for help and I have no motivation to do work, I just hate my life and myself for being such a social reject, people talk to me and they will say something funny, and I feel like I know what to say back but I just cant and I mumble or just smile and shrug. I hate it. So at the start of freshman, this girl I looked at in class all the time came up to me at the end of class and nervously walked up to me and asked for my snap, I typed it in and she walked out.

 I was so nervous and excited because that was the first time a girl has asked for my snap since 6th grade. Another thing to add, my friends target me and bully me, and they gave me shit for being nervous when that happened. When I got on the bus she texted me and we texted all the time and it was nice. 

Homecoming was coming up and she really wanted me to go but I was too nervous and just tried to brush her off even though I liked her. I was just too anxious to commit and I kept trying to brush her off. Her and her friend would come up and talk to me and flirt with me and obviously I would just shrug and mumble. But my friend said if I went with her he would go with her friend so I went, she looked so good in her dress, and we had a good time, although of course I said almost nothing to her.

 We danced together at the end ,and then I left. For more weeks, her and her friend would sit down with me and talk to me, and yup I still mumbled and shrugged and idked. Now on the text side of things with her, she was opening up to me and talked about things that have happned in her life, and I'm pretty good at helping people, so I comforted her over text and let her talk about it. 

I'm not going to say anything about her problems. So we were becoming closer and closer over text, yet in person I just couldn't speak still. Eventually she stopped talking to me in person and said if I dont talk, she wont talk, and i said that's fair, I've told her about why i mumble and shrug and she understands and promises that she wont lose interest and stay until I'm able to talk to her.

 I want to let you all know, she is very attractive and alot of guys and even good looking ones like her and they all actually are able to talk to her and make her laugh, and it makes me jealous but we arent dating so I try not to let it affect me. To Me, she has way better options and I still dont understand why, but she still chooses me, she still wants me and she promises she wont give up on me. Well recently her older sister said that until I can talk to her, we should just be friends, and that made her sad but thought it was reasonable, and I just agreed.

 More and more she responds less over text, never looks at me in class, talks and laughs with other guys. It makes me feel like shes losing interest but she is promising she isnt, and to let you know because of a suicide of one of her very close friends, she is very serious about promises and they mean alot to her so I know she is serious. Also, her friends have left her recently over something stupid. 

So now she lost her friend group. The past few days she responds very 30 mins to an hour and has been acting kinda different, and I think it's because her sister tried to kill herself, her friends left her, and her mom isnt that nice to her, I've been helping her through it but idk if I'm helping. I started taking ashwagandha ksm anxiety medicine so I can be able to talk to her, but it's been a week of 2 pills every morning and I'm noticing no changes in my social anxiety, and my grades are horrible and idk what to do. I just want to be able to talk to her so so bad. I want to be able to have a good relationship with her one day, I just want to be comfortable around her. Someone help me because if this anxiety medince doesn't work then i dont know what I'm gonna do. Help.

UPDATE: Her sister talked to her again and said we should be friends, again. Shes been texting me less and just now she said her ex broke up with his gf and he wants to be with her, and that he wants to hang out, so she is probably gonna go back with him, and she said she wanted to but wont and when I asked why she said I'm not allowed to know. I got in a fight today and punched my friend in the face and now I'm suspended. All my friends have now left me and my anxiety medicine has yet to work. The last few days, she told me to take a week to myself, to not text her for a week. I just know shes been texting her ex and probably already went and hung out with him, idk though. She had a photo of her saved in our chat and deleted it today, idk why. I just want to text her but I cant. I have nobody else since my friends left. I've realized since I dont have much else, I want to make it my goal to be able to talk to her and be with her.",social anxiety is ruining a possible relationship

2022-11-22 13:10:54,Anxiety,"My mid fourties are creeping up on me, by the time I post this, I’ll be another year older. 

I’ve been dealing with anxiety since I can remember, but it really became a life problem when I entered the workforce full time. Every day some silly work issue or other was treated as an urgent crisis, that of course had to be acted on with the energy of a thousand suns, because no job no home no food. Even while working one year, food insecurity was a major stressor, and I’d regularly end up living on stone soup for 3 days before the next paycheck. That was a long time ago, but sticks with me because I’d moved to a different country, then had the, seemingly trustworthy, employer cut my pay in half. Not going to touch other memories of completely missed paychecks in unstable companies. Our modern work culture has really rewired my brain. I find little enjoyment in anything anymore, where I was once highly engaged in charity activities and planning fundraisers and other community events in my free time, these days its gin and Netflix.

Without going through decades of tales of panic attacks and doctors and health anxiety (some unexpectedly justified) and poor coping and life management skills - even a couple hospitalizations - that stemmed from this battle, just wanted to say thanks to this community for sharing and facing it together. I read often but if I’ve posted, it hasn’t been in a very long time. And it helps to know I’m not alone in it. 

As much as the public buzz is that we can talk about mental health, there really is still a huge stigma talking about it. I’ve spent years on SSRIs and whatnot and finally have just found a kind of solution in ativan, meditation, healthy eating and excercise. With a bit of laughter about it all with friends in the same boat.

my physical symptoms just don’t stop. lately i’ve been having head pressure, shortness of breath, nausea, feeling weak/being shaky, chest tightness/ burning, stomach pains. I keep randomly getting these like “attacks” where I will suddenly feel like i’m going to pass out my heart races, I feel like I can’t breath, and I feel trapped inside my body. I cant go out, drive or even just be in a car anymore. I cant do anything. I panic every time I go out. 


mentally I’m struggling. Im never happy anymore. my emotions seem very dull. I always have a weird feeling almost like i’m scared or something. I feel like nothing matters and I don’t care about anything. I have 0 motivation to do anything. I feel like a failure I can never do anything. I’m so embarrassed to be me.

\-An odd feeling that I can't describe in the left side of my stomach.

\-Rapid heart beat that I can't control when trying to sleep. sort of in episodes

\-Throwing up almost every morning and during exercise.(I'm in relatively good shape and only throw up during tournaments)

\-I feel like I forget a lot of things that I should have no problem remembering.

\-Getting lost in my own head when trying to sleep causing me to stay awake a few hours past when I usually go to bed.

\-I think I overthink a lot of situations that I don't need to.

\-I have had two panic attacks in the past six years.

\-random itching before I go to bed

2022-11-22 12:10:08,Anxiety,"I’m writing this because I want to get this off my chest and hopefully show others that they need to try as hard as possible to not let their anxiety consume their lives.

I’ve recently come to the realization that I let my anxiety take over my life. I always knew that it was consuming me, but it didn’t hit me until TODAY. Looking back I really let anxiety take a lot of things away from me and I’m just now being a friend to myself and making progress because of this realization. 

One thing that anxiety took away from me was my ex who was my best friend. I was so consumed with anxiety for the past 6 months, that I didn’t even realize how much time was passing. Everyday felt like a blur because I was focused on health anxiety. Every single thing health related consumed me beyond belief. Going through this, I didn’t realize that I was letting my relationships slip away from me. Relationships with my ex, my friends and my family. I lost myself and didn’t realize it in the moment because my anxiety was consuming me on a daily basis, even up until recently in October. What made me realize that I was letting these things slip away from me was my ex getting in a new relationship. Knowing about his new relationship has been hurting me beyond belief BUT funny enough, this hurt is truly was an eye opener for me. As soon as I found out about the relationship, a serious bout of depression took over and through this, I realized that my anxiety let time slip away from me and let my relationship with my ex, my best friend, fizzle away. He told me that we “drifted apart” even though from my perspective, it didn’t feel that way, why? Because everyday felt like a blur and my anxiety wasn’t allowing me to realize how much time was passing since it was all I thought about. Every single worry consumed me. Even my mom would tell me that it seemed like I never wanted to talk to anyone, that I always seemed angry (my anxiety would also manifest in anger, especially towards loved ones). In some fucked up way, my bout of depression made me realize that my anxiety truly needed to be stopped because it’s taken so much from me. 

Do I want it to take more? Hell no. Looking at the notes app on my phone and seeing a sea of notes I’ve written throughout the past 6 months pains me. Every month, every week, I let anxiety dictate my life. Of course, when you have anxiety, you really can’t control  that you’re thinking this way, but my mistake, and I will admit it absolutely is a mistake on my part, was not getting help sooner. That help could’ve been therapy, books, meds, etc. I kept telling myself that I could deal with it on my own, that I could solve it by myself, no…no you couldn’t. For some reason I rejected getting help and it’s crazy because I’ve always told people to get help (whether it’s therapy, exercising, meds, etc) when it comes to their mental health. Sometimes I would help myself by diving into a book for a week or watching anxiety related videos for a day or two, but never stuck with it because I lacked discipline and anxiety would come right back so I let it build and build. So why did I neglect myself? Why didn’t I pick up that book that made me feel better? If something makes you feel better, why leave it behind? I wasn’t being kind to myself and most importantly, I wasn’t being a friend to myself. I would never let my friend go through what I went through on a daily basis without trying to aid her, so why did I let myself go weeks, months without help? I was self sabotaging without even realizing it. 

I started therapy at the start of this month and although I haven’t spoken with my therapist about this just yet, the fact that I’m able to rationalize and come to these conclusions now let’s me know that I’m headed in the right direction. I also want to add that my therapist told me to practice mindfulness and at first I wasn’t necessarily opposed to it, but I had doubts that it would actually help me BUT it has helped me. It allows me to be so much more present and that is something I was never able to do in the last 6 months. For 6 months I constantly thought about the future, I was living so much in the future that now I realize how much I missed. Another thing that has helped me become more present is reading The Power of Now. Whenever I read a page or a paragraph, I just get a wave of relief because it makes me feel so present. I think I’ve finally reached some sort of awakening because I’m actually being a friend to myself and I’m truly fighting for myself in a way that I haven’t before. Please be a good friend to yourself, you deserve happiness and a peaceful mind. You deserve to actually live your life.",Please don’t let anxiety take your life away from you

Now my socket aches sm and hurts quite a bit, and the bit under my arm hurts when I press it , did i pull a muscle or dislocate it? Is this an expected reaction? Should I go to the doctors? It does ache quite a bit haha.....this has happened before I think like 2/3 years ago? I was laying in bed and like twisted around to see something at my window propped up on my arm and it just kinda moved out of place and then went back in as soon as I moved an inch?

2022-11-22 07:57:49,Anxiety,"why are some people just mean for the sake of being mean? Or actively trying to be jerks and ruin people's day 😢

I had to stop playing online video games 5 or so years ago, because people were just so mean and nasty to each other, which caused me a TON of anxiety, even if none of the anger/rudeness was directed at me personally. Recently I've gotten back into some online games with friends, because it's my only way to socialize (I am somewhat home-bound). Often we're having a good time, and two or three people will come in/join the game and just be awful/mean, their only purpose to wreck a good time other people were having. ""Trolling"" might be the correct term. No idea what these people look like or where they are from, they could be some vulgar middle schoolers for all I know. They will be mean to my friends (who are all incredibly nice to everyone) and it all just feels so uncomfortable, it feels like we're all getting insulted/attacked together at the same time. 

Those people will be banned/booted from the game, or we will all just exit the game, so it's resolved fairly quickly, but it sticks with me for a while, like once trouble starts brewing, my heart immediately starts pounding and won't stop for hours, bad anxiety, chest tension, multiple mini nightmares about the situation when trying to sleep &amp; constantly waking up panicked, sleeping terribly. I'm so tired of dealing with this crap :( - It's an awful feeling, and it continues for the next day as well, I just feel like shit all day.

A lot of this is on me, I doubt any of my friends are stressing out about it anywhere nearly as much as I do every time. I'm sure they think it sucks, but they probably aren't even thinking about it anymore an hour or two later, they've likely mostly forgotten about it. 

but being as sensitive as I am, these incidents stick with me very much, and it's truly painful. When experiencing this horrible anxiety I'm all too familiar with, one of my gut reactions is (trigger warning: suicide, don't need to read it) &gt;!Oh shit, I remember this horrible feeling...I don't want to feel this feeling ever again, I've already gone through this hundreds of times and it feels so miserable. I just want it to end, I don't want to feel this feeling anymore, I don't want to be alive anymore, why would I want to continue to live in this world where people are so cruel for no reason?!&lt;

I would really appreciate some advice, or even book recommendations, on how to better handle these things.

So a few weeks back, a girl told us during the weekly meetings for people with anxiety on the Humans Anonymous app that she struggled with being in places where a lot of people talked at a time. And not just that, also places like church where the priest talks loud, I'm sure you get it.

Another girl then gave a pretty good advice. Buy noise-cancelling headphones, listen to music at like 20-30% volume, it really doesn't have to be loud. That way, you can be at places like church, look at the priest moving his mouth and not hear a single word. 

The girl took this advice to heart, went out and bought a pair.

A few weeks after at another anxiety meeting, she put her hand up to speak. She told us about the advice given by girl I mentioned before. She then went on to tell us how she tried it out after buying a pair of noise cancelling headphones. Wow, she was shocked. She now went multiple days without any anxiety attacks.

2022-11-22 06:23:30,Anxiety,"I'm having a rather bad day anxiety wise, and its not like I'm doing anything at all. There is nothing presently that I should be feeling anxious about and yet it feels like I'm being sucked through the floor and I can't move, almost like I'm in quicksand up to my neck and as much as I try to get out, nothing changes, I'm still stuck. You know that feeling when you are a kid and you've just gotten in trouble with your parents, that horrible twisting in your gut. That feeling has been with me all morning and I hate it. I hate it so so much. I feel like I'm falling off a cliff, being punched in the stomach and being chased after all at the same time. My heart has been pounding out of my chest and if I stop to think about something for too long I start to cry. I'm so tired of it. I've had persistent anxiety and the depressies for about half my life now, these past 12 years or so. I can't get it to stop. I've nothing to be stressed over today and yet my body feels like I'm about to be murdered. It honestly feels like experiencing each one of the F's, fight, flight and freeze all at the same time and it's fucking horrible 

It's a horrible feeling to have, I shouldn't be so scared right now, I shouldn't feel such impending doom when there's no active threat. The most stressful thing I have to experience today is getting on a bus which I do every week anyways and it's not stressful at all. 

And the kicker is, when there actually is an emergency, I feel totally in control of myself. I react faster and easier than the other people around me and I know it's because I already know what to expect emotionally and physically from my body and mind because I deal with those shotty feelings every single damn day. I thrive in terrible situations because during actually threatening events, my emotions actually make sense. And goddammit do I hate it.  It's like a switch gets flipped in my head and all of a sudden I'm Master fuckin Oogway and I'm filled with inner peace and I know all the secrets to the universe. I know what to do, and I do it. Because my emotions are finally working when they need to and how they need to. 

I just want to be able to function day-to-day in the way I do during emergencies. I want to feel in control of myself and for some fucky wucky reason that only happens during the extremely shitty times in life. And ""sadly"" they only come about once a month in my case.

I mean, life happens. And sometimes life presents situations that are sometimes stressful - but anxiety just adds so much unnecessary and irrational thoughts towards a situation, that it’s enough to make feel insane.

It has been very well managed with therapy and medication, and I have been symptom free for the past two years with a few exceptions (notably travelling)

I have always wanted to be a mom. I cannot see my life without a child/children. 

But I am terrified of pregnancy. 

My panic disorder was brought on by a very major shoulder surgery that had a very long, painful recovery… my panicked brain wanted to go “back in time and undo it” - I wanted the hardware out of my shoulder and some days I wanted to go back to the hospital to have them take out all of the icky stuff. 
My panic disorder made me become unhealthily skinny and my resting heart rate was 120-160bpm. I am now at a very comfortably healthy weight, have a healthy RHR, eat well, and exercise regularly. 

I am terrified that I will experience the same panic during pregnancy (wanting to “undo” it/not be pregnant anymore) and create an unhealthy environment for our fetus to develop in (ie panic leading to extreme weight loss and unhealthy cortisol levels)

So … I’m asking anyone who can, to please share their positive outcome stories with me, please!!!

Now, I've (earlier) had therapy every week for 2 years straight, and it has helped a lot, but something strange has now begun for a few months ago.

This is a grim understatement, but I started with social anxiety, then had a drug overdose, and started having serious heart anxiety. Now, my social anxiety has gone away a lot, and my heart anxiety that used to consume my entire daily life, has become nothing but a short problem, that flares up sometimes, when I fore example take the bus or transit to work.

But... Before in times, getting my hair cut at the barber, that used to be a normal time, a time I even felt calm doing when the most of my entire day was composed of walking around in circles doing repetetive movements to stop myself from thinking there was something wrong with my heart, has now been destroyed out of nowhere.

I didn't used to have a problem getting my hair cut even when my anxiety was at its worst, but now that my life is pretty stable, I get a fucking panic attack everytime I have to get my hair cut, and I just don't understand!

Today I got my hair cut, and it still was a bit of a fuck-up, so that's why the post.. Didn't drink or smoke this time for two days, meditated for half an hour beforehand and even visualized myself in the situation to get acquainted for the moment since the day before and STILL, spent the majority of the time clenching the shirt of my chest and being unable to breath properly..

2022-11-22 03:50:43,Anxiety,"""You're just scared of what people think of you!""

Whenever people ask me about my anxiety the topic normally comes around to people's opinions.

Most people I talk to seem to think those with such social anxiety are scared of what people think of them. I guess it can be true to some degree and it depends on the person how much they care. Also people always care what friends and family think on some level.

Personally, I feel my social anxiety isn't about other people's opinions it's more about a fear of people looking at me and noticing my existence. I don't want to be noticed good or bad. If people say good things or compliment me it can still stress me out. I am highly critical of myself and I feel no judgment from public would ever be as harsh as my own.

I'm not sure if this has a different name or not or how common this might be.

I'm not unhappy though, I wish I didn't feel as stressed as I do when being noticed because it's uncomfortable but on my own I am happy with my partner and friends and family I have. I don't feel bored or lonely I just don't want to be seen/noticed or around people.",Fear of being seen or noticed?

Im 19 years old, and have no friends anymore. Its my own fault for isolating myself so much and not being able to manage my anxiety, i know this but i dont know how to change. When i try to reach out to people and make friends, even just online, i end up freezing up and not knowing what to say, or if i do know what to say i constantly feel like everything i say and do is so incredibly awkward and i sound stupid. 

My brain constantly replays embarassing moments in my life and stupid or awkward things ive said and it genuinely makes me physically cringe. I dont know how to stop this, i dont know how to stop overthinking and hyperanalyzing everything i do and everything people say to me, but i can never stop no matter how hard i try. It makes me not want to talk at all. It makes me want to just hide and be alone, so i dont have to stress over every little social interaction i have.

 I feel so disconnected from everyone, even family, but especially myself, its like i dont feel like im connected to this body i have and its a horrible feeling. I go through every day feeling this way and acting like i dont, i go to work and talk to people as normally as i can manage and try to just prerend i dont feel like im running on autopilot.

I understand not everyone thinks this way or is not always available and that's okay. 

  
However sometimes my friend will go like a day or two days before replying and continuing the conversation right where we left off.

Further, I genuinely want to reply right away but I don't want to come across as clingy. So now I feel like I have to wait a similarly long time before I reply.

2022-11-21 16:19:29,Anxiety,"I started suffering from GAD 2 years ago at the start of the pandemic. According to a therapist I started seeing shortly after I've been dealing with undiagnosed anxiety from childhood, but it came to a head with my first panic attack that had a snowball effect when it started. I spent a month balled up in a corner having waves of panic attacks (I'm a mom so imagine the kids worry). The doctors immediately prescribed Xanax which made month 2 even worse, the depersonalization was hell, I wasnt gettung any sleep, along with the fear of dying due to the constant palpitations. I remember looking in the mirror and feeling like i was looking at a familiar stranger. I was trapped in my jead but this body was unformiliar. I quickly slipped into depression. My friend suggested it was depression when we went for a walk on a windy and overcast day, I told her I knew the wind was blowing because I could see the trees moving, I could hear it, but I couldn't feel it. I didn't know if I was cold or not because I couldn't feel. My doctor confirmed that it was depression.

I told the doctor I didn't like the way Xanax made me feel (not feel) and that I wanted to deal with my illness without medication (I hate taking medication). I have health anxiety, anything prescribed I read up on. The first horrible side effect I see, convinces me to not take the meds and send me into panic. I am also guilty of googling up any little sensation by body feels (results are always I'm gona die or live a painful life).

The depression eventually subsided after stopping my mess and I thought I was managing things ok, but recently my anxiety has been eating me alive. I recently landed a dream job, I'm doing what I like to do, pay is great, family is insured and I get to travel. But I'm unable to enjoy any of it, my heavy worried start from the airport (I have a fear of flying) then the whole trip I get no sleep because I'm awake having panic attacks for reasons unknown. When I get home my body crashed but the anxiety continues, it really feels like it's getting out if hand but I'm afraid to go to my doctor because I DO NOT want to go back on medication and I know that will be his first plan of action. I don't want to experience those feelings again, the void of depression. But I'm crying  everyday in the shower because I can't control my anxiety. Any suggestions?",Stuck....GAD

The thing is, he isn’t wrong. I love him to death but I overthink everything everytime I’m with him. I need therapy or something. I don’t think I was loved enough as a child so I live in fear the people I love won’t love me. Honestly fuck my dad for making me feel unloved (besides the point lol). I love my friends and bf so much they are really the most positive things in my life but I don’t know how to stop overthinking. I end up ruining my days with the people I love and making my life a living hell. Someone please help me.

2022-11-21 14:41:51,Anxiety,"*This started out as a comment on an r/science post about physical signs of depression. The thread took a turn towards the topic of anxiety, and I was asked about my process of balancing physical and mental health. It was unfortunately removed by a moderator, but I got enough positive feedback that I thought it may help someone here. Please take this as my personal story and form of expression. I am not an expert in this field and only wish to bring hope and open my heart for those who are lost. Please ask questions and share your own journeys!! I love this stuff* 

Ok…here’s my story of the past 5-10 years of my life. disclaimer: a lot of this sounds dreamy but there is no other way I know how to tell stories than by trying my best to honestly paint a picture. This is gonna be looooong so bear with me. But if I help one person reading this, that’s all I need. 

Circumstance and an awesome support system led me to therapy first. But actually, the very first step was literally looking at myself in the mirror the night after I blacked out and cheated on my ex. I stripped down everything about myself in that moment. I recognized I was lost, and listened to the tiny dim spark in the back of my mind that almost went out. 

I could say it a million times. “This isn’t you. You’re not a cheater.” But then I caught my own glance in my reflection. My eyes were in despair, and my mind was yelling at me “THIS ISNT YOU. YOURE NOT A CHEATER.” And I caught a glimpse of a tiny dim ember in that girl’s face. It was the Death Star flaw that led to my dark side’s final demise. A tiny hole through all of the giant walls (disguised as strengths in my stubborn mind) I saw the tiny ember of truth in the mirror. “You did this. You are a cheater. This is you now. Fix it.”

If you’ve ever seen westworld, there’s a part where Dolores is sitting in front of herself and there is a maze… a path that leads to her core. Her self. The purest form of herself. If she works her way through the maze, she gains freedom. 

I took that scene and applied it to my life. When was the last time I was truly happy? I need to find that self again. She’s not gone. She’s lost and you can find her. Just do some searching. 

Then I started truly listening. To art, to friends, to movies. Believing people and their struggles. Learning that I can literally relate to anyone and understand anyone on this planet. 

I didn’t realize this all when I looked in the mirror. But the mirror was the first step. Very very slowly, patterns started to form. When I watched movies or listened to podcasts, I learned patterns of negative behavior and started applying them to my own personal memories. Truly forgiving myself for my mistakes. And then appreciating those mistakes as lessons instead of hiding from them in shame. Take the power back with understanding and patience. 

Take new paths in your brain instead of the deep ugly trenches that have formed as you got farther away from the freedom of childhood. The grass feels so great and new. You’ll fall back into those deep paths on the journey, but slowly, you’ll realize that the maze is leading you away from the center. If you can find a way to rethink and cut through the trenches that form the maze, and focus on the goal of finding the center and finding freedom. It is not an aha moment. It’s never an epiphany, it’s more of a warm glow. And more about looking back with forgiveness and looking forward with hopefulness. And knowing that you’re where you need to be now. 

Then I visualized myself on this quest like Frodo. Or Bojack. Or George Carlin. Even people that I don’t  agree with. I don’t hate anyone anymore. I look at them and say, I can see how I would end up that way given their life history and today’s society. Kanye-I don’t agree with him but why hate him? 

He paid for his mom’s surgery that led to her death. And he had a lot of power. His mind is protecting himself from that raw truth. And it is displayed in his actions. His ego grew so that his guilt wouldn’t kill him. I’m not immune to that. I’m not immune to control issues, anxiety. What I can control is how I think about things. Instead of saying wow Kanye sucks, I think deeper. My mind wants to react that way and it wants to just get away from him. But that reaction means there’s more thinking to do. And that reaction is me not thinking I’m capable of the same thought patterns that led him down that path. It’s my shame saying ‘yeah he’s different than me so I can hate him-I’ll always hate him because I’m not like him.’ Every time you hate somebody, it’s just your own insecurities taking you down. Being understanding of other people is my way of understanding and accepting myself. I’m thankful I’m not in the public eye like he is, and I’m also thankful that I can keep myself in check by trying to relate to people I don’t understand. 

I now do this with everyone in my life. Truly hearing them, and recognizing that people that lash out at me are doing so because of their issues. Not me. I know myself and I know my heart and I have the tools to explain myself if I hurt someone’s feelings. 

There is so much more to this, it might be easier to answer questions rather than try to explain the immense amount of work I’ve done in my late 20s/early 30s. It’s all worth it!!! So ask away if you have more questions. If anyone stuck with me to this point-thank you.

This ruins my sleep because I wake up mid panic as soon as I get close to sleep because I’m convinced that I’m going to die.

I have Anxiety, ADHD, CPTSD and Depression. It's why I didn't think dating was a good idea for me in school and basically didn't date, at first on purpose and then because every time I tried it went up in flames lol 

I'm doing a lot better now mentally than I was in school so it's not like I've been against dating, but my life is boring and the only way to find someone to date is to go places lol. 

I have a crush on a guy who works at the 7/11 down the street, but it took me 6 months to ask for his socials let alone number or for a date 😵‍💫

Another guy who works the morning shift who I've talked to a few times in the last month ask me out this morning though and I didn't really have a reason to say no, so YOLO why not ya know? He first asked if I wanted to get Mexican with him tomorrow for lunch but I have something to do tomorrow so now we're getting (breakfast food chain) for breakfast on Tuesday 😗 I'm not a morning person or a eating before 11 kinda person but IDK LEAVE ME ALONE I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I'M DOING I DIDN'T WANNA SAY WHY DON'T WE GET BREAKFAST AT THE MEXICAN PLACE CAUSE I LIKE IT BETTER THAN WAFFLES! and 9 am is kinda early for a night shift person but IDK LEAVE A ALONE I DIDN'T WANNA TELL HIM I DON'T USUALLY EVEN HET UP BEFORE 9.

I'm extremely nervous, I'm kinda trying to think of this as a practice date since I barely know the guy 🫠 it's the only thing keeping me somewhat calm 🫠

2022-11-21 14:06:20,Anxiety,"Hi everyone! I am 22 years old and have never had issues with anxiety but I believe I am now. Since this is all so new to me, my ignorance to it all is making it that much worse. It’s really hard for me to discern between “I am dying of a heart attack/brain bleed/stroke” and “I will be okay and this panic will pass.” So, to help ease my fears of heart issues, can you guys explain to me what your panic attacks feel like? 

For me, im not having direct triggers and I think that’s why i’m even more anxious about it being a heart issue. For some context, the last 2 years of my life have been so horribly tragic and I have been so busy in college that I truly haven’t been able to heal from/work through any of these things. I believe that i’ve finally reached a point where I can’t push back any more trauma and my physical body now has to suffer because of it. I will randomly get very very dizzy, and then within 30 minutes I feel this entire flush type of feeling that goes down my whole body. After that I am sweaty, my heart is racing, my vision is alittle wierd, and it’s really hard to breathe. It then creates a terrible cycle because I panic even more thinking that i’m having a heart attack or something. However, if i can calm myself down enough to actually understand that i am okay, it passes shortly after. It does leave me feeling pretty tired though.

Long story short, I've been using CBD (cannabidiol, not THC) to manage my anxiety. It helped a bunch for a while and still does now. My sleep got overall better and my head spins less, but still.

And even if I have less episodes on insomnia, when it happens it's really bad.

That in itself is making me feel extremely anxiousness bc of the embarrassment, but that’s not even half the problem. I have multiple medical conditions that can cause life threatening complications very easily as well as severe OCD and SPD, bc of this I haven’t been exposed to “the outside world” as much as most people my age or even a lot younger, have been. I rarely socialize at all, I didn’t even have my first sleepover til I was 17, and I don’t currently have any friends. My social life has always been very limited but it really went to shit a few years ago and it’s really taken a toll on how I am able to interact with people, and the lack of consistency with relationships and socialization throughout my life has made doing anything social feel like more stress than it’s worth. What really makes me feel powerless is the combination of physical and mental health issues, if I have a panic attack I can actually pass out or go into a really weird seizure like neurological episode, if I shut down mentally my body shuts down too, so it just makes it all so much more complicated than it has to be. I also have extreme paranoid of peoples intentions, like to the point where I automatically feel like the person I am with is a danger. does anyone have any advice on how I can at least get past the embarrassment about my lack or experience or just any advice at all?

I'm just tired.
I don't know what's wrong with me. I'm so sick of having health anxiety. Been dealing with this sh!t since 2019.
I developed anxiety as a result of repressing my negative emotions as a defense mechanism. For almost my entire life.
In 2019, I probably went to the ER at least 10 times  and visited at least 30 doctors. I also developed rhinitis, probably due to all the stress.
My anxiety was mostly fine, but right now is kicking me in the a$s. I hate feeling the numbness in my arms, my face, my legs, then getting sweaty hands and feet, it makes me jump on my sit absolutely terrified because I am sure I am about to die.
Even tho it happens every. Single. Freaking. Time.i am profoundly convinced this is it, this is the one, the doctors were wrong, I am going to die.


I realized I manifest anxiety attacks and panic attacks when something bothers me deeply, but for some reason, due to a defense mechanism, I can't feel the emotion that this situation should provoke in me.
I don't know how anger feels like. I have dreams about myself screaming my lungs out. But I can't do that in real life.

Right now, someone who I was trying to get away from, was texting me. I didn't feel anything in particular, I was keeping it together, and then my whole face and arms went NUMB. Then sweaty. And I feel like I'm having a stroke, or something else.

I just wanna be able to feel the emotions like a normal human being. Right now I just made a bad movement and my chest hurts, I think I might have destroyed my heart apart or something. If that's that's possible.

Finding this out has completely destroyed me. Just yesterday he was telling me how much he loved me and I just wonder if he followed that one girl right after he said that.

I've had friends over the years but barely connect with any now and cut people outta my life because all i want is to surround myself with loyalty

For example it comes on into small inconveniences like being asked to cover shifts, I'll now get anxious until I start work and essentially spend my whole day angry that I wasted my time anxious.

2022-11-21 08:47:45,Anxiety,"So I’ve had an anxiety disorder for as long as I can remember and panic attacked started before my teens, it’s been a long journey of therapy, different medications and belief in myself but I’m at a point where I wouldn’t fit the criteria if I asked to be re-diagnosed. I feel a lot better BUT I want to share with you what life after recovery is like, and what to keep in mind. 


Blips will happen; 

I say blips because anxiety never really goes away, but you will have times where old symptoms come back and anxiety feels unmanageable. This is normal and fully expected, however after a lot of trial and error my blips get shorter and I recover a lot faster. It’s about noticing when you don’t feel well and implementing your self care toolbox as soon as possible. That said if your like me your body needs time to get better regardless of the situation, your only human.. a blip can be anywhere between a few weeks or two months for me. 


Medication is not failure; 

I sometimes need to go back to medication to get my emotions back to baseline and that’s ok, people take medication for all sorts of reasons and anxiety is no different if you struggle to get back to baseline. I don’t see medication as a failure anymore but as an indication I need to take more time to listen to my body and my needs. Medication is normal. 


Let yourself feel what’s going on, but know when it’s anxiety talking; 

Anxiety is an emotion and you have to feel it, no amount of therapy and medication will rid you of it. Acknowledge the reasons you feel anxious and try to be as objective as possible, what I mean is limit thoughts like ‘oh no I’m losing it’ and change it to ‘ok we’ve been here before, what’s set me off and is it realistic?’ 

Know the difference between problem solving and ruminating or catastrophic thinking. First, you can’t stop the crazy thoughts… they still happen to me and I still think I’m crazy or doomed sometimes. But with mindfulness and separating my emotions from actual fact is really important to stop the spiral. Notice when your thinking goes from ‘how can I fix this’ to ‘how would I deal with the worst world ending scenario’ one of these is problem solving and one is my idea of the mental version of poking a bruise and expecting it to stop hurting. If your constantly looking for the worst outcome to somehow solve it… your instead lighting up your fear response endlessly by adding value to your fears and giving them more time than they need. By asking yourself’ what could go wrong?’ Your telling your brain the fear is valid and thus feeding the stress response that causes.  This is extremely difficult to get out of but is the single thing that has stopped my anxiety getting out of whack. Firstly note how long you worry about a particular thing and realise that more time thinking often does not mean more solutions, only more panic. Cutting down your rumination time is key. Mindfulness, meditation and yoga are great practice to shift your focus… at really bad times I use audiobooks to stop me fixating on unhelpful thoughts. 

Anxiety is sometimes just your physical needs not being met; 


My genuine advice to any of my friends suddenly experiencing weird fears or getting overwhelmed more easily than usual is to have them look at their lifestyle first. Have you been sleeping enough? What is your diet like? Have you been exercising? Have you been ill lately? Illness and stress can be huge factors in anxiety and my anxiety tanks if I forget to go for a walk or start eating poorly. Sometimes it helps to ask a doctor to help with sleep and diet before trying anxiety medications as it’s often a big cause for emotional upset. Interestingly my anxiety goes through the roof when I’m I’ll and I have to remind myself to be kinder to myself and believe the anxiety will get better with time. 



Lastly. Your not alone, anxiety is an emotion to be felt on a spectrum… there is no normal. There is always something new to try to help.",What I’ve learned from being in remission

Like if I don't do the compulsion then people might die, or I might get bad luck or I might get infinite anxiety or... and it just doesn't end.

I have scrupulosity OCD and this is currently what's happening to me,

I have been thinking a lot “black color is a nice color” I ended up repeating and starting over 666 times. Now my ocd tells me because I have done it 666 times I’m a racist. O and while working I saw a customer with a devil shirt and I read something about devil in the shirt. Now ocd is worst.

If I follow what the doctor says, he would tell me “say that there is something going to happen to black color people” probably he will tell me that. he wants me for me to say that to look for ocd and trigger and build up a huge amount of anxiety. he told me thats the way to do this.

How on earth can I accept this and say this? I would feel extremely guilty and bad. saying “I’m against black color” or “I dont like black color” will be wrecking to me.

what can I do? I have a headache and feel bad. I can’t function well.

if I keep repeating then it can get worst.

I know I’m not racist, but how on earth is telling my ocd that im racist will solve this problem? or look for the ocd?

2022-11-21 08:07:34,Anxiety,"Hi, I know this is going to sound kind of odd. I’ve been struggling with like paranoia and I’ve had sexuality issues. Everyone always thinks I’m gay and I’ve had a problem with my family consistently believing that I’m gay almost my whole life. I’m a girl btw. 

During the lockdown I was smoking so much weed and I think that only worsened my problems and being with my family, especially my dad because he would always question me about my sexuality, and so one day I was smoking with my best friend and she mentioned her other friend and that that friend was a lesbian and without even thinking I made a weird face. Almost like on a reflex I was used to doing whatever I could to show I’m not gay and it just carried into that conversation with my friend. She immediately seemed kind of upset and left shortly after. We’ve still hang out and talk since then but I always worry that she hates me, we’re not as close as we used to be. 

Like a year ago I ended up having a crush on another girl. It’s funny because I was so hung up on people questioning my sexuality and it made me insecure, and then I ended up liking a girl and it kind of settled it. I’m more comfortable with the topic of sexuality now and while I’m not 100% gay and I prefer men I know I can be attracted to men and women. I told my friend about it too and she was glad I talked about it and was able to be open about the fact that she was questioning her own sexuality too. 

We’ve never talked about that time when we were talking about her friend and I made a face but I still worry about it a lot, like one of those cringe memories you can’t get rid of. I hope she doesn’t think I have a problem with gay people and obviously now she probably knows I don’t but I can’t stop thinking about that moment and what she thinks about it. I know this whole post probably sounds insane and I’m worried it might sound insensitive or something but I don’t know. I’m just really freaking out. I don’t want to talk about it with anyone IRL because it does sound so insane. I hope she doesn’t even like remember it.

Hi all, 25 M white 5’10 175lbs 

About a month ago I was a bit constipated.  I’ve had a very stressful past 6 months and had bouts of constipation.

I managed to eventually go to the bathroom and all was good.  Then a day or 2 later I had a BM that was hard as a rock and caused sharp/piercing pain.  I check and there were streaks of red blood on it.

The next day was the same thing.  I also had a second bowel movement and no blood.

Day 3 I had a speck of blood and was able to get a lady minute appt with my GI that same day.

She did a rectal exam and found an internal hemorrhoid and a small anal fissure.  She told me to increase my fiber because I was probably at about 5-10g a day.

For 2 weeks I was having revalue bowel movements and sometimes even twice a day.  Was prob getting over 30 g of fiber.  No blood.  

Then, at the end of the 2 weeks since the last drop of blood on poop, I had diarrhea after trying nutritional yeast and saw a little bit of blood in it.  Saw little bit of blood for the next 2 days. 

It went away for one week but my anxiety spiked extremely hard.  I was gassy, would have to poop or felt like I had to poop after every meal.  Soft BMs.  I was also applying internal hemorrhoid cream for 5 days.

Then today I had diarrhea and saw a significant amount of maybe maroon blood in some of the mucus.  

Other than that I have been getting some tailbone pain.  

I am 100% convinced that I have colon cancer.  I literally don’t know what else could cause this.  I’m fucking freaking out.  Gastrointestinal Dr is doing a flex sig in 1 week on 11/28 and I am convinced I have it ",Convinced I have colon Cancer

Sometimes even not so loud outside music bothers me , i dont know how to explain it , like i wish everything was really silent all the time.

I was on Lexapro for 10+ years and it worked very well for me. Reduced my anxiety significantly and allowed me to live my life normally. Unfortunately it stopped working. I then was recommended to wean off Lexapro which I did for a three week period and then start Effexor. I was on Effexor for three weeks which didn't help and after doing a gene's test, I was recommended to go on to Pristiq.

I am on my second week of Pristiq (SNRI) for anxiety and my anxiety is at all time highs. I have not had any other side effects apart from severe anxiety and panic - more so than I had before starting this.

My question is - is it normal to have really strong anxiety for the first few weeks until it starts to work, or is this a sign that this medication may not be for me?

In other words, is it common for the anxiety to get worse before it gets better?

I'm wondering if someone with similar anxiety as mine can give me some advice. I've known I have anxiety from my late teens/early twenties, but I haven't been able to pinpoint every single thing it comes from. I've been diagnosed general anxiety, but like many people, I think it's a rollercoaster of a spectrum for me and my triggers. Currently, I am unable to get transportation to the clinic that's open to me to go to therapy, and I don't trust the general practitioner to hear me out and give me meds that will help the deeper issues.
Recently I've learned of HOW bad my anxiety is when it comes to outside expectations. Whenever I am confronted with a change in my plan ahead of time to even just go to the grocery store, my chest gets heavy and I can't think of anything except what's right in front of me and getting through it. I cannot hold a conversation or think of anything more complicated than simply getting in and getting out. And this happens at work too, when I am suddenly expected to do more than what I already know (without at least one other person in the building that knows more than me), on top of which it's time sensitive (customers expecting a quick fix). I could not think. When I called my manager,  I could hear them but their words turned to mush. And when I could understand, my brain still couldn't connect their instructions to the screen and buttons in front of me. Sometimes when things like that happen I have to go to the bathroom and cry while hyperventilating. Besides that, sometimes it's to the point where very basic every day expectations weigh heavy on my anxiety. Thinking about a very basic task while doing something else or just resting, it gnaws and gnaws at me, but I physically cannot get my body to do it.

2022-11-20 12:23:04,Anxiety,"So I’ve been thinking about a lot of things lately. I haven’t been overly anxious about them for a while but mostly just thinking on them until the past couple days. I don’t want to make this an unnecessarily long post, so I’ll try to keep it short and simple. 

So it did end up being a bit long. I understand if people don’t have time or want to read it, but I would appreciate it any that do. I’m partly writing this as a way to get everything on my mind out and also to get advice, reassurance, and hear people with stories that have faced similar things.

What really tied it all together for me and brought on this recent anxiety was reading about the relationship between life span and height. Basically, the idea that shorter people tend to live longer than taller people, and taller people are at a higher risk for all sorts of diseases and conditions. Also seeing quotes like “this is why you don’t see many 6’5 people in their 80’s”. As a fairly young (25) and tall (6’4) guy, this just sends me into a spiral of health and existential anxiety. I have seen tons of people talk about how “I know all these people who were 6’5 and lived into their 90’s”, and I know being a little tall isn’t a death sentence or anything. Just reading about these different studies and conclusions makes me anxious as a relatively tall person. 

I feel like this anxiety was compounded with and made worse by other things I’ve been thinking about. For example, I’ve had high blood pressure issues since at least 18 and have been taking medicine since 19. Thankfully, the medicine has worked well and my BP has been very well controlled and normal for the most part. I still can’t help thinking, “But I’m so young to have blood pressure issues like this. That must mean something is wrong with me and will shorten my life or just bad genetics that will shorten my life”. This also isn’t helped by my family on mom’s side having a history of heart issues and diabetes along with diabetes on my dad’s side. It’s hard to not think like this, and I don’t even really know who to talk to for a more clear and credible answer on issues like that. 

Alcohol has also been giving me some anxiety lately. Not like physical anxiety from actually drinking alcohol but more so reflecting on how much I drank in college and sort of reassessing my current relationship with alcohol. In college, 18-23 or so, I drank entirely too much. It wasn’t like I had a dependency or anything, but more so just being in college and drinking I guess. I worry that I’ve done some irreversible damage or set the ball rolling for future diseases and issues related to alcohol. 

Since then and over the past couple years, I have realized how dangerous to health alcohol can be and have brought my drinking down to very moderate levels. I have a bit of a passion for wine and will drink around a bottle a week over the dories of 2-3 days. Some weeks I might have a beer or extra glass of wine if I haven’t already drank anything that day or night. I guess I’m trying to say that I enjoy alcohol for the taste and understanding the culture, history, and industry behind different products such as wine, beer, and whiskey. Now that I drink at light to moderate levels, they’re saying “no amount of alcohol is safe and can still cause health issues”. So when I do just have a glass or wine or think about having one, it’s hard not to think, “Well I’m just slowly killing myself” or things like that. It’s stressful and annoying, because I want to do everything I can to stay pretty healthy in general, and especially while I’m younger. But I also know that I don’t have a problem with alcohol in terms of addiction or abusing it and enjoy a glass or two of wine. I’m trying to figure out how to balance these conflicting ideas in my head.

Lastly, there’s a few other things that have been weighing on me, but I won’t go into too much detail on them. I’ve had this small lump behind my ear for a few months now. I first noticed it when it was like a small marble size, and it’s only gotten smaller and is like a small bead now. My main doctor has seen it and wasn’t overly concerned about it and just said to watch it. It’s hard not to think about it being something more serious, but I don’t want to seem crazy or burden doctors more with it. I’ve also found myself worrying about dementia a lot lately. Just reading about it seeing videos of people on tik tok with it hasn’t helped. I know it’s pointless to worrty about that right now, but sometimes I find myself wondering if the fairly bad concussion I had a few years back will cause me to have it one day. 

Thanks to anyone who’s read any or all of this. It’s just been a lot of things that have played off each other to cause this recent bout of anxiety.","Had a few things sort of on my mind for a while, and now they’re coming together to create a big rabbit hole of an existential, hypochondria anxiety narrative in my head.

2022-11-20 12:19:34,Anxiety,"hi everyone, I wanted to share what happened last night with a friend and I that has left me shaken. 

to be as brief as possible, I am and she was 20&amp;21 F and we went to a pub to listen to some live music. we recorded a few songs they played but later on in the night there was this guy who seemed abit older than us dancing differently? a little wild honestly and he even came up to my friend and I when we were sitting down and put his foot on our table (like the stretching stance) and was dancing like tht for 10 seconds. I personally didn’t look at him during that. I didn’t like it but I was to shocked to say anything. 

about 5ish minutes go by, (I will also say for a while the crowd had all their backs to us so we couldn’t see the band) so when it cleared up I went to record abit of the song and when this guy saw I was recording , he stared at me, stopped dancing and walked up to me and pretty much grabbed my phone/camera but didn’t take it away. he got in my face yelling to not record him and if I want to, go stand right in the front and I was so taken aback. he might’ve been also on something but I’ve been being hard on myself for recording in the first place but i’ve recorded live music&amp; dancing before and nobody has ever had an issue. to be honest, I felt really overwhelmed and scared and I did start crying. 

we told security what happened and he got kicked out but this man ended up walking behind us in the subway station ( i noticed ) and went on the train we went on (southbound) and my friend noticed that he came closer to us so my friend baited us leaving and seeing if he would follow us, and he did. We quickly went back into the closing doors and I saw he went on the other train, meaning he only went on our train because he was following us. 

I’m sorry for how long this is I just didn’t wanna leave out any details. 

I been feeling really nervous and scared to leave my house and see him again or even visit that pub again. and in general I keep reliving that time in my head and feeling like shit about it. the night was so extremely amazing till that happened and I can’t even sit in the happiness of what happened beforehand. I remember I was just sitting on the train crying on and off and regretting taking my phone out and even leaving my house. I also freeze in situations like this, I’m glad my friend was really on the ball with everything (she’s more fight) but still I just am still shaken over it and I’m scared i’ll see him again and if I’m alone and he might provoke me or something. 

so any advice, words, anything would be so nice thank you",advice/tips on an incident that happened last night

2022-11-20 12:12:23,Anxiety,"This is also sort of a vent .

I’m a college student and overall it’s been a huge adaptation for my social behavior. Especially with being on a sports team.

I’ve posted about it before, but i’m dwelling on it a bit more, especially since more recent events.

This past week has just been hectic, and i’m drained between physical health and school work/ exams. Having to go to practice and be around this teammate in general has especially been difficult.

He’s been why my anxiety has sky rocketed. Just the “affection” bomb and overwhelming presence he is just too much right now and before.

It’s gotten to a point where i’m starting to “break” so to say. I hate how his actions overwhelm me to such a high degree.

Yesterday I was at practice, we were maxing out fr bench, and I wasn’t doing well. I was frustrated, and taking a break. He decides to come up and hug me, he does this with a lot of teammates who he’s closer with. Due to past shot, I don’t like this type contact/ or anything like that, especially when I’m already emotionally exhausted.

I freaked out and panicked, and just felt a swell of anxiety. He’s done stuff like this before so i’m always on edge. I ended up elbowing him and told him to stop. He just backed off at that point and didn’t try to talk with me for the rest of the day, seemed quite cold.

I left practice early. He then proceeds to message me last night, saying he “doesn’t know why I act the way I do but hopes I can talk to him about it”.

I have told him to not do stuff like this, I thought I gave enough signs that I am not comfortable, but I hate feeling like my only way to get my point across is by hostility. Because that’s the only way he’s actually not.

It makes me look like an ass hole because everyone likes him, but i don’t know why i had to go to an extreme in order to get him to stop, I just feel like shit all the time.
It has happened before in different cases, but it’s still frustrating. I have to be around him a lot, but it’s too much for me a lot.

Thank you for reading.",It’s frustrating when your anxiety can present as hostility to others especially when it’s not intended.
2022-11-20 11:55:39,Anxiety,"I’ve noticed this becoming a pattern and wondering if anyone else here can help me understand why. I’m very quick to anger and get defensive against my partner when he says something I deem “stupid”. And I spiral QUICK. 

Eg. Says confidently a building is named &lt;whatever&gt; but I know it’s not. Then I go on a rant berating him that he said that so matter of fact.

I find it’s mostly the “inaccurate but stated as fact” comments that trigger me: “That line up is for a slipknot concert” / “that’s a graveyard over there” / “prenups are thrown out by courts after 5 years anyways”.  

It makes my blood boil and I find myself attacking and telling him how he SHOULD have phrased his comment or to not guess without context if he wasn’t 100% certain.

I certainly don’t think I’m right all the time, and I’m very careful to qualify sentences I say - maybe too much.

2022-11-20 11:24:21,Anxiety,"I've been suffering from panic attacks and anxiety since I was 14 - I'm now 32. I had my first ulcer when I was 14 and that's when I was diagnosed with anxiety. When I was around anywhere between 24-26 (I can't quite recall), I started taking Ativan and it helped dramatically. I took 1 mg per day and it was typically 30 minutes before dinner because my anxiety as well as nausea associated with the anxiety picks up in the nights. I stopped taking it in 2019 and haven't taken it since and have been really proud of myself that I have been able to manage without it. However, when my son was born, I got hit really badly by postpartum anxiety (PPA) and it's gotten a bit better, but I don't feel fully like myself .

I'm now getting nauseous every night, my ibs is flaring up like a mofo, which is probably not helping my nausea. I'm finding it hard to eat food. I'm nervous all the time - and it's just about stupid shit. I'm also extremely introverted, so any social interaction for me, specifically right now, makes me really uncomfortable and I'll start getting stomach issues. The last time we went over to our friend's house for dinner, I ended up blowing up their toilet 5 separate times. Eating out in public has always been an issue for me - I hate it - I always end up picking at my food rather than eating it. This is getting out of control. 

I really don't want to be put back on medication because I've been off of it for so long. For those that have tried therapy, has it worked? Do they all try to push medication? I guess I'm just looking for solidarity and advice - specifically for those of you that struggle with nauseousness when your anxiety is heightened.",I am so sick and tired of dealing with my anxiety

2022-11-20 10:31:55,Anxiety,"So I had a physical in February and my Doctor asked me a few mental health related questions, “do you have trouble motivating, are you worried often etc…”. I answered honestly and told her I force myself to load up on caffeine because I’m worried I won’t preform at work, and I drink myself to sleep to make sure I get adequate sleep because I worry I won’t be able to get 8 hours. I told her I get infrequent panic attacks, when having conversations with people I need to make a good impression with my neck gets stiff and I get shaky, or when confronting someone my vision gets narrowed and I get shaky. She told me I might have anxiety, but I really didn’t feel like it was severe enough to get therapy or medication, which was her recommendation. 


Normally the majority of my day I’m confident in what I’m doing, I don’t get nervous or second guess myself. I have noticed lately I’m becoming nervous when preforming my job functions, delaying going to bed or getting ready for work, and delaying going home after work because I don’t want to leave the familiarity with what I’m doing at that moment.

2022-11-20 06:58:10,Anxiety,"I’m curious if anyone else here experiences this.

I have anxiety, I have had DPDR, and both are always triggered primarily by lack of sleep for me. 
But I’ve noticed that when Im a little sleep deprived, or I’m not getting proper sleep for a few nights, I can some times have this strange occurs me, where it feels like my mind and body have sort of… fallen asleep at different speeds? Idk how to really describe it beyond that, but it leads me to waking up disoriented, or feeling like I’m still dreaming, when I’m not. 
Usually it causes a panic attack, but I just took a nap, and due to my best friend’s cough keeping me up last night (and during the nap) I noticed I was experiencing it, but didn’t freak out. 
It does kind of lowkey feel like I haven’t woken up yet though. 

Does anyone else deal with it?

2022-11-20 06:52:46,Anxiety,"I'm in my late 20s and have had attacks for nearly 20 years. I have excellent anti-anxiety habits (diet, exercise, attitude, etc.).

They used to be more like your typical panic attack, fast heart, nausea, sweat and a feeling of I need to leave this situation now, although there has never been a feeling of ""I am dying"". I used to have a list of possible triggers, though they seem to be random.

However, in August 2020, I randomly had an attack that I now call 'mega attacks'. These are much stronger than the old attacks, last longer and seemingly have no cure for them.

My problem with attacks has always been nausea. With the old attacks I would feel other symptoms too like racing heart and jitters, though nausea was the main concern.

With these new attacks though, my heart doesn't race at all. The nausea gets so bad that I feel that I can't move. This nausea then follows an hour long pattern of rising and falling with severe peaks that leave me unable to move - it disables me, like shutting down a robot or something. It then eventually goes down, albeit much slower than before and leaving me close to tears. 

I typically have a large array or remedies and techniques that can ease an attack or provide temporary relief. These include medical remedies such as Clonazepam, Propranolol, Buspirone (daily medication), CBD + THC and more recently Dramamine. (I should point out that I don't take these all together because obviously that would be dangerous.)  Then for non-medical remedies I have deep breathing, reassurance, wiggling my toes quickly, doing multiplication in my head, naming things I can see etc. and the final option of briefly leaving the situation. 

What stuns and concerns me is that NONE of these help stop or ease these new mega attacks. It takes over and says ""na man I'm in charge now"". What floors me even more is I would say with some confidence that typically the most helpful and preached technique - deep breathing - **makes it feel worse!**

This all come to a head when I recently traveled overseas and I had one of these attacks that was so bad it lasted for 20 hours, and I despairingly couldn't get on our final flight as I was rooted to my seat in the terminal. I was incredibly embarrassed (although didn't beat myself up as I am compassionate towards myself) as we had to go to the hotel and come back the next day, and even then it wasn't much better. It then followed me for the next week before finally settling and then occasionally rearing its ugly head. (I should point out that I like planes and travel doesn't bother me at all.)

This is the worst I have felt as an adult and it ruined what was, on paper, a great trip - I couldn't enjoy the sights, sounds and flavours because of how bad I felt most of the time.

Again, **I must stress that when these mega attacks occur, it is only the nausea**. There is no sweating, heart racing, feelings of dying etc. Traditional medical and non-medical remedies don't even scratch the surface. These events are random with no obvious triggers and render me into nothing more than an immovable blob of nausea.

I don't get it, why is it like this? What do I do about this? No one seems to get it and doctors don't seem to know either. I repeatedly get told 'hang in there, keep breathing' etc. though that's not helpful and it annoys me. These attacks make me suicidal. I hate them and I don't get it.",Please read - what are these these unusual 'mega panic attacks' and how can I stop them?

I'm 31 and male. I was in the military but it's been almost ten years. I have a job that doesn't pay me great, but I really enjoy it and my coworkers. I rent and can afford it without much drama. I have an amazing girlfriend of five years working her way through vet school and she's killing it. My life for all intents and purposes is very, very enjoyable. 

I have issues. Secrets. Things we all do. Like a lot of us I pushed down a lot of the things I didn't want to really deal with and just pretended like it would be fine. Debt. Teeth. 

It's not worth it in my case, but I will not speak for any of you because all of our situations are different. I only have 4.5k in debt. That sucks, but so so many people have so much worse. Yeah, the teeth bit kinda sucks but they aren't scary or rotten and I'm hoping on marrying a vet. 

I guess the point of this rambling other than to help with the black hole in my gut is to just say that this stuff can sneak up and body slam you. You can tell yourself you're fine or it's fine or it'll be fine, but I strongly urge anyone who has the means to take action to do it.

The number of options and routes to take in life scare me instead of exciting me. I have just been offered a pretty good promotion at work which I have worked really hard for, yet two weeks ago I was set on moving to another country to start afresh - or at least give living abroad a go. It's like my brain wants to be spontaneous but my sensible side holds me back. I don't want to regret what I choose not to do, but I also don't want to regret pursuing current opportunities e.g. the promotion. 

I have recently come out of a 3-year relationship and I can't see myself wanting to be in one again for quite a while, or feeling the urge to get married or have children, which makes me feel like an anomaly.

I’m stuck, and i’m so tired of it. I want to be healthy so bad.

I saw a doctor a few weeks ago, got an ekg and blood done. They said my heart is fine. Noted POTS, and sent me on my way. I went to my psychiatrist and she prescribed me Buspirone and lexapro, after my last med, Celexa stopped working. I’m on my second day of lexapro and i don’t feel great.

My anxiety is revolving around my heart, it always has been. I get it checked but i always think they missed something. I don’t have insurance so i can’t really go to a cardiologist. But my GP says i’m fine and thinks i shouldn’t worry.

I get chest pains that i tell myself is heartburn but idk what it really is. Maybe it’s my lungs, i have a band nicotine problem. I just don’t know. Today has been particularly bad. My abdomen is so tight from stress. I have no idea what to do. Everything sucks ass.

Warning: TRIGGER ⚠️ SELF HARM ⚠️ arguing ⚠️


Short story been with partner of 8 years he lives with me and family and was my 1st trigger. Currently have major trust issues from cheating basically every year. He does self harm and I guess has a bit of anxiety/ bipolar disorder he is in meds for. My therapist left and I never got a new one . My partner and I get into arguments where he throws shit in my face and I cannot cope with what he has done but yet he still wants to be together and I still love him . Being away causes anxiety and when we argue and I feel a build up I let him know but he doesn't stop. In turn it gets to a point where he will say "" calm down or I will leave, stop it  your doing this to yourself and it's all in your head"" his reaction to my freak out is during an attack is self harming or triggering me more. Today I was having trust issues about his phone we argue about breaking up and he says fine but then says no I want you I love you I'm on meds trying for you I don't want us to end. The trust issues are too much and I'm anxious away from him. My anxiety has started into self harm head banging to calm me or hard head banging out of reacting to his threats because honestly wherever I go I just don't feel safe with family friends ...no one. He went to work after we argued and I had an epic meltdown lied to my job bc I didn't know how to tell them I'm losing it. Last time I was actually sick they said to come in and I couldn't. He went to work and swore he would be back to talk me down out  it's been an hour nothing calms me down. Nothing helps, nothing relaxes me and half the time my family threatens the ER where our pych nurses say your never getting out and taunt you and if cry or feel nervous threaten you with medication...

I keep thinking about when I was younger, and they were too, and I feel so sad for them that their life has passed by but I still have so much time left. I am so scared for them to die.

The best way I can explain how I am feeling is this dread of presenting something in front of the class. You agonize over it for days until it happens (much like anticipating death, whether it is our death or the death of others) and then that presentation comes and it's over before you know it.

I can't stop thinking how life is nothing but a series of moments. We keep thinking about the future as if the future is something real, but it isn't. There is no future. There is now. A minute or so ago I was contemplating writing this post, and now I am several paragraphs in. There is only now.

I just can't stop thinking about how my death will become now very soon, as will the death of everyone I love, and how everything is just approaching its end faster than we can come to grips with it.

My downfall began in 2011, when i got hit by ""bad thoughts"" as i called it, just a month before my 11th bday. From then on I had ups and downs. Mostly ups but I did experience many downs too. However nothing compared to what I experienced last year. Last year I was in so much pain, that even tjinking about it makes me wanna burst into tears. I wanted to be unalive but I didn't do anything. I got help last year after living in my bed for about 3.5 months. During that time, my OCD got so bad. False memories, real event OCD, heck even morality OCD was a pain in the brain(lol). I got to the internet for reassurance. For all those with OCD, you know how bad of an idea that was. I had immense guilt for masturbation too and for alot of things related to it so I would make posts and talk to strangers asking them if this was normal, if that was normal etc. Now i usually made sure with the age of ppl. Like I'd ask them and text. However once i didnt ask and I remember seeing some posts of them being a nurse so I assumed they were above 18. However i saw this after i spoke w them. So I'm now worried that what if they were actually 18 instead. What would happen then. Plus while typing stuff i would go into a lot of details and would basically write v explicitly. Idk why but i think i thought that was important. However a few times as i typed the stuff I'd feel turned on. Im scared tht i got sexual gratification from that. Lastly, this therapist/psychology student person helped me on reddit. But when i got so so bad and ADDICTED to reassurance, Id text them multiple times a day without consent w my NSFW actions and thoughts. Confessing that stuff to them. I felt guilty about doing that so now, after a year, i texted and apologied. But i feel like i ab*sed them idk.what do y'all think.",i could really use some insight. how messed up is this?

2022-11-19 12:59:04,Anxiety,"My mom is habitually very good about answering the phone, which doesn’t exactly help my anxiety on the odd occasion that she doesn’t answer. When she doesn’t answer the phone, i get overwhelmed with feelings that something has happened to her and am essentially paralyzed to do anything else until she answers. I don’t know how to deal with this anymore. 

It also stems from worrying about my mother’s health in general. Although she hasn’t been diagnosed with anything, she is 55 years old and overweight and very stress prone. She also has a strong aversion to getting check ups and has heavy sleep apnea which worries me so much. I think about it at least 3 to 4 times a week and become incredibly anxious and frustrated that i have no control over things and can’t observe what’s going on with her health at all.

2022-11-19 12:51:20,Anxiety,"I've made an effort to be more social and, more importantly, being myself. Before, I would be a huge pushover devoting myself to people who never appreciated or noticed me. I would also hide my true feelings, allowing myself to get taken advantage of. I also got stuck putting on a facade of politeness simply because of how long I kept it going and because that's just what people expected me to be. But in the past few years, I've been forced out of my comfort zone (for better or for worse) but it has made me learn more about myself and even improved my sociability.

All my life I have been branded as ""shy,"" but I feel good saying that I am more open with and more willing to talk to new people. I am still learning, though, and I am definitely more socially clumsy than the average person, but at least I'm social! Which is more than I could say for myself a few years ago.

However, being more social is still scary because it leads to more opportunities for me to mess up in front of people. As such, I feel like I have worse self-esteem than before. This isn't what I expected when I started getting out of my shell. I worry that my true self is worse than being fake. I admit that I'm more combative given my refusal to being taken advantage of and hiding my true feelings ever again. Like, I will not say something's ""okay"" when it isn't for the sake of politeness anymore. But now I worry that I've made things worse. Me being as anxious as I am, I always worry that I come off as rude, dismissive, or judgmental in some cases. This is truly not my intention. I can tell that I come off really uptight thanks to my anxiety. But I really do care for people. I just run out patience the moment I sense that it's not reciprocated.

I know that I'm not as charismatic or insanely nice as my coworkers, I just try to set my boundaries. I also value open communication and honesty, which is what really drives me at work. This doesn't mean that I have no filter. I can read the room. I'll just tell it to you straight if you ask for an honest answer from me. Ultimately, I treat people the way I want to be treated.

Maybe I am a jerk and I deserve to be depressed over it. I hate myself more than I hate anyone else (cliche, I know), so that might have something to do with it. I don't want to excuse myself with a sob story. I do wish I was just born more chill, and nice, and charismatic, and confident. I wish I could be one of those people that everyone loves instantly. Why do I have to be such garbage? I suck so much that I even suck at myself.",I feel like my attempts to get better are making things worse
2022-11-19 12:38:08,Anxiety,"Was sort of inspired by another post and wanted to vent a bit but I don’t do well with sudden changes especially with less than 24 hours notice. (Apologies in advance for this long one but TLDR sudden changes at work sending me back into spiralling thoughts)

Yesterday, my manager at work announced big boss wants us back in the office full time starting next Monday. (We were hybrid mode) I don’t know if I showed it on my face but internally it felt like being drenched in ice water and my mind just going overdrive full of panicky thoughts switching from “omg wtf” to “how am I gonna wake up at 5 am five times in a row” to “I need to meal prep and cut my budget” on top of my usual 50+ daily swirling thoughts. 

This was the second time this bomb was suddenly dropped on us when we were supposed to return full time from WFH 6 months ago, only for that to change to hybrid a week after we returned to the office. (It was delayed by a few weeks because we didn’t even have equipment or an office ready to move back in but that’s another story) I just don’t know how to deal with this whiplash of events and emotions. I guess another sudden announcement today was I was expected to work on new tasks that are the opposite of my skill sets I was initially hired on to do. 

I would consider myself as someone who’s adaptable, love to learn new things and usually open to change (within reason) but my anxiety has been going overdrive since last night from trying to rearrange my appointments to changing my commute route (yay 3 hour commutes) to frantically looking at job posts and trying to budget/penny-pinch on what I need for meal prep/new bus pass etc.

I thought I was alright after putting in time and work with my counsellor the last 1.5 years with the tools and exercises given but it just felt like progress has been stunted again with this all happening. (Although it’s part of our work benefits, now I feel less secure with having to excuse myself from work to attend in-person appointments with the counsellor)

I know in maybe 2-3 weeks I should be okay after adjusting to this sudden change but at the same time I want to just shut down, quit immediately and not work anymore. I know that’s not a smart idea especially in an anxiety-inducing economic landscape we’re currently in but sometimes I just don’t want to do anything anymore. If only money wasn’t an issue I’d rather just disconnect and not leave my room for a few months lol

For now I’ve been pretty emotionally detached from work (not going beyond expectations, light, shallow conversations with coworkers etc) and spending my weekends either by myself or with friends and I already feel bad for venting to my close friends about my work situation. I know this attitude/behaviour isn’t sustainable in the long-term but ahhhh I don’t know :(",I hate sudden and unexpected changes

2022-11-19 12:26:14,Anxiety,"Hello,

I'm going to start simply. I am a 15 year old boy, I go to a American highschool. That's all you need to know.

Recently I have been feeling alone, I've always kind of liked being alone but for some reason it's changed and I feel lonely all the time. I have friends but only one true friend I talk to regularly. He and I are so different, he's a jock and makes friends everywhere he goes, I'm a loner.

I can't make new friends because I'm so paranoid people will end up hating me or think I'm annoying or weird. The fact I'm not very good looking doesn't help either. At the beginning of this year I made friends with some people in one of my table groups and they even talked about wanting to maybe play some games together sometime without me initiating it. I felt so great, finally new friends. I joined their party when they asked and we talked for a bit. This happened for a few days but a few weeks later they don't like me much anymore. I don't know why and it hurts. It's just reinforcing the thoughts nobody likes me. 

I'm to anxious to talk to people and too depressed to do anything with my few friends. A few weeks ago my friends invited me out for Halloween and I was to anxious to go. These are my closest friends and I can't even do stuff with them. Let alone talk to a girl which takes me to my main issue. A few years back I had a girl. We were never official but we were together. I remember watched stuff with this girl. Holding her in my arms and talking to her. These memories have been eating at me for so long, I want that back. I just want to feel like I did then, Loved and wanted. I don't want to be alone.

I have no hope for any new friends or something more. I'm not good looking, I can't talk to people, when I do talk to them I mess it up. I don't know why but whenever I do I end up doing something annoying or being a dick and I hate it. I haven't always been like this I just don't know how to act around other people anymore. In lockdown i cut myself off from all my friends and never recovered. Now after I emerged all I got was crippling anxiety.

I’m coming up on needing to gear up for my return to my program. Only thing is I’ve realized is that I have absolutely no desire to back in that environment again. I’m not sure what is it but I experience such intense anxiety around the whole concept of it and it’s really defined by whole experience with it. I experience intrusive thoughts and uncontrollable panic on the regular. It’s been impossible for me to shake this or to learn to manage it - I’ve tried therapy, meditation, medication etc.

My parents always ask me if I feel regret when I see that she’s still moving towards getting her degree and I’m like honestly not at all, which I think confuses them.

I’ve been so stressed with work and also feeling so trapped with the symptoms from the withdrawals. I’m scared and alone too. And friends don’t understand. 

But the panic and fear comes out of nowhere. I’m exhausted with anxiety and fear when the shaking and burning starts. I already have health  anxiety. 

My body shaking is almost like a seizure, so much shaking; especially my legs. I feel like a freak. Then I start having difficulty breathing because I panic more.

2022-11-19 10:43:57,Anxiety,"FOMO - Fear of missing out. 

When I was younger and my mom went out to social gatherings/parties, I would get this awful anxiety that she would die, that she didn’t love me because she was leaving me, and that I was missing out on having fun like she was having. It got better as I got older, and she also stopped going to such things and as such I didn’t have the same chances to worry. She says she doesn’t like going to such events, I figure half because social gatherings of relative strangers aren’t her thing, and also because she knew I was worried sick at home. 

Jump forward to today and I’m in a relationship with the girl I love, and as an unfortunate consequence, I’ve rediscovered my old childhood anxiety. Tonight as I write this, she’s out at her friend’s party on the other side of town and I’ve got the same anxiety as I had all those years ago. I worry firstly that I’m missing out on the fun she’s having/the fun I would have with her, I’m worrying about her safety given such parties contain alcohol, and worst of all, I worry just slightly about how much she loves me if she’s so busy doing other things. The last concern is absolutely unreasonable, unhealthy, and generally awful, and it’s the part that bothers me the most exactly because it’s so unhealthy to a relationship. 

I don’t want to feel this way when she goes out, but the problem is that I don’t choose to feel this way. I just get the feeling and the thoughts that follow with it.

2022-11-19 10:19:14,Anxiety,"Hi everyone! I just found this subreddit and thought I’d make a little post about this as I’m super excited to move back to my home state.

I always had a good amount of anxiety, but didn’t get diagnosed for it until early 2020 (along with depression and ADHD). After the pandemic, my anxiety skyrocketed and I thought that leaving my home state would help me manage it. Low and behold, moving away from all your friends and family made it exponentially worse. In the year I’ve been halfway across the country, I’ve left my apartment 3 times outside of work to socialize, and it was hell. Every minute was hell. I like my friends here, but I hate it here.

When the time came, I decided I needed to move back to my home state and I could not be happier already with my decision. I’ll be a three hour drive from my family instead of a three hour flight, I’ll be back with my friends who I genuinely look forward to hanging out with, the city I’m living in is amazing, and I still get to work in the area I worked in before.

I don’t dread the idea of making plans with my friends. I don’t have the horrible anxiety of wondering what I would do if something happened to my loved ones and I couldn’t get there in time. I don’t recoil at the thought of leaving my apartment. I already have 3 concert events planned for when I get back.

My school work is improving as well and I’ve found a therapist I think I’ll really connect with. I’m also hoping to get medication to better manage my anxiety from getting out of hand again.

Sorry for the ramble, I’m just very excited to get my life back again :)","My anxiety got worse when I left home, now that I’m going back I’m making plans to go out again!"

Anytime I go to sit down to study, I feel like I’m too stupid and quit. I’m afraid of failure and avoid it at all costs. I feel like a fraud because I am a fraud.

And then when I get anxious, I am so hyper focused on that anxiety that it clouds any ability to focus. So I’m afraid that even when I sit down to study, it won’t sink in and I’ll fail anyway.

I’m tired of being a self-fulfilling prophecy. I’m in my 30s, and I can’t keep doing this. I *know* what I have to do, but I just can’t bring myself to do it and I feel insane.

I've had 3 anxiety attacks in the last 15 days.  Like many of you, I went to the ER because of heart palpitations and feelings of an impending heart attack.  It was an awful feeling and I never experienced anything like that in my life.  Doctors released me within a few hours and said I was fine.  This has happened 3x and it sucks.  
        I never got clear advice on what to do next.  They gave me a diagnose of ""heart palpitations "" and follow these instructions.  Yoga, medidate, breathing exercises one ER visit said follow-up with a cardiologist.  My folks told me you have anxiety and should get medicine and that's what I did.  I was prescribed some anti-anxiety medication and held off from taking them until today.  I was at work and enjoyed a nice walk in my break when I noticed my heart rate was up and boom anxiety attack!  I took Hydroxcizne or something like that and ended up leaving home.

2022-11-19 09:50:27,Anxiety,"Trigger warning: emetophobia 

For context, my anxiety is much more physical than it is mental. I do get very intrusive and anxious thoughts and am very prone to rumination, but the physical symptoms (constant shakiness, nausea, feeling weak, unable to eat for days at a time cause thinking about anything makes my stomach hurt—etc) outweigh most of the mental symptoms

Anyway—my biggest concern is that recently I’ve been having nights where I can’t sleep at all because of ruminating thoughts, which makes me feel horribly nauseous and unable to sleep without throwing up for hours. When I do get “sleep” I’m not fully asleep, I get these weird half-awake visions and I shake and shake all over my body. It’s awful, and in the morning I feel just as nauseous and twice as tired, and when I have periods of particularly bad anxiety it gets to the point I hardly get any sleep at all. 

So far none of the things I’ve tried to stop this have worked. I don’t have access to a therapist and the people I can talk to about it don’t believe it affects me as badly as it does. Does anyone have any advice? I really just want a good nights sleep for once :(",Need advice for getting proper sleep

It's just really bizarre, because on the one hand, I have overcome so many obstacles these recent years that I still find it hard to not be proud of my achievements. Those achievements however, were mainly materialistic. I guess I was naive to believe that all that grinding would make others see me as more approachable or attractive.

It has gotten to a point where I feel so disconnected from the entire world. I feel as if I don't belong anywhere. I will go to parties, drink, dance and meet new people, but building lasting relationships is both difficult and tiring. I never skip school or work, but in these recent years I haven't taken it as serious as I used to. I suppose I just figured out that there were more important things in life.

I have tried a lot of different hobbies and such. I played soccer for a few years, swam, joined an organisation, played video games with a lot of people, switched schools and switched jobs.

I feel as if I gave all those things valid attempts, but when I go out and spend time with people, it feels really bad. I will then go home and at first, I will feel safe and secure, but slowly and surely, the loneliness always returns, and then I see myself trying something new or some different approach to being social, and thus my cycle of pain keeps repeating itself.

Some might say that my main problem is my analytical approach to social interactions and life as a whole. I understand that point of view, however even when try to be myself, and try shut off my stupid overly active brain, or whatever, I still see myself feeling stuck in life and relationships. 

Am I supposed so surrender myself hedonism? Will chasing more easy hook-ups, drugs or more alcohol make me happy? My intuition tells me no but my hopelessness and lack of better answers keep telling me otherwise.

I should probably specify, I'm talking about breathing awareness. Developed that from a misguided theory and attempt to prevent myself from swallowing air or overbreathing becuase I had/have GI issues (didn't work, of course). 

But ever since I've become aware of the usually unconscious act of breathing, and it's pretty annoying. 

I've had anxiety for years, interspersed by bouts of depression. But this does feel more like OCD. Especially in the beginning of my anxiety, I've pretty much felt every waking heartbeat for more than a year, and every single one was too fast and the sign of heart attack, etc. - so there was a great deal of anxiety and panic attached to the whole sensation. 

With the breathing, I don't necessarily feel threatened by the sensation or think it's a sign of something portentous, but it's a constant awareness, and at that quite taxing - it overshadows other tasks/occupations, I often can't quite focus on reading because my attention is half directed to the rise and fall of my belly (because I've also become pretty obsessive about belly breathing instead of chest breathing - that's why most of the anxiety techniques aren't much use to me, because conscious breathing/breathing techniques aren't relaxing to me at all :)  ).",Sensorimotor OCD/Anxiety

2022-11-18 15:41:41,Anxiety,"I hope to one day forgive myself one day over this ""camgirl"" scam I fell for in July of 2021 and it feels like I can't, I constantly obsess and worry over it all the time now and it plagues my mind because I feel like I did something wrong, it's a burden on my shoulders because of how dumb and naive I was when trying tinder for the first time last summer and a profile matched with me with only two pictures and a snapchat on it. I didn't know what it meant and I stupidly added them on snapchat. They spammed me with a link saying they couldn't message me on snapchat and that the only way they could was on their ""camsite"" link. This was a bot I was talking to the entire time and I unfortunately didn't realize it because I was so stupid last summer. When I clicked on their website out of curiosity, it asked for cc info and I thought it was actually required to talk to them. I didn't give them no cc info though, I instead entered in the last 10$ on a visa gift card because it was supposedly only 10$ to talk to them on their which I now know was a fake website. They tried to sign me up for an endless subscription on their fake dating website, but I instantly deleted the account that was already made for me on it the minute it was made and got out of it.

I feel I made an awful mistake by even being on tinder in the first place and clicking on the link in the first place just makes it worse. I don't want to mess up my loved ones life because of how stupid I was, I'm only 23 living in the US and this always hurts me more thinking of how my stupidity could impact those around me who I love the most.

I'm no longer on dating apps nowadays and I'm no longer on snapchat, but the fact is because I stupidly fell for this scam when I was clueless. I don't know where my boundaries went last summer either.

Some of my healthy boundaries that I'm trying to self-improve on now and that should have never left me are :

1. **Never adding a stranger on social media who I don't know**
2. **Never clicking on links from people I don't know**
3. **Never swiping right on a tinder profile that's unverified and with only two pictures and a snapchat on it**
4. **Never giving out personal info to strangers like email, social media or phone number again**
5. **Never accepting random requests on social media from those I don't personally know**
6. **Using my brain more because I have a brain for a reason and I must use it**",How can I ever forgive myself over this scam I fell for in July of 2021?

I have a headache and I immediately think it's a brain tumor. I feel any pain or any discomfort imaginable, I will literally always somehow attribute it to cancer or some illness, even when there's absolutely zero reason for it to be an illness 

I constantly live between wanting to get better and live and wanting to just kill myself. I made the worst mistake of my life googling my symptoms a year ago and ever since then I never felt happy and calm once. 

Imagine living every single day, either worrying sick or doing everything to ignore your worries. And whenever you feel a little bit happy or positive, you just get that grim reminder that you can't be happy. Like it's not right. And if it somehow happens that I'm enjoying the day, my brain just goes ""yeah but what if you have cancer?"" and completely ruins that tiny bit of happiness I had in that moment

This shit is so debilitating and I'm at the point where I seriously consider suicide. This is literally a curse and it just makes it even worse knowing I will probably never go back to being normal again, it will never be the same.

Today, at school (grad student) I sat at the lounge area. I usually sit there with 3 to 5 classmates. I came and two of the females (sarah and Britannie) of the group were there. I said hi and they kinda ignored me. I went to the bathroom and came back. S and B were asking me how I was doing driving. Telling me they drive crazy like super fast and I go the speed limit because I’ve already hit a car. Almost caused me to have a panic attack. They were kinda saying oh wow you can’t drive yet. 

I was like rather not go on the highway until I feel safe. Then they were taking about the symbols on the dashboard. One with an arrow within the car. B said oh the turning car button as a joke. I was exhausted and confused. Said I knew what’s taking about. S kinda said oh what does it mean ? Making me feel like an idiot. Sarah and brittannie laugh which made me angry.

Literally when the rest of the group came, I left few after. Unfortunately I was not ok. My anxiety made me start picking my nails. I was upset. After class liz asked if i was ok but i said yeah just tired and want to go home. My hair is falling out, i have a bald patch.

2022-11-18 14:00:24,Anxiety,"I think the first step, if you’re looking for happiness, is to ask yourself what happiness actually is. Is it just a feeling or something more? 

For me, [happiness is an ongoing process](https://jrsunny.com/is-happiness-a-decision-or-an-emotion/) of being present and staying in the moment. But it’s not enough to just be present and in the moment. You also have to be doing things that make you happy.

The question is: what makes you happy? Sometimes we fool ourselves into thinking that the things that made us happy when we were kids make us happy now. And sometimes those things still do make us happy, but not always.

I love being creative and making things, being active, doing good in the world, learning new things, [**finding happiness**](https://jrsunny.com/best-ways-to-find-inner-peace/) through service to others, and spending time with people who love me. 

And maybe you feel like what made you happy in the past isn’t good enough now. Maybe you’re worried that your life isn’t exciting enough and you need some kind of spark or drama to be happy. If that’s true, don’t worry – because, trust me, life gets more exciting. 

Plus, the best way to stay grounded and focused on what makes you happy (or at least content) is to keep your life simple. 

This year I’ve been working on simplifying my life as much as possible and there’s no doubt in my mind that it has made me a lot happier.

On the other hand, choice is not just for gift-givers at birthday parties. Choice is power. It is freedom.

2022-11-18 12:36:17,Anxiety,"I was hit by a car in February. I was crossing the street and the entire surrounding area was empty. As I was in the middle of crossing this car came out of nowhere from the direction up ahead. 

He turned in and slowly drove up to me so close his car was touching the side of my leg and for a split second I froze because this startled me...

And then he hit the gas.

He drove right through me and hit me so quick my eyes never closed. I watched my own body fold over itself as I went up over the hood and hit the windshield before landing a few feet away on the side of the street. 

All I remember while I was being hit was, ""how could you?"" It was a man behind the wheel. I'm a female, 29 hardly over a hundred pounds tbh. It's really a miracle that not only did I survive this impact, I actually came out of it virtually untouched. 

Nothing was broken, fractured or genuinely messed up. I would later realize I had two large contusions on each knee and my shoulder was in big pain for like two days. Other than that, nothing. All of that healed up within a week. 

Police said there was nothing they could do despite camera footage because I didn't get the license plate. I was hit from the side. 

I didn't go to the hospital either. I know that sounds weird but I'd never been through that before, have someone intentionally try to take my life. all I wanted was my mom. 

I was able to walk myself home.
She helped take care of me over the next couple of weeks. 

I was so depressed and now anxious about dying, and about my mom (who actually is sick and is also all I have left in this world) dying and leaving me behind. In fact, her dying was more of a thought after the hit and run than my own possible death.

All of a sudden 
All I ate was ice cream and lay in bed healing. About a month later, I started developing breathing problems that have plagued me ever since. It'll stop then start again.

I'd been so scared about dying because it'll feel like not only am I short of breath but it was like something was sitting on my upper chest and as if I was breathing through plastic, my nose will momentarily get very stuffy making it all worse. 

Then it'll feel like it's hard to take in air, almost as if I'm breathing manually. I've been to the hospital 3x, urgent care 5x and the doctor's office 3x. 

I've had x rays of my chest, tests done on my lungs, kidneys, liver, they've taken blood and even referred me to an allergy specialist. There were so many avenues taken to see whats been going on and the specialist believes its acid reflux and anciety. The hospital diagnosed me with anxiety as well. 

They checked me for asthma, because my symptoms were mimicking asthma except there was no wheezing at all and usually once I calmed down or started talking about whatever was stressing me (usually the crash) every symptom I was suffering from st the moment would just evaporate. 

Thankfully, I came up negative.For that and all other breathing/pulmonary issues. As well as negative for COVID too. 

The point is I've been checked all the way out and found it hard to believe it was anxiety because usually it just makes me short of breath.

But now even my anxiety symptoms have changed. I didn't know how to admit this to myself because I've never been here, in this place of life, before. But every single thing came up negative and my body was showing up clear.

I've been given asthma pumps at first and a nebulizer during one ER trip, as well as Prednisone. It didn't work for me. None of them. All that worked was crying and I guess getting it all out and then..  


I'm sorry, I really don't know why I'm posting all this, maybe because I haven't gone to therapy. I got a referral and I'm still looking because I genuinely want to make sure I get it right because my first and only attempt at therapy ended in sexual harassment. 

The point is... Something happened to me. And I'm lonely, and I'm hurting really bad inside. And I didn't know anxiety could have this great of an effect on my ability to breathe. 

I guess the stress of the impact flared up my gerd and what isn't helping is the fact that I hardlt leave the house and usually lay in bed all day, I work on Medium too so I'm usually overworking. 

I want to live my life again. 

I want to be active again. I want to travel  I want to go outside again but I'm scared of dying before I can get back home. Sometimes I've left the house and suddenly my breathing felt congested and slowed, as well as if I couldn't get enough air in. Every step, every block further from home it would get worse and worse until I thought I was gonna die. Once I'd turn back, the symptoms would resolve more and more, with each block closer to my apartment building.



 These people are driving insanely dangerously lately. I've almost been hit a few times since just going across the street to run necessary errands, by people running lights.

The world isn't what it was just a couple years ago and even then it was off. So now it just feels like a terrible.. trap we're all stuck in. 

There was something haunting about the fact that I was so close to my home, my sanctuary, and could have potentially never made it. 
 
I feel guilty that I almost left my mom here alone. I didn't have my phone on me that day.. and I didn't tell her I was leaving. All I can think about is the cops going to our door and telling her I was dead and her telling them they must be mistaken,

Only to go to my room and find it empty. 

I'm looking into therapy and support groups but I'm also slowly trying to adjust to not only having to cons I'm me a new diet... But adjusting to this new life with PTSD. And the new understanding that at any given moment humans can decide to take our lives like it's nothing. 

It's an unsettling reality that our lives really are in the hands of others, whether we want it to be or not. I know this was long and I'm sorry. Just...
Thank you for listening to me.",he drove his car right through me

I want to be active again. I want to travel  I want to go outside again but I'm scared of dying before I can get back home. Sometimes I've left the house and suddenly my breathing felt congested and slowed, as well as if I couldn't get enough air in. Every step, every block further from home it would get worse and worse until I thought I was gonna die. Once I'd turn back, the symptoms would resolve more and more, with each block closer to my apartment building.

I've almost been hit a few times since just going across the street to run necessary errands, by people running lights.

People are driving more insanely than ever before, from what I'm seeing. The world isn't what it was just a couple years ago and even then it was off. So now it just feels like a terrible.. trap we're all stuck in. 

There was something haunting about the fact that I was so close to my home, my sanctuary, and could have potentially never made it. 
 
I feel guilty that I almost left my mom here alone. I didn't have my phone on me that day.. and I didn't tell her I was leaving. All I can think about is the cops going to our door and telling her I was dead and her telling them they must be mistaken,

Only to go to my room and find it empty. 

I'm looking into therapy and support groups but I'm also slowly trying to adjust to not only having to cons I'm me a new diet... But adjusting to this new life with PTSD. And the new understanding that at any given moment humans can decide to take our lives like it's nothing. 

It's an unsettling reality that our lives really are in the hands of others, whether we want it to be or not. I know this was long and I'm sorry. Just...

2022-11-18 12:22:58,Anxiety,"I work in a corporate marketing management job, high pressure with constant deadlines, never-ending emails with quick decisions all day, and super fast paced. I'm always ""on"" all day, and my anxiety is through the roof and I often feel like I can't keep up with the pace of work, or the pressures of the job. My sleep is awful, and I'm just dead in the evenings and weekends and crippled with anxiety and dread for the next workday. This is my second time in this type of role and the anxiety has been consistently debilitating, even after switching companies.

I talk to my family to get the good ol' parental advice, and they often just give me the old ""life is hard, stress is everywhere, find ways to cope with it"". I get that things like meditation, exercise, therapy, CBT, eating healthy, journaling, etc. can all help with anxiety, and they're all great tools for managing anxiety. But they just don't seem to work well enough for me, I feel like I'm just a horrible fit for this type of role, as someone who is naturally just much slower paced, methodical, introspective, and more of a 'thinker' than an action-oriented 'do-er' which is what the kinds of marketing roles I'm in require. 

At what point does trying to utilize coping tools, like therapy, meditation, etc. to cope with anxiety, no longer make sense? Is there a point where it's better to just quit, and eliminate the anxiety trigger altogether (in this case, my job) and find something less trigger-ing a better fit for my personality?","Job/career anxiety - seeking coping mechanisms (therapy, meditation, etc) vs. eliminating the trigger (job) altogether?"
2022-11-18 12:22:04,Anxiety,"Hello! This might be a dumb question, but here goes..

I've been having gastro issues all year, due to being in a very stressful situation. I've had it all, except vomiting. Really.. had it all..

Lately I'm dealing with bloating (apparently it gets better sometimes but comes back), knot feeling upper abdomen, a bit of nausea sometimes, acid reflux, gut noises, ocassionaly stabbing pains mostly right side, although not too bad, and soft, smooth, thin stools.
Also, I'm having bowel movement every 3 or 4 days, but maybe that's because I'm having a very lousy breakfast and only one other meal every day, cause I can't afford more.

Earlier I've had very frequent bowel movements, diarrhea, constant stomach pain, everything I ate would make me feel sick.

Also the stools now got thin and soft from one day to the other, it wasn't gradual.

Now the question! (It's in the title..so no surprise here lol)
I'm worried about all kinds of cancer, obviously... But isn't all this variation of symptoms, a positive thing? Like, of course it's not good going through this, but isn't that a sign that it's not cancer? I'm still under a lot of stress, and like I said, I'm not eating a lot, and not eating well either.

I know it can be a lot of things, I just don't want it to be cancer. There was never blood in stool, apart from a couple of times where I had ruptures (is that what they're called?). And never vomited. I had fatigue, but it went away long time ago, and I don't seem to be losing excessive amounts of weight, apart from the obvious due to lack of regular eating.

The constant stomach pains sort of went away a few days ago, maybe a week ago. But I'm worried there's a blockage somewhere, a tumor, and it's only gonna get worse.. although it's been months, like more than half a year, and I'm still somewhat okay, like, wouldn't it be much, much worse by now?

I'm sorry this is insanely long but my mind is all over the place right now.

Until months later I began getting more anxiety again. Then after having physical symptoms on and off, I was told my the PCP to consider therapy and possibly going back on lexapro. I said I would think about it. Today the first session went well. But I got scared when the psychologist said that based on what I said my anxiety sounds like it is neurobiologically based. I don't know why, but that scared me a lot. I instantly jumped to the worst thought, and I imagined my brain to be congenitally deformed or that I had a tumor in my amygdala. I know that anxiety has a neurobiological basis, but the serious tone of the psychologist didn't help lol. She then suggested lexapro again, and then said it would help a lot with absorbing the techniques to control anxiety. I told her that I was hesitant because of the first week or 2 of lexapro suck based on my prior experience. 
Point of my post is just to vent and look for support. I also feel bad because I might have to go back on lexapro. I feel like I failed.",First session of therapy today

I constantly worry that I'm this close to losing my job. I have a great, well paying, permanent job with the Government. I'm one of the top performers in my department. Yet, I'm constantly over analyzing cues from colleagues and management. I imagine everyone hates me, that I'm on the chopping block. If there were layoffs, I'd be cut, etc. I'm a single parent and have no idea where I'd work if I lost my job. Therefore I can only imagine I'd lose my house, my car, have to file bankruptcy after a while. Ultimately I picture myself losing custody to my ex and living in my car. It's completely ridiculous, but the possible snowball effect if I lost my job absolutely haunts me every day. 

On top of that, my delusions of people hating me have become worse lately. I feel like 7 people actively dislike me and talk behind my back at the moment.

When I had it I was smoking weed (first time smoking pot in over 3 years) and I started panicking out of no where, felt like I couldn’t breathe, adrenaline rush etc. lasted about 30 minutes and then I went to sleep and woke up perfectly fine. I thought it was just a really bad reaction to the weed, previously I used to smoke ALL the time so it was still kinda weird but I didn’t think too much of it.


I had my second one about 3 weeks ago. I was tryna sleep and I jumped out of bed bc I started feeling that panic feeling. Same symptoms except this time when I woke up I felt extremely dizzy and tired. (I did research and found panic attacks and the second I read all the symptoms I KNEW it was a panic attack) I missed work because of it. And the next day around 10pm I felt panicky again. My girlfriend took me to the er where they confirmed it was a panic attack and they gave me a shot of hydroxyzine. And prescribed me hydroxyzine pills. I went home and felt extremely high, I was okay with it, body numbness etc. then I woke up and for 5 days straight I felt like a zombie and my whole body was numb, dizzy vision etc. they doctor said it was only suppose to last 48 hours… but he said it could of been different for me since I’m new to meds in general. 

Ever since I knew it was a panic attack I been on edge constantly even almost scaring myself into another panic attack multiple times. 

I then did research and found out breathing exercises. The “lean into it” method. And regardless what I do or try to convince myself to think I’m still extremely scared of living a lifetime feeling like this.

2022-11-18 10:27:44,Anxiety,"For a good chunk of my life I've had anxiety of loud noises, especially sudden ones with a low frequency (thunder, fireworks, super heavy bass, etc). However I've found that ANY sort of low frequency noise, especially sudden impact noise, can make me almost emotionally violent and it takes every ounce of me not to kill whoever/whatever is making it. 

At first I thought I had hyperacusis (super sensitive hearing), but it was ruled out at the audiologist because I wasn't experiencing discomfort typical for someone with that disorder during the test. He said that what I was experiencing was definitely psychological, since it immediately invokes a stress reaction and only has certain sound triggers. Okay, definitely makes sense. 

I've had horrible experiences with impact noise specifically coming from children. I somehow twice in a row have ended up in apartments either next to or below children under the age of 7. The noise doesn't bother my fiancée all that much, but it sometimes drives me so insane that I have to take a benzo to calm down, and even then I'm still on edge. 

I was advised by the audiologist to use noise canceling headphones/earplugs as little as humanly possible, because it can make these phobic reactions worse. There's nothing we can do really to minimize the noise - the kid who runs around in the apartment next to us is on the spectrum and even the parents have a hard time controlling him, and since we share floorboards with them underneath the carpet, we feel and hear everything. The building is old and insulates poorly, so even walking sometimes makes a huge noise because of those stupid floorboards.

I’m a 37 yom, and have been suffering from anxiety and panic attacks for months. Long story short, I was diagnosed 7 years ago after a panic attack out of the blue. I was able to live mostly normal for a while. I still had symptoms but was able to brush them aside. 

Flash forward to June of this year. I was super sick with a stomach bug called Cyclospora. I was pretty much bed ridden off and on for 35 days. Spent 5 days in the hospital after the meds to treat the illness caused a mild reaction. The crutch is, I think the reaction was mild but I had a panic attack while on it making matters worse. Over the past few months, the attacks have gotten more intense. 

Flash to today, I’ve pretty much been in a panic for a week now. I started Lexapro 5mg on Monday. I’ve been to the ER on Saturday and tonight. Today, I almost passed out from panic in the ER (I work in the hospital). I literally think I’m dying all day. Anyone else have these attacks for this long?

Then when I am worried I am only thinking about me, and me only which makes me feel selfish.  

I want to for once be able to just soley think about my daughter and her, and forget about my own worries.  

If I was able to do that, I'd enjoy myself more, feel more proud of myself, but always thinking in my own head, I feel almost guilty that I am not enjoying being a Dad, and I just want to look forward to every single moment with her.  It's ironic because by doing that, I would then be happier and feel better about myself, which is selfish anyway

I guess what I am saying, is I have no confidence at all in myself as a person, so the things I do with her will always feel this way.  

I love our cuddles, I show her love and affection constantly, I always try and talk and engage with her but inside I am not always happy, so I feel guilty.

I walk in and I immediately feel like I’m shaking, sweating, my mouth gets completely dry and I cannot get a word out. I’m sure my face is white as a ghost at this point. I either ramble on and talk way too much or I get immediate brain fog, I forget everything. Which makes it worse. As I was talking and answering questions I could feel like they thought I was acting strange or just incredibly nervous or they could see me shaking. I asked for a bottle of water and apologized that I was “shaken” up because I was hit from behind at the red light before I got here. WHY DID I LIE. I hate when I do that, but I did it anyway to compensate for an awful interview. Ugh it was awful. It went okay but I just had bad vibes and just fucking lied that I got hit from behind because I was shaking and stuttering my words and not making sense. I felt like I was going to pass out, so saying that made me feel just a tiny bit better. 
In the past I have also quit jobs on the spot. Run out the back door of jobs. All this weird avoidance stuff. I wish I knew the root of the problem.",I lie when I have severe anxiety.
2022-11-18 08:54:37,Anxiety,"Started ssris a while back for my anxiety, it was near constant and it got to the point where I was in mental pain most days. Now it's gone. And in the place where it was, I just have apathy. It feels strange to say it seems like the anxiety was all that was holding my life together. I finished school assignments not because I cared but because It would start eating away at my very soul if I didn't finish them. Now it's just nothingness. I don't care. I keep trying to care. I now have three late assignments, something unthinkable to me only a while back and I keep thinking about them but I'm not anxious. So that's something I guess.  
All I can really say is this sucks. :/",Anxiety was the only thing keeping me afloat.
2022-11-18 08:50:00,Anxiety,"If I was intellectually disabled borderline or mild..  would I have been able to pass my CNA certification? 

My therapist says I seem to have average intelligence by the way I speak. She said I'd have to be average by the way I passed my CNA. I was so worried I got my IEP papers back yesterday. I'm an adult and called and asked for them. I'm 25, I had a feeling I was intellectual disabled. Find out on my papers it was a reading disability, which has been stabilized. In school I was in IEP. I struggled in math and had attention deficit due to my ADD. I was in basically normal classes but a few were lower ended, but I was with other kids that weren't in special education. Some just had a para. In my eval it said i was going the same rate as my peers except a few classes. I'm very good at writing papers and spelling. I just had a hard time with math and reading comprehension.
If I had an intellectual disability wouldn't they have found it by now? The reason they put me in it I was missing school and fell behind. My mom says I'm fine. My therapist says I'm average intelligence due by the way I speak and how I was able to get my CNA.

Am I overthinking this? Wouldn't they have known before 25???
In the hospital, im a CNA and they say how good of a job I do. I do blood sugars and assist patients with daily living tasks. Would a person with borderline or mild intellectual disabilities would they be able to do this? Am I overthinking this?
I want to be normal.. my therapist said it's anxiety. That I'm average intelligence being I was able to pass my CNA test",Is this anxiety? or Low IQ?

we were literally looking at book covers and saying that we like them but maybe she said weird because there were some mangas, at this point had been in the store for a total of 5 minutes. 

My friend has more severe anxiety than I do and she just froze and for some reason I just got angry. I told the lady “we’ve only been in this one section and we’re talking about the book covers” and she decided to keep screaming so I just said okay repeatedly until she left us alone.

I genuinely don't want to burden anybody and telling anyone how I feel seems like it would do that. I don't want any of my friends to think I'm trying to gaslight them into giving me sympathy or anything. I'm genuinely just not feeling the point lately and I really feel like dipping out on everyone. 

Any advice from any anonymous redditors here? I feel like an achingly strong sense of self hatred and I can't shake it. I can't be alone with myself lately and when I do I ignore everything i feel with funny Instagram reels to give me like 1 minute of fleeting happiness (if you could call it that) I'm scared that if I sit and think too much it will get worse. I guess you could say I'm running from my feelings and I'm scared of them catching up but they are starting too, and this technique has gotten me by in the past so I kind of don't know how to cope.

I’ve had severe anxiety for 4 years and when I would get to my breaking point I typically just go to my primary care physician to seek help. They start me on SSRIs and a few months later I stop taking them because I didn’t feel like it helped or made my anxiety worse.

2022-11-18 07:44:16,Anxiety,"I’m so tired anymore, I just want a break or permanent vacation from life and i’m only 23. 

I’ve never had it easy in life but I used to be a much happier person. Despite being forced to drop from high school when I was 16 to pick up full time work, I have been moderately successful. Enough to afford a really nice new car, my own apartment, a few credit cards, and having a bit in savings.. at least until this year. Things have been so hard financially, I live with the constant fear I’ll lose my job even though I’m really good at it and love it, food and gas costs double almost triple what it did in 2019 and I can hardly afford to eat anymore. I work to pay debt off now essentially.

I tell my girlfriend, someone i’ve been friends with since I was 12, that I am ready to go back to school. Despite dropping from school, i’ve kept up with my education and am very smart. I’m taking courses right now to get my hs diploma and have plans to enroll in a mechanical engineering program so I can work in the aerospace field. Despite this being my life dream, my girlfriend is completely non supportive of my ambitions, saying how much time and money it will cost.. yet at the same time she tells me how she wants to get married to me and have kids and be a stay at home mom. Like?? I have no formal education and make only $17 an hour and am struggling right now as it is.
I brought up the idea that in order to make ends meet and give me a faster track toward my education and career goals, I could enlist in the service. She is super against this and shuts down any time I mention anything related to my dreams/goals.

After being on my own since I was 16, I am so extremely tired, have become cynical, angry, and nihilistic. I think myself into self depreciating, anxiety attacks and depressive episodes. I’m disinterested from being a normal 23 year old now, I have no idea how to make friends anymore, how to find a higher paying job that won’t slave me out, or how to even exist without going into crisis mode. I don’t even know what my next step in life is because it seems like despite my best efforts, everything feels the same if not worse.

Then we did for the first time and I enjoyed it, but counted down everyday to my period and would be up all night thinking what if I’m pregnant.

2022-11-18 06:41:51,Anxiety,"Hi! Using my Swiftie throwaway, because why not. 

Forgive me in advance for venting, I've just hit a wall and I'm very frustrated. 

I'm almost 28 years old, and for the majority of my life I've been diagnosed with something indicating my brain isn't working the way it typically should. 

When I was younger, it was GAD because I was so afraid of vomiting that I wouldn't eat, so petrified by failure that I didn't want to go to school, so on-edge and afraid of conflict that I couldn't be around my parents. I took Xanax for that. It made me feel comatose. I got off it. 

When I was in my early twenties, it was ADHD because those racing thoughts entirely prevented me from succeeding at college. I felt incapable of absorbing information. I took Adderall for that. It made me feel irritable, but in control. I got off it, albeit reluctantly. 

When I was in my mid-to-late twenties, it was depression because I constantly succumbed to dread. I told my doctor I felt like a robot. I because obsessive about my health to the point of demanding MRIs multiple times because I felt ""lumps in my face"" (reader, they were bones). I couldn't focus. I took — and still take — Prozac and Wellbutrin for that. I'm in therapy, too.   


Some of my more annoying edges have since been smoothed over. My phobias are no longer making it difficult to exist, and I don't have full-scale, I'm-gonna-die-type panic attacks. But I cannot concentrate or complete a task to save my life. It's been this way for years. 

  
The only thing that seemed to help with that — Adderall — also has a reputation for making anxiety worse, and it seems like anxiety is at the root of all my ills, anyway. So I don't know where to turn, except back to square one: the horrible panic I'm making my way toward, because I am behind on tons of projects and, instead of finishing any of them, just keep starting new ones. It's not just procrastination. I am excited by my work. But I feel like completing that work would require brain capacity I just don't have. I hyper-fixate on small stuff — some may say I'm very, very careful in my work — at the expense of literally everything else. I am terrified of getting something wrong. I am terrified about producing something bad. So instead, I make nothing at all.

I took a sick day today after completing the necessary amount of work because I just couldn't stand myself. And now I can't stand myself even \*more\* because I took a sick day. Alas!

I'm seeing a psychiatrist on Monday, but I don't even know where to start with them. I feel like we're just spinning a wheel and landing on different drugs and diagnoses until reaching some sad conclusion that, actually, I'm irreparably fucked. I want to get off SSRIs because I'm not sure they're actually doing anything, I want to avoid Xanax because it made me a zombie and I'm afraid of becoming addicted, and I want to get on Adderall but also \*don't\* want to get on Adderall.

Has anyone been in a situation like this before and recovered from it? I know I have to live with this monster forever, but I'd like to think I could throw a sweater on it every once and a while and make it look presentable.

But I remembered that not only these past few days but it happened one too many times for months. I thought it was just hunger I was facing. This caused my big weight gain but I started to realise recently that this could be an anxiety issue? 

Anyone else experience in a similar way? Im open for an advice on how to handle this. Thanks!",Anxiety Attack?

I don't know what to do. I called my parents, my mom got angry and my dad straight up said he doesn't know what to do. I'm scared.

Every time I go to school I start to cry, my intrusive thoughts get worse. I always feel bad that I cant concentrate enough. That I will get a bad grade. That I'm just too lazy or not good enough for life, that I won't succeed and that I will have a sad life. 
I'm scared that the school will not let me pass this year because I will doo too many absences. 

My teachers are supportive too, but I fear that if they are supportive now then I will get used to not working hard enough. I fear that if I stay like this for too long I won't get used to suffering for work and life.

I'm scared. My therapist tried to help me but she just tells me to try and go to school anyways. But I can't, after 2 years of going to school with anxiety, I'm just sick of suffering there (5th year of HS).

I know that this will sound bad. But I just want to be diagnosed with *something*. I want someone to tell me that it's ok, what I'm feeling is normal, and that there is nothing I can do. That there is some ""magical"" medication that will help me with this. But my therapist and basically everyone that I know just told me I have anxiety/OCD and nothing else, and that what I'm feeling is just being lazy/due to having anxiety. But I cannot live like this.

2022-11-17 14:45:16,Anxiety,"First post here so let’s go!

I’ve had anxiety for as long as I can remember. I believe it started when I was five years old after throwing up in class, which kickstarted a lifetime phobia. Ever since, when I’ve felt slightly off, I get anxiety/have a panic attack. 

Over the years I’ve had a better handle on it but over the last few years, it’s gotten SO much worse. I now am fearful of going out to eat because I feel trapped and I’m worried about having a panic attack. I’ve cancelled multiple catch ups with friends in fear of having a panic attack. I’ve barely been going to gym which is so unlike me and I spend my spare time in bed most of the time. Ultimately, I’m terrified of having a panic attack  so I do whatever is necessary to remove myself from any potentially ‘dangerous’ situation. 

Recently, I’ve been feeling this gnawing feeling in my stomach but have put it down to hunger (because it usually occurs a couple of hours after eating). I then become immediately panicked and desperate to eat something ASAP because it’s such an intense feeling, it kind of makes me nauseous. 

When I’m anxious (which is every day), I barely drink water because I feel sick. I read that dehydration can cause anxiety and mimic hunger pangs, so I’m curious if that’s why I’ve been feeling this way. I know I should drink more water but I feel so helpless trying to fix this. 

Not currently on any medication (I live in country where mental health is pretty taboo and what is available is VERY expensive), I do constant breathing exercises and meditation, etc. 

Has anyone else experienced this before? Any help is appreciated 🙏🏼","Hunger, Dehydration, Anxiety, Dread - anyone else?"

I am scared of pooping in general and I don't know if anybody else has this fear but I do and I feel like I'm going to die if I poop so I have been taking miralax for a year straight now and I know I'm harming myself doing that but I'm trying. I have a therapist and have now for a month or two but I don't feel like we are getting anywhere. I am down to 2 consecutive days of miralax instead of three so I guess that's progress but I need to get better like last year and I know it's a long process but I can't live like this. And about a week after I started therapy I got TMJ from clenching my teeth because my jaw didn't feel aligned and was unable to eat for a month and a half and now that I'm better I'm scared to eat. The main thing that comes to mind is the tiny pieces that can get stuck in your throat and be uncomfortable and I'm terrified of that and along with that my saliva has been  DUMMY THICK and I can't swallow that so I'm constantly spitting and constantly starving.

2022-11-17 14:21:15,Anxiety,Hi all so for maybe about 2 years I kept having these sharp pains in my lower right abdomen followed by very light bleeding when I wiped I thought it might’ve been ovulation bleeding because I noticed that every time I noticed the blood it’ll be around my ovulation and fertile days. I still went to my  obgyn and had numerous vaginal ultrasounds as well as regular ultrasounds they all came back normal then I had a CT scan which didn’t show too much just some non obstructing kidney stones but the drs didn’t even mention that the stones would cause a problem until I had a pretty serious kidney stone attack to where I was bleeding with extreme flank pain. ER doctor recommended I see a urologist and I did and scheduled a ureteroscopy and got the kidney stones blasted I had a stent in for 5 days wasn’t too much discomfort. Sorry I forgot to mention I kept getting utis from those kidney stones as well but since I had them removed 6 months I haven’t had any pain discomfort or a uti but recently I got a uti I will say I haven’t been drinking any water *which I should’ve* and I’ve been experiencing pelvic cramps and back pain but I don’t think the back pain is related to my uti because it feels more like tailbone and sciatic pain because it only occurs when I’m sitting down. Anyways I’m taking Macrobid today is my third day and I still feel crampy and a bit of pressure and now I’ve been googling and just like I was panicking about having ovarian cancer before I found out I have kidney stones I’m freaking out about it again because shouldn’t my cramps and discomfort be resolved by now it’s day three of taking the Macrobid.

He gets me out of the house. He was the sole reason I didn’t commit suicide. (I didn’t want to leave him confused and sad)

2022-11-17 12:18:34,Anxiety,"Let's say you are a surgeon, and suddenly you start worrying about your hands shaking during a surgery. When not worrying about it, your hands are very steady.

Next time you are in a surgery, your hands indeed start shaking due to worrying about it.

Now you're even more worried because your worry became true. You know this is 100% psychosomatic, but that doesn't help the fact that it physically made your hands shake.

They say that exposure therapy helps with fears, but if you constantly have bad experiences where you are unable to perform surgeries due to shaky hands, doesn't that just enforce the fear?

If you fear something, and the fear doesn't become real enough times and you have positive experiences, then I would imagine the worrying ceases.

But how do get over a worry that you know is 100% from anxiety i.e. ""not real"", but oftentimes becomes reality?

Obviously, if you manage to reduce your anxiety to a healthy level (anxiety is not a disease by itself, but an emotion), that would mean you wouldn't worry about such things. But in the short-term, if your anxiety is still higher than necessary, how do you move past such worries?

2022-11-17 11:43:51,Anxiety,"I know the topic may sound weird, but english is not my first language. I will try to give you context.
So, everything is slowly working out in my life. My relationship with my girlfriend, parents and friends after my pre-depression state (that's what my psychiatrist called it in june). I slowly started to get out of this in september when I sorted some of my toughest problems. Thoughts of giving up started to fade away.
But lately I have a feeling that I'm missing something,  constantly. When I'm alone I just sometimes get lost in thoughts and doze off (while doing shit like scrolling tiktok or facebook(I don't pay attention then, just scrolling and thinking) or just when Im relaxing.
Sometimes it's even hard to tell what Im thinking of it and why... Everything looks great in my life but I feel like some puzzle is missing... Especially when I see my girlfriend happy about things like her favourite show or seeing a friend or even when one my friends have to talk to me about their problems (but they rarely ask me about how I feel... And I just don't want to be a whiny bitch and complain all the time)... I feel like I'm playing a third-plane role in my life because I don't see my girlfriend excited for me as much as for other stuff (I know she sees me often so it's normal she wont be excited all the time) and feel like some people are forgetting about me when I don't start the convo....
Just tell me what to do... Im tired of being happy but feeling just ""glad"".",how to deal with alone time anxiety?
2022-11-17 11:40:37,Anxiety,"I've had pretty bad hypochondria for nearly a decade. It tends to come in cycles, I have a low-level background amount and then ever so often (typically once a year or so) I have a massive flare up.

Right now, I'm in a pretty bad flare up. My current fear is dementia, particularly a couple of different kinds that start with visual troubles or hallucinations. Because of that anytime I see something remotely out of the ordinary and someone else isn't around to see it I have a panic attack. For instance, I the light on my switch controller randomly comes on despite the machine being asleep and I panic because it's always when I'm by myself. 

Tonight, I was driving and had a panic attack because I randomly saw fireworks just ahead of me despite it being like 8pm in November and my state only allowing sales in June, July, and December. 

In my anxiety I asked a couple of people on foot if they saw them, one girl said she heard it then saw the colors, another dude said he heard but didn't see it, and finally someone else a few streets over told me I was high and to go home. 

Now I'm spiraling worried that I'm hallucinating things and it's an impending dementia (like Lewy Body Dementia) and I'm going to slowly deteriorate and leave my family with a dysfunctional mess to handle. I worry about not being there for my kids. 

I started Lexapro again, 5mg, but it just seems to make me sleepy and a bit placid. 

Honestly, I just needed to vent with people who get it. My family is pretty callous about this kind of stuff and I think tired of dealing with me. I'm really frustrated because this comes on the heels of having like 8 straight really good weeks.

Anyone else deal with this particular fear?",In a hypochondria spiral. Worried about silly stuff.

2022-11-17 11:24:18,Anxiety,"Over a year ago, I did something pretty embarrassing and shameful that no one besides myself and my therapist know about. I tried to find out someone's birthday online without asking the specific person. It was my ex-girlfriend's mother, I wasn't on speaking terms with the girlfriend but I was still friendly with her family and wanted to do something nice for her mother on her birthday. This seems pretty innocent, but I went on one of those sites that apparently looks everywhere for any information on someone.

I didn't finish the task, I quit shortly into the ""search"" but still feel like I violated this person's privacy even though I gained no information from it. I immediately felt ashamed while doing this, and after talking to my therapist about it, I started to feel better.

But I recently started talking to my ex again and this mistake that I haven't thought about for a long time just came back and now I feel like I have to tell this person to clear my conscience. I have an appointment with my therapist tomorrow, but not until later in the day and I am sort of freaking out at the moment.",Past Mistake
2022-11-17 11:21:42,Anxiety,"I've had really bad anxiety for as long as I can remember. My parents say I've been showing signs basically since I could talk. I have some great early memories, but so many of them revolve around anxiety and stress. I was always afraid. I have always been afraid. Sometimes I just think to myself ""I'm scared"" randomly, but no matter how hard I try I can't think of anything I'm scared of, I just feel scared. I've gotten pretty good at managing my symptoms over time and I think I probably seem normal now but when I was younger my anxiety always prevented me from making friends. I was terrified to use playground equipment because I was scared I would fall off. I had frequent panic attacks for sometimes almost no reason, like not even seeing a bug but worrying that a bug could be in the room. I would obsessively think about things for days on end, concentrating on nothing else, because I was scared of them, any tiny random thing that made me uncomfortable or nervous. 

It's not quite that bad anymore but I still struggle so much with anxiety, I'm just better at hiding it. I don't know why that I ever happened. Well, I do. It runs in the family on both sides, I don't know anyone in my immediate OR extended family on either side that doesn't have some type of anxiety disorder. But it doesn't make sense to me how it could be purely genetic. When I was a little kid, nothing traumatic that I can think of happened to me that could've caused that level of anxiety. At this point, some difficult things have happened in my life, sure, but not when I was two years old. I know anxiety has a genetic feature but I don't see how you could just have anxiety with nothing bad that happened to cause it.

Bad karma? Did me in a past life commit some major sin and this is the punishment? I feel lost...",Why did I have to be born like this?
2022-11-17 11:20:50,Anxiety,"I have almost daily panic attacks, atleast once to twice a week, I worry myself sick and have to throw up because it gets so bad. I've lost weight because of it, as if i wasn't already skinny enough. My heart races almost constantly when I'm not with or talking to the people I love, I feel drained and super depressed, I dont get anything done because I can't shake away my anxiety. No distractions help at all, and trust me I've tried countless different things...

I don't have anxiety about myself, like at all. That's the thing. I mostly worry about my family. And most severely, I worry about my LDR girlfriend, who lives in Germany. Mostly, I worry about something happening to them, or mostly i just worry about my long distance girlfriend. It gets so bad to the point where if she doesn't respond to me within 10-30 minutes, I start panicking. Now, i dont bother her with messages or anything, if i get too worried ill just send a single ""you there?"" message but that rarely happens.

Me and her were just together physicall during october up until now after knowing eachother for a year. She just had to leave today and I've never really been more scared or anxious in my life. I feel like I can't stop crying, i can't rest, i can't do anything without borderline having a panic attack. I've been alone my whole life, I never had friends or really got to hang out with someone before so this whole experience was new to me, feeling love like that. So at first I thought it was just me being sad she had to go back home, and I am but most of it is anxiety... Anxiety that im never going to see her again because something will happen to her. I can't even watch crime or mystery shows/videos anymore, or anything to do with kidnapping or murder or disease, nothing like that because if I do, I start thinking of her or my family and my anxiety spikes up...

I've tried lots of things, I want this worry to end, it's not the long distance that bothers me, i can deal with that just fine for years on end. But even if she lived in the same country, or state in a different location, I know it'd affect me because it has before. Many times. And it never got better.

2022-11-17 10:45:12,Anxiety,"I have been struggling with anxiety, depression, and panic attacks with agoraphobia since 2017, didn’t leave my house for a year and a half at all (I literally couldn’t even turn the corner of my block without getting a panic attack). However to my therapist at the time and my surprise I was able to recover and by 2019 I was working and going to school in public, taking public transport alone, even drinking coffee, wine, beer, vaping occasionally, (although these weren’t crutches I was just trying to be a normal 20 something year old). And as you can imagine I was so happy and grateful since I never thought I’d be able to do these things ever again. But by NYE 2020 I began having awful panic attacks again and just stopped showing up to work and dropped out of school again. This was before Covid but then once everything went into lockdown I naturally sank back into agoraphobia. It’s now been 3 years and I’m worse than ever before. I have no friends or family to do exposure therapy with me and I’ve been so depressed I’ve been sleeping til 3pm. This is just a very brief overview of my situation but I’m scared I’ll never be “normal” and functional again. It’s never gone on for this long and I’m at the age where I need to start my career and make an income and move out but I genuinely fear I can’t make it out again… everythings so hard every little thing and I just want to pretend I’m not alive by sleeping my life away bc it’s pointless to me.

2022-11-17 10:21:10,Anxiety,"My mom is going abroad on a trip for several weeks an entire ocean away. I've never been this far from a parent ever, and I've never been away from a parent for this long. I feel goofy about this because I am an adult, but I'm living at home as I'm still in school so I see my parents every day, and for my mom to be gone, so far away, for so long, is terrifying. I'm so scared something bad will happen to her abroad and we have no way of getting there without spending about 20 hours travelling. I'm also afraid something bad will happen here at home to my dad and I won't have my mom to help or to turn to. I have such a hard time when I'm not in a position to easily reach a parent in an emergency, even when I travel on my own within our country I feel worried about not being able to (relatively) easily check that everything is okay. The timezone means we will only be awake at the same time for a few hours per day (at most 3 realistically) so contacting her in real time will be hard, and I'm so scared of not hearing from her for a long time because she's busy or fell asleep and thinking that something bad had happened. 

Again, I feel ridiculous as an adult for being so afraid. People travel places all of the time and the vast majority of their family members aren't stricken with horrible fear that something bad will happen, so why can't I be not afraid?

2022-11-17 08:05:20,Anxiety,"I had my first panic attack 4 months ago, and it turned my life upside down. There wasn’t any traumatic event that caused it, which made it difficult to dissect. Following that attack the anxiety never left, my days were consumed by fear and worry. I began to attach my safety to external factors, like being at home, or being with a safe person. These behaviors only contributed to my deterioration, as I was reinforcing the fear I’d felt. 

I was afraid to eat. I was afraid to drive 5 minutes to the grocery store. I was afraid to be home alone. I was afraid to be out alone. I was afraid of anything that could displace me from my perceived “safety”. But I knew that I couldn’t live like this forever. I ultimately realized that I was not afraid of these events, but I was afraid of panic. Afraid of panicking away from a “safe” space, and being unable to return. I thought an attack would occur so severe that there was no possible way I’d be able to get through it, and that fear kept me paralyzed.

The only path forward for me was acceptance and grit. Accepting my anxiety as an emotion I’m feeling, but disregarding it’s impact on my actions. Using CBT and Exposure Therapy hand in hand to push my boundaries each day. People will say that soothing acceptance is the best path, but I needed a metric fuck ton of grit to get through anxiety. You need to say “If I do (x) it will suck. I’ll feel like I’m dying. But I won’t die, and I’ll prove to myself that I AM my own safe space. I’ll prove that anxiety, fear, and panic attacks cannot control my life.” Once I stopped thinking “I wish this would go away, life has become so difficult, I miss the person I used to be” and started thinking “I’ll fight this shit as long as it takes to beat it”, I improved drastically.

I write this now, proudly able to say I recently drove 100 miles to go see friends and spend 3 nights away. Was I anxiety free? No. But I was panic free, and my anxiety hovered around a 1-2/10 the entire time. When just a few months ago I’d have a panic attack driving 10 minutes away.

2022-11-16 16:23:57,Anxiety,"Let's say you are a surgeon, and suddenly you start worrying about your hands shaking during a surgery. When not worrying about it, your hands are very steady.

Next time you are in a surgery, your hands indeed start shaking due to worrying about it.

Now you're even more worried because your worry became true. You know this is 100% psychosomatic, but that doesn't help the fact that it physically made your hands shake.

They say that exposure therapy helps with fears, but if you constantly have bad experiences where you are unable to perform surgeries due to shaky hands, doesn't that just enforce the fear?

If you fear something, and the fear doesn't become real enough times and you have positive experiences, then I would imagine the worrying ceases.

But how do get over a worry that you know is 100% from anxiety i.e. ""not real"", but oftentimes becomes reality?

Obviously, if you manage to reduce your anxiety to a healthy level (anxiety is not a disease by itself, but an emotion), that would mean you wouldn't worry about such things. But in the short-term, if your anxiety is still higher than necessary, how do you move past such worries?

I went into inpatient last year and the psychiatrist said I had depression and ptsd and anxiety and sent me on my way. It was my therapist that sent me to psychiatrist and suggested I might have OCD. I have objected to medication because I have tried many before the OCD diagnosis and they all have had some kind of side effect that has made me worse. Latuda made me antsy and gave me restless leg.

2022-11-16 15:38:33,Anxiety,"So, like the title says, my panic attacks have come back in full swing.  I've had anxiety for as long as I remember. There are certain parts of my childhood that I think this stemmed from, but if I dissected it all this post would be way too long. The turning point for me was a day in elementary school. Everyone  was eagar to go home when the last few minutes of class hit, and we were crowded around the door waiting for the bell to ring. That's when I experienced derealization for the first time. I felt completely detached from reality. From that point forward, the fear of that feeling would be what stopped me from living my life. I confused my parents because I turned into a different kid. Going anywhere would cause extreme distress. I woke up feeling sick every morning. I didn't want to go to school. I didn't want to leave the house. Flash forward a few years, I started high school and worked through the anxiety the best I could because I didn't have much of a choice. I started therapy, and felt pretty stable as long as I had a set routine. I'd have a panic attack with a DR episode at the peak every so often, but I managed go carry on. In my final year, I experienced the worst of it. I couldn't leave my bedroom for a month. My grades slipped, and I ended up taking a year off to work on myself before starting university. It took years to finally get to a good place. I started a full time university program at 21, got a good job, and was able to do whatever I needed/wanted to do without feeling any anxiety. On the rare occasion that it did pop up, I'd be able to control it easily. 

Now I'm 24, and I'd been doing really well until a few weeks ago. I caught one virus after another, and ended up being sick about 5 times in the last 3 months. I ended up having to spend a lot of time on my own at home, and I think that's where the anxiety resurfaced. I noticed that every time I recovered from a virus, I'd spend the next couple days or weeks with higher than normal anxiety. This time, I had a virus that kept me ill for 2 weeks. My anxiety has skyrocketed. I haven't experienced panic like this in years. I haven't had drealization like this in years. It feels like everything is falling apart. I have a great support system in the form of my boyfriend and mom, and I've still managed to go to work and to the gym. But I just had another pretty severe attack tonight, and I don't know if I'll be able to make it to school or work this week. I've reached out to a therapist to try and get on top of all of this, but I guess I'm posting partly to vent and partly because I want to feel less alone. I really thought I had made it through the storm so to speak. I didn't think I'd ever be back at this point again. It's discouraging and exhausting.

even when i'm home i'm constantly anxious, and it just keeps. getting. worse.. it feels like the walls are slowly closing in more and more, or rather moving out, to infinity, to the overwhelming size and intense brightness of the entire universe exposing itself all at once, and i can't take it anymore.

i can't function at all. nothing motivates me anymore, i can't do anything anymore. nothing holds my interest, i don't care about anything, i don't even care much about the only irl friend i have anymore. and tbh i don't think anyone still cares about me either.  
the only thing that kinda manages to distract me are horror games (i know, sounds weird) and listening to music, but even that can't hold my interest anymore..

i feel so apathetic, i don't know what to do. it feels like everything's crumpling down, every friendship, every hope i once had, my mental health, my whole life, just. everything.  
i'm so tired of living, i feel so dead inside, i look in the mirror and all i can see is a ugly face that doesn't seem like it should belong to me staring back at me with those dead, empty eyes. i don't even know who i am anymore. i don't think there is any personality left.

i wish i could live a life that's worth living, but i can't.

You might think to yourself that makes sense, but in our society, it means to gather wealth, well-being, and solitude before feeling the slightest remorse for others. All I feel is remorse for others than myself, and to be honest, I will gladly worsen my health to put on a face that those can see until they change their well-being to become greater than they could ever imagine. This is my purpose, as others rise, I will fall, and I am fine with this end. As the curtain closes on my story, other stories will blossom in remembrance of the impact I had on them. You might be thinking at this point, are you suicidal? Never, but I will do what I find necessary to keep my mind in check worsening my physical being, providing to those deserving of second chances at a meaningful life. I will provide until the reaper calls my name, then I will feel at peace while others live until the reaper eventually has them join me. I hope you understand how I feel, and if you feel the same, do not worry, you will always have me in your corner to fight the devil within you. As I said, I will be here for those until my time runs out.",The Purpose of Life

2022-11-16 14:02:37,Anxiety,"I’ve got pretty bad anxiety, but i feel like it’s gotten a bit better overtime.

It got to the point where i couldn’t even walk around my neighborhood or step out front without feeling like passing out. Over the past 4 months I’ve been able to go out of the house more than I’ve been able to in years, and I’ve been having heavy feelings about wanting to travel again. 

Traveling has always been like one of my escapes from reality and a place that always kept my brain distracted. I’m just stuck cause i keep thinking of the “what ifs”. Like what if i pass out in the airport, or on the plane. It’s always the what ifs, even though i KNOW i can do it. 

I feel like i should just say fuck it and chase it but at the same time i don’t know if there’s any steps i should take first. Do you guys have any tips? I’m not on any meds and never have been, i always just roll with it.

2022-11-16 13:33:32,Anxiety,"Hi everyone,

just had the worst night in months. Background: Very severe existential anxiety starting about six weeks after a traumatic event when this political situatio also started, together those two threats to my life, one immediate and one vague, were too much for my brain and something broke.

Ever since then, my life has been absolutely awful. I haven’t slept properly since then, am always bone tired, always terribly anxious and full of dread. „Anxiety” is such a small word for what I am feeling. This insomnia has given me additional fears, too, what if I get dementia (am high risk anyway) or stroke or heart disease from not sleeping…ofc I would sleep if I could. I tried a multitude of drug and non drug things, nothing works.

Anyway, short background aside, Tonight I had one of the worst night, no more than 10 mins sleep in many little exhausted naps and always waking up with a jolt of fear. Even a sleeping pill couldn’t put me to rest. Incidentally I had eaten a lot of garlic the night and day before, really a lot. And there was ofc bad news in the news  but I only read that near morning so before that it must have been something else causing this.

Does anyone know if garlic can cause anxiety in people who are already so wired?",Can garlic make anxiety and insomnia worse?

2022-11-16 13:21:47,Anxiety,"Ever since the school year started i’ve been getting hella clingy with my friends (one in particular) and anytime Im not with them i’ll try to find a way to talk with them and be around them.

This has gotten better, as earlier in the school year it was much worse to where even just not being with them for a little bit caused a mental breakdown. It’s not that bad now. However its stil particularly bad. I find myself staring at messages waiting on a response constantly and constantly having to tell myself that they are probably busy and just not looking at their phone, and that they aren’t ignoring me. 

But that feeling is still there. It feels like they find me a burden to be around even when thats not the case at all. They are aware of (most of) this. And they know im going through it and help where they can, but venting to them constantly just makes it worse, as it solidifies my anxiety that im just a burden to them.

Im not really sure why it started, but I can’t stop thinking about them and wanting to text them even after they are asleep.

And to make it worse they are one of (if not only) my best friend and i’d hate for my anxiety to be the reason they stopped talking to me, as unrealistic as it is.

It sounds like separation anxiety, which I have had in the past, but not to this extent. Nowhere close. 

I don’t know, everything in my social life feels too loose and wobbly right now, maybe im just trying to anchor something to be a constant. And what’s worse for me is that I HAVE ZERO classes with them. Even though we take the same classes (mostly). Somehow we got NONE together, and this is the THIRD YEAR IN A ROW. So I basically only see them around Lunch.

Belly breathing helps and exercise but only marginally. Already did a bunch of blood work and spoke to PCP and neurologist they all think it’s related to my anxiety.

2022-11-16 13:12:53,Anxiety,"I started a new job a few months ago. It's in a corporate, albeit relaxed, environment which is new for me. 

I can speak well in meetings with my small team but I cannot for the life of me act normal in meetings with more people. Once I begin talking, I somehow end up saying things I don't mean to say. 

I've done the following since starting this job &amp; every time my mind gets over it, another one happens:

* During an ice breaker I said I like true crime but then I elaborated that while I find it interesting, I'd hate for something like that to happen to me.

* During a different ice breaker, I said the area where I was from. Someone in the chat wrote the specific city because we had a prior conversation about the coincidence. I then proceeded to tell everyone that we had gone to the same school but at different times. Because no one saw the chat, they were just silent for like 10 seconds until someone called the other person old (which I also didn't intend by my comment).

* I needed to gain credentials to a program a client uses and my name was on the meeting agenda. When we got to my part, one of the clients said ""Who is miss snowdrop?"" even though I've now been there for a few months. I then proceeded to say in a high pitched bubbly voice, something like ""Hiiiiii (*wave*), I'm one of the ____ at ____ . I need access because_____."" The client then explained they got confused &amp; thought I was someone new on their end. I just said ""I understand"" because I was trying not to overly share any more. 

I know I'm still very new in the grand scheme to the job environment. I just hate replaying these events in my head. I do a really good job of getting my thoughts across when writing but struggle so much when I need to speak off the cuff.",Awkward/ anxious work vent

I work in an isolated job. I live in an isolated apartment. If I had anyone, I would isolate myself from them anyway. 

I feel humiliated all the time. I sneak around my appartment cause I'm scared I might disturb someone an another unit. I feel inferior to everyone. I get more and more awkward every day. 

I'm in therapy. I swear I just pay someone to watch me cry for an hour. I go back with no progress. People say ""give it time, it will work."" 

I lost 50 pounds and started lifting, go to parties with friends (I end up getting totally wasted just to deal with the anxiety and end up making an ass of myself, or I don't drink and replay every single second of an event in my head to the point where I have headaches), started trying different hobbies, and I don't feel any better. I think I feel worse.

The worst is explaining this to someone without it. It's either they know or they think I'm full of shit. I'm just lazy. I'm just bitter. Like it's a choice.

2022-11-16 09:13:47,Anxiety,"Hi everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I'm just coming here looking for some support. I'm 23, in grad school, and working 30 hrs/week at an internship. I will say up front that I work directly with my own patients in healthcare (psych, which makes this more ironic) and I am in a hospital setting. I have had pretty severe OCD and panic disorder since I was 7 or 8. I struggled severely in high school, but my anxiety virtually disappeared in college and my first year of grad school. It came back with a vengeance this summer after my boyfriend was deployed overseas on a week's notice, experiencing three deaths in my family, and getting physically sick and hospitalized for a day myself. Those couple of weeks left me in a constant state of fight or flight. I was having multiple panic attacks a day while trying to keep up with my grad courses, social life, and other responsibilities. I decided to push through for this semester instead of taking medical leave as I am SO close to graduating, but I'm crashing and burning now.

&amp;#x200B;

I've never considered myself depressed, but I definitely am now. I am normally the incredibly driven, outgoing, and motivated busy-body type, but I have completely withdrawn from everything that used to matter to me. I am barely making it to classes and my internship supervisor was gracious enough to let me work remotely temporarily. I stay in touch with my friends via text, but I can very rarely hang out with them in person due to the constant panic - it makes it torturous, not fun. I struggle through my hour-long sessions with my patients. I used to have a very clear vision for my future, but I no longer do. I would never harm myself, but I have completely lost my passion for living. All living does is terrify me, I don't experience joy anymore. I have wreaked pretty significant havoc on my almost two-year relationship with my boyfriend, he has expressed to me that lately he just feels like he's being used a tool to soothe my anxiety rather than existing as my boyfriend.

&amp;#x200B;

I am completely miserable. I am nauseous almost 24/7, which is hell because I'm emetephobic. I haven't actually thrown up, but over the summer I would dry heave which ""traumatized"" me. It happened while I was driving on a busy highway, it happened in the middle of a crowded bar, it happened in the doctor's office, in the hospital, and while other people were driving me around. Since then, I have feared spontaneously dry heaving in any situation where it would be distressing/that I can't escape - working with patients, driving, being in class, being out of the house, etc. It hasn't happened in 2 months, but I still live in fear of it. I have bad indigestion and reflux. When I wake up in the morning, my heart is immediately racing, I am shaking, sweating, nauseous and having reflux. It's incredibly different not to focus on it and just get on with my day. Sleeping is a giant struggle, and I'm probably getting in 700-900 calories per day. I also struggle to drink fluids but force myself anyway. I no longer feel like I'm able to talk myself out of panic or anxiety like I used to be. Panic is ruling my life at the moment. I feel like I just need two weeks to not be bothered by anything or anyone, but I can't get that. I'm scared that something bad is going to happen if I keep pushing my body and brain like this.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to do the best I can, but nothing is sticking. I'm in therapy 2x/week, I had been going to the gym 4-5x/week (lifting, but haven't gone in about two weeks because of how horrible I've been doing). I've tried Buspar, Hydroxyzine, Xanax, Propranolol. Nothing has helped. I'm not open to SSRIs as I almost lost my life to one in the past. I'm currently trying Magnesium, Ashwaganda and Chamomile, but they aren't helping either. My anxiety SKYROCKETED after coming off of hormonal birth control in August. I don't know if I should go back on. I have recently found out that I have pretty severe iron deficiency, which may be playing a role, so I've recently started supplementing with Iron as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

There is constantly adrenaline flowing through my body and I can't get it to stop. I am on high alert 24/7. I never used to be sensitive to external stimuli, but now light, sounds, intense emotions of others, etc. can throw me directly into a panic attack. This is extremely problematic because of the nature of my internship and I am often shouldering the intense trauma my patients have faced.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I'm just looking for advice, encouragement, tips, anything. I'd love to hear if anyone has been here before, and if so, what helped. Thanks so much in advance :(","I need help or advice, I'm falling apart and can't relax"
2022-11-16 09:10:23,Anxiety,"Hi everyone!

This past few months I have been experiencing just a general feeling of dread as well as panic attacks. I started seeing a therapist as well as a doctor who prescribed me Vistaril, which I take during a panic attack (it basically just calms me down and puts me to sleep,) and Buspar, which I’m supposed to take twice a day. I started out at 5mg last week, and tomorrow I up the dose to 10mg. I’m so nervous about doing this, as I have seen a lot of bad reviews of Buspar. I know it takes weeks to start working, and I don’t have a problem with that, but I also have really bad health anxiety and am scared of the potential side effects!

I’m a law student, so I’m no stranger to anxiety by virtue of what I’m subjecting myself to, but I’ve had panic disorder and generalized anxiety for my entire life. Only recently in the past few years, though, have I noticed that almost every anxiety episode comes with horrible stomach pain and loose stool.

I’m honestly more stressed out about my physical symptoms than I am about the anxiety itself. I used to be able to handle the occasional pang of fear or a bout of fluttering in my chest, but lately, the GI symptoms are almost unbearable. The MOMENT I feel even remotely worried, my stomach wrenches itself into a knot. I sometimes get acid reflux flares, but it’s mostly contained to my lower GI tract. I usually prolong going to the bathroom because I’m in class when these attacks occur, but when I do go, it’s…not pretty. 

I do drink coffee once a day in the morning/afternoon and possibly have tea later on, depending on my anxiety levels that day. I’m medicated with an SSRI as well that I rarely miss doses of. I have Ativan to take for emergencies, which are more frequent lately.

I don’t know what to do to ease these stomach symptoms. I have final exams approaching and the stress is already astronomical without having to worry that I might shit myself during class.

2022-11-16 07:19:12,Anxiety,I work for a medical institution and found out today they are going to have to lay off staff in January due to financial implications. I joined this institution in May of this year so naturally I feel like I’m much higher on the chopping block because I’m new. We have no idea how they are qualifying who will get laid off but I’m freaking out. And it’s even worse because they told us recently and it’s not even happening until several weeks. I can’t help but just spiral with this. I have no idea what I’m going to do if they get rid of me. This has been my favorite and the best job I’ve had and I would be devastated to be let go. The anxiety has convinced me that I’m going to be cut and I just hate to think that way and hate the uncertainty with this. Any advice on how to deal with this?,My place of employment said in January they will lay off several hundred people. I’m spiraling.

2022-11-16 07:03:23,Anxiety,"I’ve dealt with depression and anxiety for most of my life, a lot of it on my own but the past year things have slowly gotten so bad I was reduced to just being able to work and sometimes sleep and my work hours were reduced to try and lessen my stress but it didn’t help. 

Things got much worse in September when my mom passed away. I spent a week in a crisis center and took a month off work trying to get myself straightened out but it didn’t help. I went back for a half shift Saturday and it went horribly, but with no other option I had to go back again on Monday and I was so anxious and upset I cried uncontrollably for 4.5 hours in the parking lot and never made it inside. 

I don’t know what else to do. I feel like I’m drowning and people on the shore are yelling advice to me like, “have you tried pretending to swim?”, “I know a great swim teacher you can call.”, “I feel like you want to drown so I’m not going to help you until you can swim to that rock and back.”, “you’re struggling because you’re not wearing shoes and don’t have enough weight, let me put these rocks in your pockets.” None of the advice is helpful because my situation would have to improve or the anxiety lessen for any of it to work. 

I had a therapist get angry and leave the room yesterday because the self-hug technique she was trying to get me to do backfired and set me off worse because my arms get super sensitive and painful when I’m freaking out. Today a different counselor told me that the anxiety will never get better and I need to learn how to accept it and basically pretend I don’t have it. 

Everyone says I’m dong great and making steps but I don’t see it. Why is it a good thing that I can go to the store or library but then can’t even check out a book or get what I need? How am I supposed to work a full shift when I’m stuck in the parking lot crying for hours? If this is my best right now and you keep telling me it’s not gonna get better, why should I keep trying?

2022-11-16 06:57:20,Anxiety,"It is not like I lived like a hermit in the last years but I kinda never was around people a lot (except at work but that is just something else).

I never had a bigger friend group and the friendships I have had (and have) are kinda bad. Some toxic, some one sided, some just... confusing? And pretty much all of them hurtful to me. 

I almost never meet new people and if I do, I never see them again.

I go to concerts a lot and often alone (which is fine for me) and while I sometimes do talk to people there, never keep I in touch with them for some reason.

I feel like I missed an important thing in my early 20s - learning how to socialize, figure out what kind of people I want around me, deal with different situations in relationships, learning how to get to know people, learning how to kinda estimate people...

I am so so so bad at all of this and I am 26 years old. 

I am extremely lonely and need to get away from an old friend I still have but I can't because I would be even more alone. So I really want to have new people in my life. 

I just don't know how. Besides having social anxiety and being insecure as fuck, I don't know how things work. How to approach people. How to connect with them. When to ask about sharing numbers. How to ask someone to meet up without making it weird, how to word it. And also: How to know who I should trust as I have been hurt so many times now.

I also feel ashamed. Those teeth don't hurt that much (except for one), i just have to do simple filling/remove caries which is as well small. I probably shouldn't be panicking over those little things, but i still am. Last time i went to dentist there was just insane pain (for 5 seconds max). I had similiar problem but way worse. I am slightly happy i can get it cured before it starts to hurt like hell, but that doesn't help with my constant anxiety/panic over it.  


Sedation is not an option, and anesthesia is applied only to actually painful procedures, such as pulling out and deep cleaning. My dentist is well aware that i'm afraid, but what can she do? Nothing. And i'm not blaming her for this.   


I know it makes no sense to make the post right now as i have only hours left to read replies, however, i'm sure i will have to go again very soon, because I assume I can't get all 3 cured instantly. Even if the dentist manages to, i still will have to go to the dentist in my life at some point. I just want to calm down.

We had a slight disagreement and he was very very stress because of family and life stuff happening and then we met up the next day and discussed it and we were then normal but things felt a little off still. 

I’m so afraid of him not loving me anymore. I don’t want to keep being paranoid if he is falling out of love with me or not. His actions show that he loves me but it’s the nagging thoughts in my head that hurts me. I think because the vibe was a little off I think that means he is done with me.

2022-11-15 15:52:04,Anxiety,"I worked I’m a corporate environment. I’ve been in my job close to 4 years, and during that time my entire team has turned over. Often responsibilities from other positions got added to my role because we had to keep chugging. Eventually the team shrunk from about 9 people to about 3. It’s gotten to a point where I’m frequently working outside normal hours and it was destroying any life I had outside work. Finally, I couldn’t take it anymore and I put in my resignation stating that my role is unsustainable. I gave them a 3 month period so they could get a replacement I would help train. 

It’s been clear that they understand very little of my work. I support an external contract for a huge client which I have a great relationship with. No one else in the company knows how to use the software I use, which is complicated, and they are clueless regarding all the processes involved in my role.


They were only able to hire someone two weeks from my end date stating problems with the applicant pool. Not only that, but instead of hiring strictly for my role, they hired for an adjacent different title, so the person has a different skill set than my actual role.

Now it’s very awkward trying to train someone in 8 business days to do a highly specialized and detailed role, when they have completely different expectations about what the job is. They can’t even get support from anyone else because the company doesn’t know my role. 

I know the company has failed here and yet I can’t even sleep or sit still because I am so god dang anxious. My mental health is completely degraded. A lot of this knowledge sits with me only and will be gone once I leave. I feel guilty for not getting a better transition plan in order but I’m so busy and getting so little support.

I was sick for the last week, give a few days. I had a fever every single day, and was super disoriented and out of it. I actually went to the ER, and after being told that my blood levels were normal, and testing negative for the flu, covid, RSV, and strep, I was given fluids and Tylenol and sent home. I returned to work the last few days, and have still felt disoriented and out of it. I have had panic attacks everyday after waking up being concerned I will never feel better, and usually cry it out and doze off before work. The disorientation goes away, but i’m left in a brain fog for a majority of the day.

Does anyone have this experience? If so, how can I fix this?

2022-11-15 15:37:43,Anxiety,"My sister is 17. She's been in a major depressive state for a couple of months now, and it's made her prone to have more anxiety/panic attacks, to the point where she sometimes starts shaking and hyperventilating out of nowhere. She's also been experiencing sleep issues, so she's exhausted during the day, and it's especially affecting her at school (which is also the place where she usually has the most attacks). We had to forcibly leave our country around 4 years ago and she doesn't really connect with the people from this country, so she's a loner. Furthermore, she's also expressed that she doesn't know what to do with herself, and I usually wake up to cryptic text messages like ""I can't do this anymore"" or ""I'm sorry"", and for someone with past suicide attempts like me, those are no joke.

With no father figure in the picture, I'm the one stepping up for her. I'm always picking her up from school when she doesn't feel good enough to be there, always calling her to check up and let her vent, comforting her whenever she needs it. I don't mind it at all, but I'm also depressed and I don't know how to help her without getting worse myself. I've been medicated in the past but I can't say that it helped, plus I don't know if me being autistic has to do something with my depression being more ""silent"": I don't cry often and I definitely don't tell people that I'm struggling. 

It feels like I have to drop whatever I'm doing at the moment just to make sure she doesn't harm herself, and it's really affected my college life too. Sometimes I don't even have the mental energy to do what I need to do. Now it's like I wake up everyday waiting for the worst. We can't access healthcare, so she's in a long waitlist to get mental help. There's literally no one I can tell about this, and I really don't know how to tackle the situation. I love her, I do recognize her situation is serious and I promised being there for her unconditionally, but I don't know what to do. I need help.

2022-11-15 13:00:23,Anxiety,"I just want to share something that keeps on bothering me for more than a month now.

So everything started when I stayed in our house with my family in the province, a typical Filipino family where the children are living with the parents though they are already old and capable to live on their own.

I wasn't really staying in our house because I was working and living in the city hours away.  Everytime I'm home, I always notice how messy our house is, how all of them clutters everywhere with stuff that supposedly kept in their rooms. I even notice some utensils not properly washed with stains of food in it.

The whole week I was there, I noticed that one of my sister is barely doing some of the chores and is always avoiding doing things inside the house even if these are things that has something to do with her stuff. She always denies, saying it's not hers, she has nothing to do with that so she can avoid her responsibility. There was also a time when it's only the 2 of us in the house that she's not even trying to check the door when someone is knocking and I was the one who went up and down the house the whole day to see who's calling outside our house and that really pissed me off.

One morning, I was with her in the kitchen while she was washing the plates and utensils she used for her breakfast. I noticed that she was not washing the utensils properly so I jokingly pointed it out to her so it would not sound mean but again, she denied. I told her that she's always denying just to avoid doing chores in the house.

It ended a little heated, but no bad words or hurtful things said aside from those i mentioned, then she went back again to her room. The next day, she's not talking and is obviously avoiding me which made me feel a uneasy. I know that I have to tell to her those things so she knows that its not ok and everyone needs to do their part in maintaining our house.

 We already talked a little but there's something off, she only answers my question and doesn't even look at me. I don't like us to be like this but at the same time I can't accept that kind of attitude. I'm away working for several months now and it still bugs me.

The reasons I went this time around is:

- still have minor social anxiety (not major, but it’s enough I don’t talk to people, freeze up when people speak to me, I get flustered, blank out in convos). I have trouble making friends for this reason. 

- feeling depressed sometimes 

- head feels empty and emotionless 

- when anxious thoughts start, often they will spiral and i think the worst 

- very poor memory - I forget things, and will blank out after a convo and even during. 

- struggling to maintain an organized living space

- as a child, I had nervous tics — and I’ve developed some again as an adult. Not always but when I’m feeling very stressed or anxious it happens. Mine is eye movement (straining to see out if the sides of my eyes) and cracking my neck excessively. Some eyebrow raising and nose scrunching too.

I've been struggling with Anxiety for over 10 years now &amp; have gone through periods of being on and off medication for it, but this is by far the worst it's ever been. A large trigger for my anxiety is the feeling that I'm going to choke or that something's stuck in my throat, &amp; then I go into an anxiety spiral as a result. I had an incident where I was home alone &amp; a pill got lodged in my throat &amp; since then I have an aversion to taking pills. However now - or I should say about 8 months ago - my symptoms came on very suddenly &amp; unexpectedly. I was eating breakfast when I felt my heart rate increase, I got dizzy &amp; felt like I was going to pass out. Ended up driving myself to the ER and they essentially just said ""nothings wrong but here's a prescription for hydroxyzine"" and I was on that for a few weeks until I connected with my PCP. We figured out a plan &amp; I went back on my anxiety meds after not needing them for the past 10 years, but it's not enough. 

Long story short: My diet has been extremely limited over the last 7 months or so where I'm only eating yogurt, pudding, ice cream, and tomato soup - basically if I try to eat anything other than these self-determined ""safe foods"" I get the sensation that a chunk of food is stuck in my throat and even though I can breath &amp; talk, I get sent into a spiral and I have to calm myself down. I went to an ENT &amp; have an appointment scheduled in 2 weeks for a swallow test but I'm just tired of being limited to the foods mentioned above. On the rare occasion I go out to eat with friends or family, everyone comments that I haven't eaten and it's really getting to me now.

I feel like I need to rant…

I've had random sharp annoying pains on the left side of my chest since Saturday now…  
They come and go as they please with no warning  
and chest sensations are what drive me into overdrive. 

**Scrolling through social media and seeing that a certain athlete or celebrity or anyone YOUNG just randomly passed away drives me INSANE** …every comment comes along with conspiracy theories about the big C syringe that's causing their unexpected death (I got the jab in 2021) and of course, you guys should know that’s the last thing someone with anxiety wants to read

I thought I had my anxiety under control until my recent panic attack... I feel like I’ve gone backward.  
I do counseling and have been to a cardiologist back in June and did EVERY test possible, EKG, stress test, the ultrasound. You name it. and everything came out fine. I go to the gym with no issues I'm pretty serious when it comes down to bodybuilding, except I do get spooked with palpitations now…but the shortness of breath is probably due to me being out of shape lately.

I have a fear of going running now....anything cardio-related SCARES me...even though I did a damn stress test and was practically running on the treadmill.

I had thyroid issues back in April they did detect my t3 and t4 levels were a bit high, but now my thyroid levels are back in control after the medication. I had those sorted out until I developed an allergic reaction to the medication for basically the whole month of September. The medication did cause me to be positive on my ANA antibody test because it caused 'lupus-like' symptoms like joint swelling. but all of that is under control I no longer have that pain.

At the moment my TSH is the only thing that’s SLIGHTLY above the minimum range it should be in. But it has been dropping..

**I NO LONGER GET EXCITED ABOUT THINGS, I GET ANXIOUS AS FUCK**

I absolutely hate that I’m going through this  :( I used to be so full of life and joy and now I sometimes don’t want people to talk while I feel anxious. I’m very uneasy most of the time.

After my 3 year relationship ended 2 years ago, I’ve been trying to get back into the dating game and haven’t had much luck. 
     Long story short, started dating this GREAT guy (26m) about a little more than a month ago, we click great, we have the exact same sense of humor, we’re both students, we’re very similar in personality, he’s genuine and just a genuinely great, sweet guy. But every other day I convince myself that he hates me, or that he’s getting bored with me, or that I’m bothering him, or that he’s not over his ex, or I’m not his type and he wishes I looked different, I look too into what he says, I get insecure. Here’s the kicker…he’s given me literally no reason to think like this. At all. He’s been nothing but affirming and kind and tells me how much he thinks about me and how he wants to spend more time with me and he’s affectionate and we have great conversation and he thinks I’m SO funny (to be fair I am really funny). 
      I’m bad about doing this…I do this with my friends too (I convince myself they dislike me or am annoyed by me). I’m in therapy working through these worries and anxieties…and I have a generalized anxiety and panic disorder…but really this is just anxious thinking. I keep saying dumb shit to this guy like “am I moving in the right direction?” (Meaning towards a relationship because my dumb anxious attachment issues cannot handle “the limbo talking phase”) that’s about the worst damage I’ve done…I refuse to ask for MORE affirmation when someone is already giving me plenty…I just can’t get out of my own head and I’m worried I’m going to fuck this up.

Was on Lexapro for 9 years. It worked great. Zero anxiety, until it pooped out and I started on Zoloft. 

Zoloft doesn’t work nearly as well for anxiety as the Lexapro did for me. I was on 200mg and cut back to 150mg. Zoloft has me feeling jittery and anxious (akathesia). 

What are my options? What else works? I feel like Lexapro was the only good SSRI and now I’m stuck with having to try the ones that don’t work as well.","Lexapro for 9 years, it pooped out now on Zoloft the last 5 months, but doesn’t work as well. Help!"

I am still feeling the palpitations every now and then but it is beating so much slower and I can barely feel my heartbeat which makes a huge change.

2022-11-15 09:46:28,Anxiety,"Hey there.

I'm not a person who excels at school. I don't get panic attacks at school and I don't have any excuses, but I can't decide whether or not I want to go to college. I don't know if I do, I don't know whether I want to go to college and try to take online classes if those are still something you can do, if I want to not go to college, or if I want to try to go to college in person. I'm considering not going or online classes if they're a thing, mostly because I don't think I'd be a good student, as I'm already \*not\* a good student with about a 70 average in my classes and turn in things late (not on purpose, I just forget things easily to anxiety). I don't know what's worth it, getting kicked out of a school because you're not a good student, or not going to college, or going after a year or two. It's just making my entire day worse than it already was. 

For school, I'm trying to get better at handing things in. I don't have an excuse not to, but I don't know why, I just \*can't\* focus on work. I don't think I have anything that could affect my focus, I know I can focus cause I can focus really well in school, but it's different at my house no matter what. If I try to calm myself down, I can't focus. If I try to do the work, I don't know what to write for some of the classes. If I try and focus on something else, I get distracted by it and don't do the work. 

I've always been this way, I never could focus at home and could only focus in school unless it was online work that kept me in my house. That's why I like online school so much; it's not that it was \*good\*, it's that it \*helped me focus\* in its own odd way. 

I also can't focus on doing things that are important, for example, a project in a class I have (creative writing). I had to write a theme. I think of these things normally all the time, but now, I can't. Does anyone know anything that can help at all? I know we can't dictate what I do, but I just... I want some help, any at all.","Friends are talking about colleges, I still haven't had a decision about whether I want to go or not."

It’s like, being told to do them just makes me angrier/more anxious. I hate being aware of my insides and I hate the idea of all my precious useful energy being exhaled into nothingness. I’d rather do one of two things; put my anger/anxious-fueled energy into making art or something tangible, or listen to powerful music like metal or w/e. If it’s a negative kind of emotion that needs to come out, I’d rather do it with less wind chimes and ocean waves aesthetic (Don’t mention metal yoga, I don’t want any classes either.

Never have upped the dose, and I can count on one hand all the times I've taken an extra .25 MG when I was in a super stressful situation the entire time I was prescribed.

They still work fine for me at this dose after all these years, but I've been reading a lot of posts on here about withdrawal and not gonna lie... it has me pretty spooked out. A lot of people don't say what dose they were at when they got off (although I've seen anywhere from 2-6 MG/day)

I don't mind taking it as it helps me, but after all this time I'm obviously dependent on it to some degree and I don't particularly like the idea of that. My dad has been taking 0.5 MG at night for years and he's said that he hasn't had any issues with it if he doesn't take it. My mom has also had a script for Ativan as needed, but she doesn't take it much.  Seems like a mixed bag from what I've been hearing.

This will still take some time though, because i personally want to be off the Xanax first before starting.

These symptoms are ruining my life because i dont know whats what at this point. I will see a neuro in a couple months (love that this was the soonest appointment) . 

Im getting very intense brain shakes (its hard for me to say brain zap because thats not how it feels - it feels like someone took my brain and shook it back and forth real fast) my eyes shake with it, and then my head hurts and feels like another one is building after it . Sometimes its triggered by looking up suddenly or a loud noise. The headache afterwards is either like i described a feeling like its building up again to shake or sometimes feels localized on different parts of my head with just a dull throb.

Then comes the intense dizziness to the point i cannot stand on my feet - this happens while standing in line in any store particularly but happened very bad today while i was cooking dinner - my legs were shaking about to give out , they throb, i feel like im going to pass out, etc

Actually my ribs feel sore as well too, like im constricting them constantly ??

I havent been able to stand in the shower lately - so i sit on the ground and shower and still feel terrible doing that. 

I also have trouble walking - i get very dizzy with heat flashes, feel like i need to sit down, ill have brain zaps etc. Its crazy.

Hello everyone, I hope this post is ok. 

I'm just tired and angry and tired. I have been having constant air hunger for 3 weeks now - sometimes manageable, often so bad i can't do anything else, always gets a lot worse when i try to take a walk or push myself in any way. At my worst, I went to the ER but my bloodwork is fine, so they told me it d worthless to do more exams (even on my own, not at the ER) and sent me home with Xanax/ansiolytics/alprazolam. 

I hsve been taking it since, but it literally does nothing for my air hunger; all it does is... instead of panicking that i feel like I cannot breathe I just lie down somewhere and wait for it to pass.
 Today it was particularly bad, so I took 2x the usual dose, and I still got no effect on the symptom. It didn't even call my panic todayz tbh. But it looks like doctors won't give me anything else really, and this is affecting me so much - I am pushing myself and trying to live as if I'm ok, but it's just so damn hard when I have to keep breathing and yawning every 2 seconds and every small effort makes me feel even worse.

2022-11-14 16:47:19,Anxiety,"So recently I (M,20) have decided that therapy would be a good idea and very much benefit me at my current point in life with anxiety. I've looked into many different Organizations that I could carry out therapy with and I've found one that I like, but my issue is that I don't really have the money. I do have a job at a grocery store but I don't get many shifts and I just started there, and I don't really want to ask for my parents help because I do not want them to know about it and we are not by any means a rich family. was recommended a program by my doctor earlier in the year that was from my recollection free, but when I received a call from someone from said program I didn't have a very pleasant experience. This just made me even more anxious about therapy and held me off until now.

2022-11-14 16:21:52,Anxiety,"I’m not necessarily looking for advice, as much as I am giving it. Although with my predicament I’m more than willing to take any advice anyone can offer. 

I should start by saying that I’m a web developer. I got into web development and coding in general about a year ago when a friend of mine finished a coding boot camp and suggested it to me. I was intrigued and I was looking for a new industry and job to get into anyways because warehousing and assembly is soul crushing. So I pulled out s loan and started to boot camp in January of this year and finished it in April. The job search lasted quite awhile as I was unemployed from April to August when I finally landed my first IT position and my first role as a professional web developer. Good money and good benefits I couldn’t turn down. Ever since I started I came across a HUGE problem. I’m not experienced. Like at all. And I have little knowledge on the technologies we implement on our websites like Vue.js, although the longer I work here, the longer I get used to the way or applications are configured.
Although There’s another pretty big problem. Im they’re only developer. I’m the only person in charge of 8 websites for services that are utilized throughout the Midwest. My role is essentially a senior level position. But they hired me. Someone with not even s full year of experience. I had instructors tell me it’s s bad idea to join s company where you’re their only developer. And I didn’t think anything of it until now. They’re absolutely right. It was a bad idea. I have really bad imposter syndrome.
“Do I really know what I’m doing here?” I tell myself daily. “Is today the day they realize I’m a complete fraud? Do they already know I’m a fraud and they’re just waiting to catch me in the act to point out how much I don’t know and fire me on the spot?” These thoughts keep me up at night. I’m glad that I only go into the office for work celebrations like our IT appreciation day and work from home instead. The projects keep me up as well. I can’t stop thinking about how to fix the problem I have with a project it’s hard for me to stop and get into relax mode after work. 

Tl;dr If you can work in person, try. It’s harder to go into leisure mode after work when ou work from home, in my personal experience. Otherwise, please be careful and make sure you have time to relax and you separate yourself from work after 8 hours of working. Although I think if you’re feeling exhausted anyways, make sure you take breaks. And take a walk outside. We all need a little bit of outside every now and then.",I am an inexperienced developer in a highly experienced developer role and it’s crushing.

2022-11-14 14:50:21,Anxiety,"My home has always been a rocky experience. 

I feel like there are way too many bad memories that I just can't stop thinking about over and over again. Now don't get confused, my parents love and care for me. However, the relationship between them was not healthy at all. There were always fights between them every day, in the car, during holidays, vacations, restaurants, and at home. They recently divorced after a violent 30 years together.

I moved to college around 4 months ago and honestly, I feel less anxious than how I was back at my old house. The holidays are coming up and my dad wants me to stay over for a week with him because he does not want to be alone for thanksgiving. Thing is... I can't go back.  Every single time I think of me visiting the old home I get on the verge of a panic attack. There are way too many bad memories that I do not wish to recall. It is odd since I have been told that it can't be a sign of PTSD even though I have flashbacks of my parents screaming and when I had my worst depressive and panic attack episodes. I can't even see pictures of my old room without getting flooded with undesired memories. There are good memories but it seems that the negative ones outweigh the positive ones. I am embarrassed telling my dad why I don't want to go back to visit because he will think it is idiotic to have that mindset. Perhaps he is right, but I can't change that. 

I wish to not be chased by the past anymore; however, it finds ways to follow me when I think I am free. I love my parents but I don't love my home. There was a point where it was my safe space. Not anymore. Too many bad things happened there and I want to stop getting these flashbacks from affecting my present life. 

My mental health has had detrimental effects because of past events and even if it sounds selfish, I want to improve my mental well-being, even if it means being critiqued by my dad on how I exaggerate things. However, I do not know how to tell him.",I miss my home but I can't go back

I'm a 22 year old gay male, and I just recently moved states at the beginning of the year with nothing but a box of clothes and a pc. I've been rebuilding my life from the ground up all year, but I just feel so so so alone and vulnerable. There are too many instances and too many people who have taken direct advantage of me for me to even have the energy to list off. It just feels like every win for me is another opportunity for someone to take advantage of. I get money? Someone's gonna use me for money. I lose 120 lbs (290 &gt; 170 6'3m) and people manipulate me emotionally to take advantage of me sexually. I haven't felt a real human connection ever. I've never been in a genuine relationship where someone has told me they loved me and meant it. I feel like I've done everything right and the only people that give me the time of day are the people who know they can use me to get what they want. 

So I sit inside all day, anxious to go out and do anything. Anxious to get up and go to work even though I put in 60 hour weeks, unmotivated to play anything. I'm seeing two therapists trying to get better and nothing seems to be working. I feel so broken from being taken advantage of so many times. There's more pain than I could ever put in a reddit post. 

Is it even normal to be this anxious all the time? My body feels physically heavy, and I have to force myself to get out of bed and do ANYTHING. I can't focus on anything, my vision is always blurry, I'm always short of breath, and I get jittery and shaky often.","everyone has taken advantage of me (financially, emotionally, physically, sexually) and now I just go to work or sit home bombarded with constant anxiety."

Some I pushed away myself but many chose to distance themselves first. 

After getting a new job a few months ago and thinking things were looking brighter, workload became too much, bullying was a regular occurrence and I lost all of the tiny fragment of confidence I had managed to build up. I was expendable and after a breakdown and psychiatric visit was sent on sickleave for 2 weeks. I will now return in an hour. Been having nothing but nightmares and loss of sleep over it, real messed up dreams too... 

I shouldn't be wasting my time complaining on a subreddit but I don't know what to do.

I do breathing exercises regularly and have been in and out of therapy since before I was a teenager (around 30 today).

2022-11-14 13:43:11,Anxiety,"Im gonna try to keep this as short as possible but also want it all to make sense. 

I was in a relationship for just over four years that ended suddenly in October of 2021. We were a foster home and my now ex caused harm to a child in our care while I was at work.  My ex totally changed as a person and suddenly became very abusive. In hindsight our relationship was on a long, slow decline. He contributed very little to the household which left most of the responsibilities on me on top of working full time and attending college online in the evenings. 

The children (one of which we had from birth to 18 months) were removed immediately and I never had the chance to say goodbye. We owned a home together that I basically just signed over because he wouldn't cooperate with selling it. All the friends I had where we lived were also his so I lost all of my support. 

I started counseling earlier this year, worked through most if this, and got to a place where both I and my counselor thought I no longer needed go continue services. 

In October I was subpoenaed to testify against my ex. I knew this would eventually be coming. Over the few weeks before trial my anxiety sky rocketed, which I was not surprised by obviously. 

Testifying was a lot easier than I expected and he was found guilty of the charges. I expected to find some kind of relief after having the closure of everything that happened and in some ways I have. However my anxiety is still higher than it has ever been. 

I have a constant feeling of uneasiness. My gag reflex is over the top constantly (this happened in high stress situations in the past as well) and the only way to keep it at bay is chewing gum all day. I am also majorly over thinking things. Again, this is normal for me but its so extreme right now. Its to the point that I feel like its starting to affect my current relationship. 

I've considered doing another intake for counseling but the person I was seeing has moved and I don't feel like there is really anything to talk about that I havent already worked through. Theres the added complication that I dont have insurance and my income has increased since my first intake so I will no longer be able to utilize the sliding scale.

All of my life I've been having trouble falling asleep. Recently, I've been having bad dreams. Not always scary, but always unsettling and making me feel sad when I wake up. The other night I woke up hallucinating that a huge face was coming towards me and it triggered my fight or flight cos I failed my arms at it, and then had a panick attack believing Freddy Krueger was real.
On top of that, for months now I've been waking up miserable due to having to live through another day, just to go to bed to battle alone in the dark with my fears.
All night long I've been scared that if I close my eyes something bad will happen, a scary ghost will appear and jumpscare me, or I'll open my eyes and I won't be in this reality anymore. Reciting my bedtime speech ritual thing (I swear it's an OCD compulsion) over and over again didn't work. Naturally, I tried music, tik tok, water, putting small lights on, nothing worked. As it got later I was just feeling worse.
After sitting on my bathroom floor crying and shaking, all I wanted to do was to sleep with my cat in my bed because being alone is feeling painful right now, but he scratches at my furniture which is stressful so I had to kick him out again.

He’s now married and looks very happy and in love with his beautiful, gorgeous wife who I happen to have gone to high school with for a brief time. He ghosted me and it wrecked my life for a full year. It’s a heartbreak that for whatever reason still pops up in my head from time to time, despite me dating him for only a mere 3 months max. 

I just ended a 6 and a half year relationship a few months ago because it was going no where. He disrespected me by looking at other women, being sneaky and god knows what else. I’m now 27 and live back with my parents feeling lost.

I think I cared about my ex, but deep down knew it wasn’t love I felt but more so a familiarity type of feeling. I just happened to have gotten used to him. We had nothing in common. 

The only way I’m able to sleep and shut my mind down is if I visualize myself stepping out of my body. I’m looking at myself lay in bed and immediately feel a sense of relief. I think about how her (my) problems aren’t “my” problems. I look at her “me” and think well she can handle it, I think she’ll be okay.

I’ve suffered with anxiety and depression my whole life but after I had my daughter in 2020, my anxiety spiraled out of control. I have been able to keep it under control until here recently. I had a spot on my back I wanted to get checked out because it didn’t feel right and it ended up being cancer. Thankfully they were able to remove it but it was still the “trust your gut” anxiety that did it for me or else I wouldn’t have. Fast forward a few months and I started having these weird chest pains. A very dull pain but still in the left side of my sternum which is a cause for concern since heart disease runs in my family. I ignored it for the first few weeks, anxiety wasn’t happening, but as of the past two weeks, the panic really hit hard.

Nothing changed in my symptoms but the thoughts of “I’m dying and I am going to leave my daughter behind” started and took me into a dark place. I scheduled a doctors appointment, she checked me out saying it was probably muscle spasms, and increased my anxiety medication to the next step up. She also ran some bloodwork which I am waiting to hear back on.

After increasing my meds, I do feel better but the intrusive thoughts are still running through my head. I’m tired of being a damn hypochondriac. I am a grown ass woman and I should have my mental shit under control but god I feel so alone.",Health anxiety is destroying my life

So after a lot of research I decided to get one knowing it would be hard work but would provide my life with some stability and love.

Now that I have him I have never been more anxious. The thought of going to work and leaving him alone makes me sick. I wake up early before work to feed, play and take him for a poo. Then when I leave I have to crate him so he doesn't chew on everything, I have a camera to watch him and he screams the entire time. I tried crate training him slowly every day but he has become so attached to me that leaving him for any time upsets him so much. I come home during my lunch break to play and potty but even that doesn't seem to help.

So I spend all day checking up on him with the camera and it's only making it worse. I have that in the evenings when we are together he is the perfect dog. He's so kind and helps soothe my own anxiety but I can't shake the guilt that while he tries his best to support me, I am failing him.

This subreddit has helped me out alot, i thought i would give my two cents on an ongoing thing i suffer from. 

 i had my first panic attack in a car driving in the middle of nowhere, i was with my girlfriend at the time and i suddenly felt as if i were loosing consciousness, my whole body felt as if it went into shock. I sat in the passenger seat in the front of the car and my arms were tingling, like a very intense 'pins and needles' sensation all up and down my arms, difficulty breathing and the feeling like i am about to drop dead and my brain is going to turn off. i was on the phone to 999 straight away and they told me i should head to the nearest hospital asap or get an ambulance sent out, they said it was a 7 hour wait until an ambulance and i thought this was the end for me, but i eventually calmed down and felt decently normal to continue the journey after reading online it was a severe panic attack. 

Ever since this has happened i have not been the same person, i have lost my spark as a human being and i am constantly anxious and live in paranoia, i spoke to my local GP about this however he told me everything is okay and prescribed me with 40MG Of Propranolol, these help to a certain extent but never get rid of it. I genuinely constantly have the overwhelming sensation of doom or impending death, i have it constantly and it has gotten to the point where i am afraid to leave my house in case i die, but then i get moments of realisation, as if my old self it trying to push through and tell me everything is okay.

The best way to describe how it feels is as if you become very very very self aware of yourself and your body, your mind then begins to play tricks on you and convince you that something bad is happening, this is your fight or flight response. Every single slight thing that happens to you, you will feel, get a sore head? you convince yourself you have a tumour or brain cancer and you are about to die and it is all about to switch off.. Difficulty catching your breath? you begin to feel like you will never ever breathe again, it sets you into a total panic and you begin to feel like your sunset is upon you, it is not.. you are okay.

What i have found that helps me out is just riding it out, do not fight it. You are okay. i let myself pace around till i can eventually ground myself and sit down, then when i am comfortable i will lay in a fetal position and try to take my mind off of the situation by playing a game on my phone, or watching tiktok, i usually calm down within 15 mins

I am alot better now, i don't get them as often as i did which was a good few times a day, i had my first one in about a week and a half just last night. Please do not let this consume you.",You're not dying. (Panic attacks and Anxiety attacks thread.)

2022-11-14 09:09:42,Anxiety,"I'm a new university student in my first semester. My senior year of high school was good, I was the guy at my school, I'm a university level athlete and was offered a scholarship to play football. I was offered about a year a half ago. But this year I've been diagnosed with C-PTSD (complex PTSD), this is all due to my childhood and me seeing some messed up things for the past 8 years of my childhood and teenage years. I grew up in a single parent household with 3 other brothers, I'm the middle child and had to be an adult growing up. My mother was addicted to multiple levels of drugs and wsa involved in dealing them. As a child I was forced to grow up, my older brother was only two years older than me but he is selfish and never cared for anyone but himself. I had to make dinner every night, make sure everyone was up in the morning, went to bed at night, all while my mother didn't help and only added to the list of things to do and screamed in our faces everyday if we didn't do what she wanted to her liking. Now I'm medicated for my anxiety, which manifests its own way, like seizures, manic episodes, visual and auditory hallucinations, and the occasional panic and anxiety attack. I feel anxiety 24/7, in highschool I was lucky enough to see a psychologist once a week for about 7 months until I left for university. The reason for my ptsd to come up this year was cause I moved out of my mothers into my now ex girlfriends place. They are amazing people, upper middle class and served me three square meals a day, got me clothes, a phone and a phone plan, shoes and everything they would do if I was one of their children. As grateful as I am for that, me being outside of my mothers home and seeing what normal is like, resulted in the ptsd episodes to manifest. I dated that girlfriend up until last month which could be a whole post on its own. But now, I feel as alone as ever but I also wanted to be alone, I had to take a medical leave from football because how bad it became. Every action I take seems to cause a breakdown of me, any sound makes me jump. Recently I've been thinking about unaliving myself, although i'm too scared to do it, I just want all the pain to stop. I've worked so hard to be in my position, yet i'm in the worst mental state in my life right now. I just don't know how to deal with it all,  I know you guys arn't medical professionals, but I feel as though I'm so alone in my situation. What type of things do you guys do on a day to day basis to avoid having extreme anxiety? I workout, play video games, picked up a couple hobbies cause I have so much free time, yet it seems to be all in vain some times.",My new found anxiety seems to be crippling
2022-11-14 09:08:43,Anxiety,"Maybe I'm making this post because the end of the year is approaching and it's definitely a time for reflection for me and a lot of people. Sometimes I wonder if I have vicarious trauma (otherwise known as secondhand trauma, when you're witnessing a tragedy on your phone or TV)

Because seriously, like a lot of people, I feel like I fell into a spiral of ""doom-scrolling"" back in February and March. When there was nothing but non-stop 24/7 Eastern Europe (I can't say the ""U"" word or my post will be removed) war news that terrified everyone and spiked the world's anxiety.

I don't even check Eastern Europe war news anymore, but my point is that looking back, I consumed way too much of all that horrific, anxiety inducing war info our human brains aren't even meant to handle (especially after two years of an already stressful pandemic).

With that said, I'm making some major changes in 2023, and I'm absolutely done with the trauma porn. At this point, whatever shit happens in the world next year, I selfishly can't be bothered to invest myself in it anymore, for the sake of my own sanity. I'll probably hear about horrific world events from a friend or family member anyway. But as far as getting consumed like I did in February and March? That's the last time.",Does anyone else feel like they consumed way too much war info back in Feb/March? It was absolutely non-stop doom and gloom.
2022-11-14 09:08:33,Anxiety,"I have so much anger, resentment and sadness right now. Single mom. Worked really hard to raise my two kids completely on my own. But worked really hard for my dependence and broke up from a very codependent relationship with someone a year ago.

 I recently arranged and curated an art exhibition and one of the artists i invited who lives in another town asked if he could stay with me if he flies to town for the exhibition. I thought it would just be for the weekend. Told him he’s welcome but my two kids and I live in a small apartment so he’s welcome to either sleep on the couch or stay in my small art studio that’s 5km away but that there’s no bath/shower in the studio. He arrived yesterday and now i hear he’s here for 10 days! He’s also now asked if he could rather come sleep in the apartment from next week instead of travelling here to shower. My kids are both currently writing exams. I am under so much work pressure myself. Tried to work in my studio today but can’t focus with him there. And now i seem unable to sleep tonight. I don’t know how I’m going to get through this week. I know he’s seeing it as a career networking opportunity and even though I am far from well off I earn more than he does but i feel a little bit taken advantage of. And also angry at myself for not being more boundaried - I’ve already offered to take him on outings two days next week and he then asked if I could also take him to some event the one evening and i sheepishly agreed to that too but now I regret it. 

I am annoyed with myself for finding myself in this situation AND now I’m going to be sleep deprived tomorrow too.","Past 3am and I can’t sleep because of anger, resentment, frustration and more"
2022-11-14 09:05:29,Anxiety,"I have been with my fiance for 4.5 years. Engaged for 1 year. We live together. We are in our mid to late 20s.

I have always had relationship anxiety. I've always had general anxiety for as long as I can remember. My anxiety tends to focus on the thing that's most important to me. So when I started my relationship, it focused on my relationship. My relationship anxiety got worse after we experienced a rough patch about 9 months ago that was VERY close to ending our relationship. We are all good now. Happier than ever (as a couple). But the rough patch messed me up. I guess anytime our relationship is less than perfect, I get super scared. 

I am on an SSRI and in therapy. Both help, but I do still struggle. 

Every single thing my fiance does gives me anxiety. EVERY SINGLE THING. And 99% of the time, I don't think it's warranted. These are the things that give me anxiety:

\- If he's quiet / not talking (he's not ignoring me, just sitting scrolling through his phone or something)

\- If he's not talking on a car ride

\- If he gets slightly annoyed at me

\- The tone of his voice - if he doesn't sound EXTREMELY enthusiastic all the time, I think he's mad at me

\- If he's frustrated about something else  completely unrelated to me or our relationship (I somehow think that he's overly frustrated because I'm in his life - I know it doens't make sense)

\- When I say I love you and he says it back, I over-analyze the tone of his voice and how he says it

\- When I bring up our upcoming wedding, I analyze how excited he sounds

\- I analyze every single maneurism, eye movement, tone of his voice, etc. 

You get the idea. Literally EVERYTHING I over-analyze. I then I make a story up in my head that he no longer loves me or wants to me with me and convince myself that's true. Then every single thing he does, I try to find proof that's the case. For example, today we were playing a new video game together. He was quiet during the game and I was convinced that meant that he feels awkward with me and isn't having fun with me. And then the entire game was not enjoyable because I was so sure that he wasn't having fun with me. 

He has social anxiety and is a huge introvert. So when we are out in public, he tends to be quiet and a bit reserved. I always think this is an indication that he isn't happy with me. 

I HATE this. It's ruining my life. This should be the happiest moment in my life. But instead of being excited for our wedding in a few months, I am convinced he doesn't want to be with me. I am so convinced that I think everything he does is a sign that he isn't happy. I google signs that he isn't happy, and if I look hard enough I can see all of the signs (none of them are obvious signs - I REALLY have to look hard). But once I see something in him, I can't unsee it. 

Anyone with a similar experience? What the hell do I do????

And then there's part of me that thinks ""what if this isn't anxiety and is actually my gut telling me something ?""",Anxiety is making me absolutely miserable in my relationship / having doubts
2022-11-14 08:58:43,Anxiety,"Okay, so I am 20 years old. I’ve been suffering from anxiety since a child. Panic attacks started controlling my life at about 13. Just for a little background, I grew up in a really unstable abusive household with an alcoholic father. I also have genetic predispositions to anxiety/depression. It’s on both sides of my family (heavily lmao). So I can understand where my anxiety is from and why/how it has formed. However, it is ruining my life. Ive had periods where im okay, feeling positive and hopeful even but then theres times where i’m completely losing it with relentless god awful panic. 

I am in therapy currently &amp; felt for a couple months I was finally starting to get a handle on things. Ive been practicing mindfulness and breathing, journaling, debating my toxic scary thoughts, getting out of the house more etc. but then about 2 weeks ago, I had a really bad panic attack which feels like it pushed me back to square one. Ever since then Ive been having multiple panic attacks a day. My panic attacks bring on an intense feeling of derealization (feeling like nothing is real), racing thoughts, fear of going crazy, pounding heart, sweating, shaking, vomiting, crying, and full body numbness. When i’m in this state I feel like I will be stuck there forever and that’s a horrible feeling. Once its over I just find myself worrying about the next one which triggers them over and over again which also leads to a cycle of not sleeping or eating which you know it, fuels it more lol. 

I am so incredibly scared of these panic attacks and i’m so worried that this will be my life forever. I can’t function when I am in these really anxious periods. Ive lost jobs, dropped out of high school, ended relationships, abused substances all just to run from this feeling which I know is not healthy at all. Now that Ive become aware of my avoidance and toxic patterns through therapy, Ive realized I spent my entire life running and avoiding anxiety which then lead me to completely lose myself. Facing it head on has been one of the most difficult things Ive ever done but I will continue trying because its either this or being stuck here forever.

2022-11-14 08:34:31,Anxiety,"As the tittle says, I (27F) have been having multiple panic attacks for no reason, this began 2 weeks ago and came out of nowhere after a shopping day with my mom. The last time I had a panic attack was 13 years ago so I don’t know why it is happing now, I’m not even sure if these are panic attacks or a more serious condition. 

I suddenly feel like my heart rate goes up and I’m hyperventilating, the most annoying symptom is feeling like my head is disconnecting from my body. I use an Apple Watch but when I track my heart rate, it’s normal, it’s not even in the highest range of normal, it’s just normal. I feel dizzy but I’m not dizzy, it’s this annoying feel in my head that doesn’t go away, as if I was stoned or something, on the verge of fainting or dying. I’m not a native English speaker so I have trouble explaining what it is, but I usually describe it as if my soul is leaving my body, as if my head is not connected to my body, it’s so annoying. 

As I previously said, there’s no reason for me to be this anxious or this stressed, I sleep 7 hours at night and… I really don’t know what’s going on, this has happened 3 times already but lasts the whole day, and the feel in my head just intensifies time to time until I fall asleep. I told the doctor about this and I was prescribed drugs for anxiety, but I’m really not feeling anxious. 

I was diagnosed with OCD 13 years ago and I’ve been dealing with it since then, there have been times where it became unbearable but never caused panic attacks as the ones I’m dealing with now, has anyone expedited something like this?

2022-11-14 08:00:25,Anxiety,"Basically what's written in the title.

I live in an apartment complex where a neighbour knocks on our door (I live with my mom) and ask for money.
He also doesn't accept a no, he halves the amount he wants (first wants 20€ if I say no he says ok but you sure have 10€ he asks).

Last week he asked for money, after me saying no he went away and came back again the same day. I have never given him money. The second time he came to my door I was still shaking from my previous panicking (couldn't stop my thoughts, and was catastrophizing what if he stops my mom intimidating her forcing her to give him money, she is very old and weak), still opened the door and took all my courage together and said he has to stop asking me for money. He went away.

Other neighbours came to my door and complaint that he also asks them a lot. We all signed a letter to our landlord about this matter.

Now I'm afraid and completely lost my inner peace and I'm shaking inside. In case he gets a warning from the landlord, he will be angry with me and will maybe come after me, because him coming to my door started a process of collecting complaints about him.

I'm constantly thinking about it, the nights (it's after midnight where I live) are the worst. It's also getting dark earlier which makes me more anxious and insecure, because we use the same entrance 😔

2022-11-14 07:50:30,Anxiety,"I have had anxiety on and off for the past 10 years. Luckily, it's been more off than on, but it is still always there at least a little bit, in the background. My anxiety often becomes bad during stressful periods, but it always manifests as an obsession with my heart and a fear that it will stop. 

Since the pandemic, I've had three very nasty, very acute episodes. I refer to these simply as ""breakdowns"". I know that's not a term used much these days, but it's exactly what they feel like. During these breakdowns I become absolutely obsessed with my heart rate, and I will constantly (and I really do mean constantly) check my pulse and tap it out with my fingers. I will lie in bed for days, barely sleeping, just sweating, worrying, and checking my pulse. I feel like I literally ""break down"" from a human being into just a lump of anxiety, sweat, and obsession.

The first of these happened during a period of lockdown. I was going into work every day, but there was almost no one else in the building, and no one on the streets as I walked to work, and eventually this wore me down. The work stressed me out, but there were no real live human beings around me to console me. I completely broke down in the manner described above, and I had to have a few days off work.

The next breakdown was last spring. I was on holiday with my girlfriend, and I got a bit of stomach bug. I started worrying about the speed of my heart (likely just raised by the sickness), and then I completely broke down again. It ruined half of the holiday, as we spent our days trapped in hotel rooms while I freaked out. In the taxi to the airport I had a horrible panic attack, but after boarding the plane my anxiety thankfully began to subside and I was able to sleep.

After this I started seeing a therapist who I found extremely helpful. I also began running. This is something I've been very frightened off, as I dislike the feeling of my heart beating quickly and I worry that I will have a sudden cardiac arrest (this is despite being repeatedly told by doctors and paramedics that my heart is healthy and my blood pressure is excellent). So I started by just running 1 minute a week, with my partner. By the end of the summer I was running to work and back every day, all by myself, and going for 40 minute runs by myself on the weekends.

I felt great, and thought my anxiety was over for good.

But of course it wasn't. This autumn, my partner and I took a career break to go travelling. But unfortunately, within the first few days of travelling I got a nasty fever. I was almost over the worst of it when I started panicking while on a bus. This spiralled out of control and I went into breakdown mode again. We spent a week in a hotel room while I freaked out, and made three trips to the local medical centre. We decided to go home, and having dosed up on some xanax that the local doctors gave me, I was able to fly back.

A few weeks later we tried to have another go at travelling again, but sadly my anxiety started to come back within a week. I barely slept for two days, and at the risk of the anxiety getting worse and me going into full breakdown mode, we decided to come home again.

We have wasted £1000s on cancelled hotels and flights. But more importantly, my anxiety has caused me to miss the opportunity to do something I had been looking forward to immensely. Travelling is one of the things I most enjoy, and in the past I would often find my anxiety to be almost nonexistent during it. But now I'm worried I won't be able to do it again, that my anxiety has ruined it forever. I'm nearing 30, and perhaps will never again get this opportunity to go travelling for a few months, and it makes me incredibly depressed to think that my anxiety has fucked this all up. 

Recently, I've been reading about the ideas of Dr Claire Weekes, the DARE response, and Acceptance Commitment Therapy, and this has led me to the conclusion that the correct approach is to learn to accept my anxiety. To not struggle against it or away from it, but to just let it be. To just observe the symptoms, without trying to stop them or wish them away. 

The problem I have with this is that it is difficult for me to accept the symptoms of anxiety. The reason for this is that my anxiety is specifically centered around the heart. 

I am terrified that my heart will stop. I'm also aware that anxiety can damage your cardiovascular system, and it's certainly not unheard of to hear people say that a person died from heart attack brought on by stress. So if anxiety makes my heart race, how can I just accept this? If anxiety is bad for my heart, then worrying about anxiety damaging it isn't simply the result of an anxious delusion, and therefore how can I fully accept my anxiety? To do so would require forcing myself to believe that anxiety isn't something worrying. But if anxiety is bad for my heart, then it IS something worrying, so to accept that it isn't would be to believe an untruth. But I can't just believe an untruth, however much I want to, because like most people I believe things because they seem to me to be true. When a friend of mine died I didn't want to believe it, but that didn't stop me from believing it. So how can I escape the loop of worrying about my anxiety, when I know that my worrying is somewhat relevant to the facts? 

The other problem I have is that these breakdowns always come with sleeplessness. 

Gathering the fortitude to maintain an attitude of acceptance towards anxiety is difficult when well rested, but after two days of not sleeping there is barely any fortitude left to muster. I simply do not have the focus or equanimity to keep convincing myself that I just need to accept the anxiety. My emotions are swinging all over the place and I feel absolutely saturated with adrenaline and cortisol. There is so much noise in my head that if there is still a calm, rational inner voice speaking, then I've no chance of hearing it. 

The other problem is that I'm aware that not sleeping is bad for you, and can also cause damage to the cardiovascular system. So now not only do I find myself worrying about the damage the anxiety is doing to my heart, but also the sleepless nights. I can try to accept all this by telling myself that there's nothing to worry about, that it's ""just"" tiredness and anxiety, but when there are pop-science bestselling books such as ""Why We Sleep"" screaming at us about the dangers of not getting enough sleep, it's difficult to really believe myself. 

So the loop becomes impossible to escape, as I become more tired and therefore more anxious, and therefore more unable to sleep, and therefore yet more anxious, and therefore more worried about the damage the anxiety and sleeplessness is doing to my body, and therefore more anxious again, and therefore yet more unable to sleep, and therefore more worried that the lack of sleep and high anxiety will eventually cause me to keel over and die, and so on.

I realise that to overcome my fears, I need to face them. This I suppose would mean attempting to go travelling yet again and when I become anxious just accepting the anxious feelings and letting them pass. But in our first attempt, we spent a week waiting for my anxiety to pass, and it didn't. We even moved to a different hotel, to see if the change of scenery would help. Each night I would try to sleep, but because I knew that I needed to sleep to get over the anxiety, this pressure meant I wouldn't be able to, and so I'd suffer another sleepless night. I couldn't just ""accept"" that I might not sleep, by telling myself it would be fine even if I didn't, because I knew that it actually wouldn't be, because I knew I needed to sleep. I don't understand how I am supposed to convince myself about something that I know isn't true.

I know that one answer might be that I shouldn't ""wait for my anxiety to pass"", because I should just continue on in the same way I would if the anxiety wasn't there, while accepting the anxious symptoms and allowing them to be present. But for the reasons specified above, I can't accept my anxious symptoms, because I can't lie to myself. I can't tell myself that the symptoms are ""just"" feelings and they're nothing to worry about, because I'm aware that people actually can die from stress and that anxiety actually is bad for your heart. 

The other worry I have is that if the only way to get passed this is to go travelling, let myself have one of these breakdowns, and allow it to fuck me up until I come out the other side, then I'm putting my body through a lot of strain by doing this. A week of little sleep and constant anxiety is exhausting, and surely I may very well be putting myself in danger by forcing myself to go through this.

So I just don't see how I can get out of this, and I feel increasingly depressed because anxiety is stopping me from travelling, which is something I have always loved.",I feel like my anxiety is a loop that I can't possibly escape from

I already got off benzos which control these, I only take them now as needed. I’m afraid if this continues I’ll need to be on them again not that my experience is actually bad but I’m already on the phase of improving and tapering off meds. 

This made me realize, I actually still fear my triggers. My solution after breaking down then was to get the triggers off my life and I was successful.

I am chunky and short. We are polar opposites, people are surprised we are even related.

She was all dressed up in a dress and looked beautiful, everyone was complimenting her. As was I dressed up too but I didn't get anything of course. I am the ugly sister, daughter and friend. Had a great aunt come up to her to tell her she lit up the whole room with her smile and beauty, then my great aunt looked over at me and smiled. I am fat, and yes I could work out but that's beside the point right now. I thought beauty was subjective? If it was subjective then why did my counselor tell me that men would be intimated to come up to me if she was around. If *SOME* men didn't find her attractive why don't they come up to me? That's right, cause I don't believe in ""subjective beauty"" I believe in settling, and that's the only time I will ever find someone if they are willing to settle. I am convinced that the matches I get online are the ones using the number method because no woman swipes right so they chill, and talk to the fat overweight plain Jane that has self esteem issues that they don't actually find attractive.""I am surprised you are single"" LOL, no you aren't. I posted a photo of us on here, and guess who the guys chose? *hint* not me. That hurt, cause I got told to stand away from her and maybe men would come up to me.

2022-11-13 16:19:29,Anxiety,"It’s been a few months but I still think about it often. I woke up, went to school, and when I came back, there were happy birthday decorations up on the porch that my mom set up. I have pretty bad anxiety and idk, I thought something like, “this might be an annoyance for the neighbors”. I don’t know why. I just get so nervous at any public thing, but hell, this wasn’t even that public. I don’t even think any of my neighbors were outside. Still, I acted like an idiot and panicked. I put my hoodie up and ran up to the door as fast as I could. Another thing I hate is my pictures taken, I don’t think I’ve had my picture taken in at least 3 years. 

When I got to the porch, the door was locked and I panicked and started twisting the door a bunch. I don’t know why I reacted this way, it wasn’t a big deal, it’s supposed to be a good thing. When I realized this wouldn’t work, I turned around and my mom was there was her phone camera out. I panicked even harder and quite literally became an idiot and tried opening a locked door without the key. Getting to a point where the door was just shaking because of my dumb panic.

My mom got angry at me and said something along the lines of “last time I try to do something nice for you, don’t have to be so bitchy” and idk, that broke the dam. I liked the decorations, I was just anxious and acted like an asshole. I just ran up to my room and started crying. Took me a few hours to calm down and make it look like I didn’t cry. I went downstairs for a minute, to see what was going on. I’m pretty sure my mom had cried too. I felt like shit. I decided to go get something to drink when I noticed all the decorations were tore down from the porch and were on the kitchen floor near the garbage. They weren’t taken down nicely either, some letters were ripped and stuff like that. That just made me turn around and go back upstairs to cry some more.

2022-11-13 15:39:06,Anxiety,"Hello again! It's just me, being paranoid and hoping for some reassurance that I won't die in my sleep or something.  TW for allergies, just in case... I'm still not sure how this stuff works.

For some context, I'm allergic to cashews and pistachios, avoid nuts in general a lot of the time because of cross contamination, and this has been a point of major anxiety for me over the years.  If I look sideways at a nut I start worrying I'm having a reaction.

Anyhoo, I do love Merci chocolates, especially milk chocolate with hazelnut pieces.  I've eaten them before with absolutely no problems ever.  Tonight I got a box and had exactly one of the hazelnut chocolate candies, and soon after I developed a tickle in my throat.  Coughing and clearing it didn't help, just made it feel strained, and neither did drinking water.  I assumed it was a piece of hazelnut that just got caught, but nothing makes it go away.  That was around 9-10 PM and it's currently 1:30 AM, and the tickle hasn't gotten worse but hasn't subsided at all.  It's mostly annoying.  But somewhere along the way I started freaking out that this is an allergic reaction to the hazelnuts, or more correctly cross contamination with another nut.  I'm having no other symptoms except my raging anxiety. 

Not asking for any kind of medical advice, mostly just a ""reason"" I can blame this on so my brain will stop worrying.  My breathing is fine and has been the whole time, and my family is on hand in case it does turn out to be an emergency.  But is it possible that I could have gotten a piece of hazelnut stuck and it either could still be stuck or irritated my throat enough it's still bothering me?

2022-11-13 15:27:42,Anxiety,"Ever since I was little I've always felt different and not quite normal like everybody else when it comes to sex and kissing and all that stuff but I didn't know until I was 26 that I was asexual or on the Spectrum should I say. So back when I was an older teenager I met this guy and to keep a long story short I got attached to him pretty damn hard if that made anysense and he fell for me. I started moving things in the direction of possibly a relationship but then I quickly backed off and left him high and dry because I wouldn't sleep with him or have sex. But never told him that because I didn't know what was going on with me all those years of my life and why I was the way I was until as I said I was 26. 

So we stopped talking for many years and I never lost that feeling for him the kind of feeling where I want to spend my life with him holding his hand maybe cuddling talking all the time like we used to for hours on the phone even all night once but that's it. None of the real sexual stuff you know. So fast forward to back in September he came back into my life and wanted to ask me a question that's been bothering him for years which was why did I do what I did? 

I gladly answered him and apologized for everything and explained everything he told me he wasn't the best person either back then and said I can absolutely have his forgiveness. Then he and I talked about maybe trying to become friends again so we did and it's been great so far. Now I feel I should add he's in a relationship he's being with her for 7 years and is now engaged. I am so happy for them and I wish them nothing but the best of life and do not want to do anything to hurt her or him or get between them. All that being said I almost made a huge mistake today. 

Because whenever I talk to him I get very vulnerable and I feel like I can share anything with him things I won't even tell my own family about myself. And well I thought about telling him how I feel just to get it off my chest you know and let it out of my system?! So I went about it like this I asked him without directly telling him. If there were things you wanted to tell someone but you knew it wouldn't change anything do you a) tell them ne ways or (Please no judgments I know it sounds very stupid what I said and I'm embarrassed by it but I said it and I can't take it back.) b) write a note to them and then send it off on a Ballon up into the sky never to be seen again and them never knowing. 

He said to tell them I said would not hurt the person's partner and he said only if the person left their partner for it. And this is when I started getting an extreme amount of anxiety and panic over me wanting to tell him my feelings and I expressed that to him. He then said it sounds like you're in love with someone and it scares you because part of you doesn't want to know the answer if the other person feels the same I said you sure and he said least from what you described. He said he's being in a similar situation and can explain when he gets home he promised smiley face I then said okay cuz I don't know what's wrong with me. I then said I feel like I need/want something and then once it gets all to real I panic and get severe anxiety. 

To which he said nothing is wrong with you it sounds like worry and love to me. After that I said okay I'm freaking over here and I hate this because let me tell you the freaking anxiety and panic was so bad. He said okay I got to get back to work and told me to breathe until he gets home and he would help me he promised again. But then never messaged me back and I don't know after calming down a lot but still having a bit of the panic and anxiety that I want to continue the conversation and feel like that all over again. It was so intense. 

But please share with me do you think what he said is true that it really means I'm in love because I can't tell those kinds of things when it comes to myself. It's a part of stuff that goes on in myself along with other things a psychiatrist once told me when I did this evaluation thing many years ago to see what kind of learning disability I had and other stuff about me like I see things in black and white not literally but figuratively that kind thing etc. So if anyone can share their thoughts on this I appreciate it and please be kind ot goes along away.",terrified and full of anxiety plus panic help.

It's very visceral, like a feeling of terror that seizes my body and beats in my stomach. I've removed the cause/ trigger from my life (a relationship I was in and which taking a distance from always removed the anxiety in the past), but now, since I've cut all contact, the anxiety has remained and even skyrocketed. I try everything; I attempt deep breaths (initially very difficult with a racing heart) with my hand on my belly, try to ""observe"" my anxiety, to accept it, to ignore it, to talk to it, I even do certain yoga pauses, I take a valerian tablet, I get up from bed and walk around.

2022-11-13 14:15:00,Anxiety,"(22 y/o male) This is going to be sort of a long post. I have talked to a couple doctors about my anxiety and they seem to always just suggest getting on SSRI’s. I have been prescribed “as needed” types of medication that I have barely tried because they only help temporarily and in the long term for me probably only did more damage than good. 
I have general anxiety and health anxiety but it seems to come and go. I’m fairly healthy (fairly good diet and I am very active) and I am not the most stressed person I just tend to have episodes of anxiety that I can’t find the reason for. It mostly effects my sleep and appetite(and nausea) which only negatively effects my health which just worsens my anxiety. It can be just short panic attacks that I’ve had my whole life which really blow but aren’t much of a concern since I’m used to it. What really sucks it just the periods that feel like I’m always at like a 5/10 to 9/10 anxiety that lasts for days that makes school, work, socializing, eating/sleeping especially ,and all the things that I usually don’t think twice about, turn into the most difficult tasks. 
I do feel that more often than not, when I am experiencing prolonged anxiety it is because I am not taking care of my body as much. It often may come about when I am trying to fit too much into my life and not allowing rest. This usually consists of working/school, exercising/hobbies, and staying out late while trying to get enough rest between. I can see an obvious reflection of health on anxiety. This makes me stray away from intense medication.
Although I feel less anxiety when I’m treating myself better(which is obvious for anyone), I still go through periods of almost unbearable anxiety even when I have been getting rest and staying healthy. While intense episodes seem inevitable, I want to prevent the long term ones that really disrupt my life. 
What I am getting at is I wonder if any one else has experienced what I am or has the same attitude towards immediate medication. 

Has anyone had any specific treatments or practices (aside from just general health and exercise) that really helped?

Are there specific things I can check for at the doctor such as hormone levels or something that I can work on balancing before going directly to serotonin in meds?

Idk if this sounds corny but people preach forms of “meditation”, does anyone have a positive experience with this? Or really understand what it does?

2022-11-13 13:57:04,Anxiety,"I know, Anxiety can do a lot of things to us. Both mentally as well as physically. But there's one flickering 'Feeling' that I get throughout each day, that I can't necessarily put my finger on. 

I have been diagnosed with (Depression, Anxiety, OCD, Tourrets, GERD, ADHD) - It could be a mixture of these things for all I know. But it's definitely a feeling (Emotion) vs something that is physical. 

I could be completely distracted and then suddenly, just get this fleeting feeling that I am going crazy or that I am off, before I revert back to being fine, which only makes me confused as to why I felt that way (Makes these episodes worse) Almost like a wire is loose, or some moment of dread. 

I do experience -Depersonalization/Environmental- periods (Often a lot) So it could be tied into that somewhere. But normally I can distinguish what I am anxious about (Mostly Health Related) but this is something that I can't seem to grasp or hold a general idea over. Like it's not even there, yet it is.

I could be laughing, feeling great and all the sudden there's that nagging 'Wire' touching again and I get thrown for a loop before BAM, I'm fine again.  Even when I try to just ignore it, the feeling comes back on a reccuring set-system. Sometimes it does make me feel like I'm not exactly 'Real' it can trigger it, but most of the time it's just that, a feeling. A very confusing feeling that is VERY annoying. A mood killer for sure.

i think the main reason is i cannot adapt to new places and people and things at all. our school has changed our classes last year and i was separated from all my close friends. then everthing started to go downhill. i think they might be bored of me. and when they dont see me as much as they used to, they forget about my existence. when they go out for breaks they wait for eachothet at their classroom doors but not for me. 

also new people joined our friend group because of this class change thing. and i dont like it too, i guess it makes me bad person because they didnt do anything bad. they are just friends but, i guess i cannot adapt to new things as well as the others around me. 

also i cannot express my feelings to outside very well. and i always try to be the mature one or the collected one. and this started to break me down faster. after years and years, i just cannot stand to this but im not like the people who can just come up and say ""im sad today can you hug me, i think you guys dont like me"". there is a friend of mine who is like this. this annoys me too cause i cannot do the same i thing. insted of blaming myself for being so anxious about talking, i just get mad over other people.

also, everyone has a best friend and i see this clearly. its normal. but i dont know if the one who i see as my bestfriend sees me as her bestfriend. i just cant let this thought go for over 2 or 3 years. i tend to overthink so much but i cant help it.",i feel like im not good enough

If I try to play video games, I slowly get more and more anxious, until I quit the game and go back to chatting. Unhappy thoughts and memories also start to creep in.

I think I already overloaded one of the people I shared numbers with from the psych ward. Now I'm trying to add more people I met in the psych ward to a discord server I made, so I have more people to talk to and I don't overdo it with all the messages.

It might be a really good thing that I am so drawn to other people now, but It's really weird that it happened so suddenly and so late in my life (36). I could imagine this happening in my early 20s when my bipolar really ramped up, but this is odd timing.

But on Zoloft you can't drink at all and I really like a good glass of bourbon.

This is something I've never experienced before after 10 years of bad anxiety. I'm so worried the headache was related and that something is wrong. I'm afraid to sleep as I think I will end up with a nocturnal panic attack or worse.

2022-11-13 09:14:06,Anxiety,"I have been taking medication for quite some time now for my anxiety. I also have panic attacks. I realized how lonely I am in life even though it’s not a bad one. I am tired of always putting myself in a box  and avoiding social environments. Because of my anxiety and taking medicines that slightly help it while giving me many negative effects I have decided no more. I don’t care what my doctor, family or anyone says.

2022-11-13 09:12:51,Anxiety,"When I was a kid, I had horrible anxiety. And I guess one of the problems that never left, was the fact that I was embarrassed about my breathing. How loud I was breathing, the pattern, how much I'd allow my lungs to expand etc. 

It sounds so silly, I know. But this was one of the things that I was anxious about. Tbh I didn't realise how bad I used to be, until now. 

Even today, I still feel embarrassed if I can hear my own breathing. Over the years, I taught myself to do it as quiet as possible. Quiet, slow, deep breaths. Actually... I think this has helped my anxiety. Of course it's not cured, but this definitely helps, especially in stressful moments.",Does anyone else hate the sound of their own breathing?
2022-11-13 09:11:19,Anxiety,"This might be a long one. For the first I’d say 26-27 years of my life I’d say I was extremely care free and did whatever I wanted. That included eating whatever I wanted (fast food) all the time, drinking whatever I wanted (alcohol and energy drinks) all the time, and smoking (weed and cigarettes) daily.

Around the time I was 27 I was doing all the above mentioned things while working as an overnight caregiver. I tell you this because I got no exercise at this job. It was an overnight position I pretty much did the same things at work I did at home.

I got up to 250 pounds in weight and experienced what I thought was a heart attack, several doctors assured me it was almost positively anxiety because people that young don’t usually have heart attacks unless there is another specific problem.

This caused me to get my life together. I started watching what I ate, I started going on walks, I don’t drink or smoke anymore, except for the occasional beer at dinner for example.

I’m 31 now almost 32 and thing have been pretty good. I have a job doing shipping and receiving so I get to exercise every day. The problem is though that I’ve slowly started embracing some vices because of how well I am doing.

Over the last couple weeks I’ve felt like the anxiety is starting to creep back into my life. Last weekend my wife and I were traveling and out of nowhere I started feeling anxiety. To the point I had to pull over.

I asked her to drive and she did. While she was driving I was leaned back in the passenger seat with my eyes closed trying to breathe and calm down. My hands got numb and tingly and I thought I was going to pass out.

We were traveling to a restaurant in the literal middle of nowhere (40 miles to nearest town) because she was on vacation and wanted to check this place out. Idk if it was a feeling of isolation or if it was low blood sugar. I say that because I started feeling better almost immediately after starting to eat.

Fast forward to us being home and playing Xbox and out of nowhere I’ll just feel uncomfortable like I’m gonna pass out and I have to start pacing or lay in my bed to calm down. I hate this feeling.

I went on a walk today to try and ease my mind. And it worked. I think I may need to start going on daily 30-45 minute walks. Because for me that truly does seem to the cure all. I just hate that I get this way.

My doctor had me on Sertraline for a bit but I really hate pharmaceuticals. I don’t want to have to rely on pills to be normal. I just wanted to share a little of my story and vent. I wouldn’t wish anxiety on anyone. It can truly be debilitating and feels like life and almost every time.",Just a little about me and my anxiety.

Hi, I'm not sure if this is the right place to come, but... I thought I'd try.

I've been having pretty bad intrusive thoughts and I've been doing som research about it. Something very common people say about intrusive thoughts is that they are usually the opposite of how you actually feel. I understand why people say that, you know, cause it's true, but it has scared me a little bit and i just need som reassurance or something.

For two years, I’ve only been able to get (most) relief from my mom. I think I’ve had separation anxiety since I was a baby (because of abandonment issues from my dad?— I’ve been extremely close with my mom for my entire life). I lived in NY my whole life, I couldn’t not leave home like this for college. Even with my ex-long term boyfriend and my closest friends with family, Ive had severe panic. I cannot drive anymore.

2022-11-13 08:36:55,Anxiety,"I was seeing this guy a few months ago. We started dating, it went well, y'know, we did fun easy things together.

And then he got sick, I got sick, it all went downhill. I feel like I developed a lot of anxiety around the relationship around this time because it ended up being we didn't see each other for a month (isolation periods) and then we went like 3 weeks in between dates. I kept seeing myself as he was seeing me, this tense nervy creature who couldn't react to a joke or whatever. It was intended to be serious from the start, but by the time we agreed to take a pause he was so busy he was barely thinking about making dates with me. He's often said he's busy - gym, work full-time, running his house, home chores, all that. So am I though, study full-time, work, gym, still gotta do assignments and home chores, etc. 

And we don't have much in common. This was a big concern for him. My personality - I know it's not great. I struggle to relate to things. Apparently I tend to be a bit non-responsive unless it's things I'm super into or things I can relate to. I know I can be a bit blank and underwhelming, if you tell me a joke or a funny story I probably won't laugh and respond like you'd expect. I don't have a huge number of interests, and the ones that I do have are solitary pursuits. Some people are interested in music and put their favourite band posters on the wall. I keep them in my headphones. I like creative writing, which isn't always easy to share.

Anyway, when we settled on the break I asked for two months to get my uni semester done, get used to what were fairly big changes in my life, try to put the anxiety past me. It's kinda working. I'm on sertraline, it eases a lot of the mental strain. Except now it's been that two months. I don't think the online therapy I'm accessing is very helpful. He's said he's willing to wait. I'm terrified to reach out tho because, well, I'm still anxious. I know i vented a lot of anxieties to him. I want him back, but I don't want to be his second thought. I don't want to always be the one pushing for a date, and I'm scared that as soon as he hits busy periods he'll shunt me to the side to deal. I'm scared that I won't be reactive in the way he wants. I know i'm not good at communication. We won't magically have more in common now than we did two months ago. 

Ugh. I just don't know what to do. My best friend has said they will support me whatever I do, they just want me to be happy.

2022-11-13 08:35:45,Anxiety,"tl;dr I was unexpectedly fired once and keep thinking it'll happen again in a job I really like

This basically started back in March 2020 at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Context. I'd been working as a Software Engineer for a telecommunications company since I graduated in 2018. Not long after we got the order to work from home, my line manager called me up to say there terminating my contract. Not furloughing me, just firing me on the spot. I had no idea it was coming. I'd been working there under 2 years though so there was nothing I could do.

Fast forward to March 2022, and I've started my current job. I like it very much at my new company. My team and my manager are all very nice and very helpful. But I can't enjoy it, because my previous experience with being fired out of nowhere and wanting to hold onto this job for dear life is messing me up.

If I make a mistake, my immediate reaction is to think ""oh no, this is going to count against me and they can use this to build a case to fire me"". If I get stuck with something and have to ask for help from somebody in my team, it's always ""you're not skilled enough for this, any idiot with a Computer Science degree would know what they're doing"".

My head is just full of negative thought patterns, and I've never been able to give myself enough credit for anything, not even graduating in the first place. That actually feels like a fluke. I'm scared every day I do the job I love and need is my last",I have an irrational fear of losing my job

I think these reactions are from how I used to be treated at my previous grammar and high schools. They didn't understand my anxiety, attention and family issues, and cynicism toward the curriculum. 

I wasn't really a bad student I just had a hard time with doing work unless I knew why I was straining my attention and poor eyesight, and I didn't like their answers. I participated in class only when it seemed the material was going somewhere and skipped a lot of scantrons.

For this I was treated like I was trouble. They just watched me fall behind further between age 9 and 16, and I got stigmatized with various labels like ""demoted,"" ""dropping down a class,"" ""taking classes with the dumb students.""  

The fight between me and the school administrations over my grades eventually turned into simple neglect. ""You chose to be a loser, and we're gonna focus our time on making science fair winners graduate."" 

So I have a lot of resentment toward our meritocratic society now, but nobody ever says ""I can see why this is hard for you.""  They just tell me to be a go-getter, and I don't work on that frequency.

I didn’t like the anxiety I was getting when I’d have a energy drink and some dip or a cig so I quit cold turkey. I was also drinking everyday, at least two beers. I used caffine and nicotine multiple times a day since around 2015. 

I went cold turkey maybe 2-3 weeks ago, and one day I was doing dishes and I noticed a tightness in my throat, felt like a lump. Then a tightness in my chest ( not a sharp pain, but it felt like it was heavy. It was tight) increased heart rate (55-65 resting to around 100BPM) and shortness of breath. Iver the course of days it got so bad to where I was at work and felt like I was going to pass out from these exact symptoms. 

I thought there was something wrong with me so I went to the ER, got blood, urine, x rays of my chest, MRIs with due to look for clots, EKGs, took aspirin, I truthfully thought there was something wrong with my heart. 

I got the runaround at the hospital, so after my first hospital visit about 2 weeks (at this point im around 3 weeks sober from all substances) I had the worst one yet. Heart rate from 55-65 peaked at 146bpm, chest tightness, shortness of breath, disorientation, clammy hands, tingles in hands and feet and the ER caught it as it was happening. 

I was told it was panic attacks due to going cold turkey from these substances, at this moment I don’t know when they happen. Through the day im usually pretty chest tight and short of breath, especially when I stand up or am moving around.

I'm having some increased mental problems right now. I'm undiagnosed but I'm very sure that I have OCD or anxiety (I think you will agree when reading further). So it all started on my friends birthday party. I got drunk, like really drunk. I dont think that I was ever that drunk before. It wasnt a complete black out since I can remember most things, even going peeing etc. I dont remember what happened in every single moment of the evening, but I think I would also not sober (right?). Anyways, I always went out to pee on the grass with my friend (garden party next to a forest, no toilet). Along the evening I started to worry about if something sexual happened that I couldnt remember because of being drunk (while e.g. having my pants down from peeing). Like I said, I do remember most of the times I was peeing, I remember that when I was at my most drunk stage of the night I fell down while peeing (I know I know havent drank since then). Is that an indicator that I was not too blacked out to remember potential intercourse? I asked my friends about it, but they said nothing happened, and that my friend always joined me when peeing so he would've noticed someone taking advantage. Anyways, I even checked myself and my panties on that evening - no traces. Now, 4 months later, I still worry about the exact same thing. I have even taking one pregnancy test that was negative, but I'm at the point where I'm seriously doubting if I even used it right - should I have taken a second one? I dont really have symptoms as far as I can tell, but I have PCOS so many symptoms overlap and I have a quite large belly due to my PCOS which grew a bit, but I also gained weight. Its more like a belly flap on the bottom. I also have my withdrawal bleed on the pill - but its not very strong. If I didnt have sex that night I'm still a virgin (I'm taking the pill for PCOS).

I handled the transactions fine, fixing part of my order, 2 people complimented the shirt I was wearing on the way in and out. It was a positive experience. That, as stupid as it may sound to someone from the outside.. meant alot to me. I was just really proud of myself &amp; I know she would be too. I'm taking the steps to better myself, towards the person I want to be &amp; working on my social anxiety, cause I don't want it to define me or hold me back. 

It felt really good but hurt when I remembered I couldn't tell her &amp; have her say something cute to motivate me. Even without her, the reward is knowing that I did something that made myself proud today. Step one of building up self confidence.","i can't tell her, so i'll tell you!"

I really didn't know what made me write this post today but I'm so just exhausted and really hopeless and just need some advices!! :-( N.B: I'm sorry about my English, it's my second language.

LIKE CAN I JUST EXIST? I just feel that I'm hated by everyone and I'm not lovable at all, I got criticized by everyone like LITERALLY EVERYONE, whenever I go out I hear someone say something rude about me, at the uni always, my neighbors, EVEN ONE OF MY TEACHER TOLD ME SHE DON'T LIKE ME AND HOW SHE DON'T LIKE GIRLS THAT AREN'T CONFIDENT BECAUSE I WAS SO STRESSED THAT I FORGOT ALL MY SPEECH OF TODAY'S PRESENTATION AND WHEN I GET UP TO TAKE MY LAST WEEK assignment that had to be marked SHE TOLD ME THIS PAPER IS JUST TRASH LIKE I JUST CAME HOME AND CRIED ALL DAY. LIKE WHY DO YOU HAVE TO BE RUDE?, I don't know what's wrong with me and I always have this problem with other people, always been criticized.. I'm just convinced by now that the problem is surely from me. I always try to be kind, like always and it just make me more of a victim. When I talk for example with my family and close friends if something is off with my appearance they always say that I'm so pretty etc.. I always been called a zombie, an alien LIKE I MEAAAAN ALWAYS AND I JUST FEEL LIKE THAT NOW I JUST LOST ALL MY CONFIDENCE.

2022-11-13 06:36:17,Anxiety,"Hi y’all! I have been on Zoloft since a really bad mental health break last June (2021). it helped me stabilize and function again from a bad episode of panic disorder and OCD. I had a really hard time getting on it. Super foggy and anxiety increased, insomnia, you name it.

Now a year and a half later, I’ve moved 1,000 miles from home, fell in love and have two dogs. It helped me gain the ambition to do all these things. 

But I feel so detached and in my head. I still get raving thoughts that come and go, but no physical manifestations of anxiety. Just feeling really foggy, apathetic and just numb. Idk how to describe it - like lack of knowing myself??? 

I’m on 100mg, and I’m scared to go up or down based on my fear of my panic attacks coming back. And I’m scared to switch meds because I feel like I’m reliant on them, and don’t wanna experience the side effects of a new medicine. I’m talking to a psychologist Monday, I just wanna know if anyone else had experienced this before.

2022-11-13 06:24:53,Anxiety,"Hey all, 

I've never posted on here before but I'm currently at an all-time low and unsure what to do. I  just got back from the emergency and was told yet again this is Mental Health related. This post may be a bit long but I want to include everything I'm experiencing and how it happened. 

I'm Male currently 30 years old.

I've always been a super outgoing guy, always preached low stress about most situations. Always wanting to go out and be among people, love to travel super active workout 6 times a week. 

My career and love has always been Fire Fighting I started at 19 years old volunteering with my local town. At 21 years old I joined the military as a firefighter served 3 and half years and got out and made the transition into the civilian sector of firefighting. 

In 2019 (prior to Covid) I was working on shift at the station and all of a sudden after a run I got really flush and lightheaded. Booked an appointment with GP checked my BP everything was fine, told him hypertension and heart issues run in my family so he referred me to a Cardiologist. Things started to get worse I developed more and more symptoms. (Head Pressure, twitching, loose bowel, stomach pain, Shortness of breath) went back to GP and said he thinks this may be mental health related. I didn't want to believe that it was just that because these physical symptoms were so common and happened very frequently. 

Another month passed and the symptoms got worse and more started to show up. I think I had a list of about 25 symptoms I wrote down but the ones that were most prevalent were (SOB, twitching, head pressure brain bog loose bowels, and general weakness and fatigue) These symptoms got so bad that they affected my ability to do my job and I could no longer work.  Started seeing a Psychologist which helped but really didn't do anything for the physical symptoms. 

I Saw GP and over about a year had lots of tests done full Cardiologist workup (EKG, ECG, Echocardiogram, and stress test) Lung X-Ray, Spirometry Test, and lots and lots of blood work, CT Scan of my head all came up normal. Started seeing a Psychiatrist, and ended up being diagnosed with General Anxiety, PTSD, Depression, and Physcosymtomatic Disorder. Lost my dream job as a firefighter and was off work for almost 2 years.I was prescribed an anti-depressant. Made me super sick had to come off that and was put on 150mg of Sertraline and 2mg of Aripiprazole. I was on this medication and 2 years and gained over 100 pounds. I went from a super active person to a literal blob I stopped enjoying everything I use to do hate crowds, hate going out just no joy out of anything.  While on this medication It helped slightly? still had the psychical symptoms. Recently came off all medication in September and felt better but again physical symptoms are still there some days worse than others. The only medication I find that actually helps is Ativan (I do not abuse it and only take it in emergency situations) started to develop an eye twitch in the last couple weeks had facial numbness in the left side today so went to the emergency as advised by telenurse again doctor thinks it is anxiety related. 

I just want to feel normal, I could deal with the mental symptoms but the physical symptoms just ruin me. I don't know what to do anymore am I like this forever? Will it ever get better? I know I lucky to still be alive and kicking but some days I just don't know what to do. If you are still here, thanks for listening.",Please tell me there is someone out there going through something similar

2022-11-13 06:16:20,Anxiety,"I (m30) have been in a relationship with my partner (f28) for almost 5 years now, of which a little more than 2 years we have been living together.

I do not know what exactly she is discussing with her therapist (now into 4-5 sessions or so) but I am positive from all research I can possibly do and within the limitations of reasonable doubt that she does have GAD or a closely related disease. The description on Wikipedia reads like a snap version of her bio. She is afraid about literally everything that has in any way to do with relationships, perceptions of her by other people and health. What has turned out to be even more dreadful than hell and devil to her though is **explaining herself**, or as she tends to put it, **""justifying"" herself**, which she equates with answering questions or expressing opinions that would require her to expose feelings and thoughts (even in moments where me or whichever collocutor have zero emotional stake in it). She admits this from time to time, saying that she always feels like she's doing it all wrong (meaning the art of life basically), that she cannot take any decision (e.g. she gives me negligible text messages and e-mails to proofread) and that she thinks of herself to be dumbest fck roaming the streets. Her anxiety has already materialized into serious physical issues through teeth grinding etc, like chronic neck and jaw pain. 

What I want to add at this point for all fairness is that I have my own issues arising from childhood emotional neglect and growing up in a cult-aligned family for the first 18 years of my life. 

Most of our conflicts are almost mundane: sex-life downs, different ideas about hygiene or tidiness, finding a shared hobby for ourselves or discussing her daily issues at work or with friends. From my perspective, it gets difficult when I feel like being able to help her only if she trusted me and openly shared her thoughts and feelings so that I can relate to and empathise. Unfortunately, this seems to be the major hurdle. She bombards me mostly with illogical deflections and meaningless references to outside explanations for everything that is not going well. Often, I feel forced to question and dig and dig until in 1 out of 50 cases maybe she gives me the straightforward answer that makes her look honest and vulnerable and clearly explains her actions or words and could have made the whole discussion redundant. But obviously this is impossibly sustainable and takes a big toll on her and me. That she is not able to confide in me (or at least **someone** else) to that level and defines hapiness in her life as the extent of reality-denying distractions during every minute off work is, I admit, triggering me hard on my background.

How can I help my anxious gf to deal with her issues, to find the confidence for herself to tell me (or others) how she thinks and feels and establish somewhat of a trusted dialogue where we can both speak openly and do not have to go through attritional proxy battles until we can have - maybe and at most - 5 minutes of real talk. How can I convince her that revealing herself to me is part of the solution and not the problem, while avoiding triggering her endless fears?",How can I go through and resolve relationship conflicts with my anxious gf?

2022-11-12 16:55:44,Anxiety,"TL;DR: parents told me (21,22f Indian muslim) that they’re going to marry me off in a year and my mental health has lost it.

Today my mother(48?) told me that I (an Indian Muslim living in India) need to loose weight and my dad will “marry me off” in a year. A little background info here is that I’m quite fat, in class 2 obese category. My parents keep taunting to get me to loose weight ever since I was a kid. Im aware of my weight and the problems with it and am currently struggling to lose it.today My mom said I need to lose weight quickly so they can get me married.

She said that since I’m not pursuing any “esteemed” college course, they don’t have to wait any longer. Im currently still a 12th grade graduate. I haven’t attended college yet. My education has been very troubled for the past 3 years. And just this year I got around enrolling myself in an online college in the Bachelor of Business Administration program.

So when my mother told me this, I didn’t show her any emotions because she doesn’t support my feelings and she’ll only say some more mean stuff if she sees I’m being weak.I maintained a poker face as well as I could and ended the convo with “yes I’ll do that” . I tried to tel her “I don’t want to get married” and she kept on saying that it’s their religious duty by god to marry me off (I’m a Muslim). Hence I said ok and left.

Ever since I left that room, my brain and body are in a turbulence. I can literally feel my hands shaking and my head feels so heavy and I can’t stop crying and worrying. I don’t want to go through this. I Can’t let them throw me into this. They’ve done something similar when I was 9 and now again. 

Please tell me how to think through this rationally. I want to calm myself, get through the year working hard and find a way to make money online. So that I can move out as soon as freaking possible. But I need to think and talk straight. Which I can’t. All my childhood painful memories and nightmares are just flashing before me. And I don’t want to cry in front of my parents because they say even more mean stuff and aren’t understanding at all. I don’t want them to suppress me even more after seeing how weak I am.

I don’t want to get married, I’ve always wanted to live single. And only get married after 27. But this is happening so soon. But I don’t even have any money to just run away from home and rent an apartment even. I’m not independent yet. I didn’t know they’ll force me to marry so soon even before I could generate some form of income.

I tried keeping this as short as possible so incase u need any other info pls just comment.",How do I stop myself from this sudden increased anxiety due to which I can’t sleep or think?

sedative disorder:
opiate disorder

which are false except the opiate. i can drink fine and do it occasionallyi don’t care to smoke weed and during my anxious flare ups i tried to get diazEpam for my TMJ spell and insomni ruining my life and i decided to self medicate with oxycodone during that time which led to more issues because my new gp said “uR an addIct so no”

fucking hell.  i would go to my old gp but i heard that once you’re flagged you’re fucked which makes me
hopeless.  i tried zoloft baclofen and lexapro.  i don’t wanna go on daily drugs and preferred my old scripts where i had maybe 10-15 pills ina. month - 2 month period to help me out during these attacks:

hot flashes 
jaw pain 
headache
stress 
rumination
insomnia

fuck rehabs and AA programs i went there a couple years ago and i still deal w consequences.  turns out i actually have an anxiety disorder not to what the dumb nurse who i just met in there saying the drugs caused it (got diangnozed too before i got involved w opiates) and contrary im not one of those addicts that trade one for another or abuse every med ONLY DID OXYCODONE

i can’t do antidepressants unless one w0 side effects ere ipossible and alleviate the annoying symptoms like hot flashes and insomnia without making me a brain dead zombie during the day  

just venting.  i already do eat a healthy diet and have been lifting consistently. my alc usage is limited to 1-3 beers max usually w family on days off and kava.
literally today was good moods goes from that literally to irritated as shit cause of the generalized anxiety attack i’m having rn and then remembering how resentful i am at rehab from
banning me from meds i never got addicted to because “one is never enough “ bullshit!!!  ofc i get opiates but FUCK i’m not making up these symtpoms you criminal money making liars",feeling hopeless

2022-11-12 12:03:16,Anxiety,"I posted this on the ADHD forum, also, but as someone who deals with anxiety/OCD too, I thought I'd post this over here Incase y'all would get a kick out of it.

Why hello folks, so I figured I'd tell y'all about the time in elementary school I got expelled because they thought I was possessed. Let's begin.

So I had severe ADHD and OCD as a kid, and was in the process of getting trialed on various stimulant medications in order to help me in school and at home. I forgot the exact medication, but basically my psychiatrist wasn't really that good of a physician. He decided after trialing one medication that didn't fit me, to switch me over to another medication with no titration or anything. And on that same fateful day, my parents accidentally gave me some cough medicine without knowing it interacted with the meds.

I grew up in the Midwest, and went to a Catholic elementary school. This school was run by nuns. The principal was a nun, so was the vice principal, and they were old mentality. I got to school that day and was in one of my classes when BAM, I blacked right the hell out. Next thing I know, I had woken up in the nurse's office writhing around saying it felt like bugs were under my skin. I didn't realize at the time that this was my first panic attack brought on by the norepinephrine increase from the medication, in addition to the interaction from the cough medicine. 

I remember being told to just wait in the nurse's office and that the school would call my parents to pick me up. Well they did call my parents, and decided to have a private meeting with them right then and there. 

Basically what happened in that meeting was that the principal said that they believed I was possessed by the devil. My parents explained to them that it was a medication mishap and that there were absolutely no demons involved in this situation. But alas, the principal was not receptive. They told my parents ""there's nothing we can do here to help him"" and expelled me. 

My parents didn't tell me what actually had happened until years later, and in the time being just played it off like they didn't like me being at the school at the time and wanted to transfer me. So I transferred to a public school where I ended up getting my accommodations met, and met my best friend who I am just as close with to this day.

When my parents told me what had actually happened, I think they expected me to be really hurt and upset by the school. Nope. I was laughing my ass off. It's a serious shame that the school handled things the way they did, but also it felt kinda iconic on my part and makes for a great story, now. 

So the moral of the story here is to choose your schools wisely for your kids, choose your psychiatrist wisely, and check for medication interactions before mixing things. 

Have a good one, people!","STORYTIME: The time a medication interaction led to me getting expelled, and my school thinking I was possessed by the devil."

I applied to jobs before I quit but I faced issues with trying to get time off for interviews. It was a really toxic environment and id wake up with ny heart racing about the thought of work that day. I thought with my experience and l making looking for work my full time jobs I'd be able to find something fairly quickly. I immediately had to deal with a family tragedy (my grandmother started dying and it was a slow and painful 10 days to witness). I took a couple weeks to recoup and apply. I reached out to my references and spoke to old coworkers. I've been applying to jobs and had a handful of interviews. But now it's 8 months down and I'm close to not being able to pay my rent. The jobs near me don't pay enough for my expenses and my mental health has taken a huge dive. I keep being told that managers can't find people but that's just not true. I straight up don't know how to unfuck my life. I'm 28 and am going to have to crawl back to my parents :(,"Close to not being able to pay my rent, work around me have dried up and the cost of living is brutal. I'm at the end of my rope."

2022-11-12 11:28:56,Anxiety,"For a few years I took a lot of different drugs due to social anxiety and a tad of insecurity. It was mostly cocaine, weed and alcohol. Sometimes mdma but not too often. I never took anything else and it wasn’t ever daily. I was a functioning addict - only taking it on weekends. 

I had a huge panic attack in March 2021 after a bad edible experience followed by taking mdma a week after and having a panic attack on the comedown. Since then I have not touched a drop of alcohol or ANYTHING. 

My anxiety resolves around my old clothing, money, surfaces, my boyfriend. I’m constantly checking for weed everywhere and I can’t eat food or smoke (just nicotine) without thinking I’ve ingested some sort of drug. This, on top of my fear of going insane is effecting me greatly. I need some reassurance and some advice. Sometimes I fear a fast food worker has spiked my McDonald’s with drugs (I know right?) or a spec of cocaine from my past has gotten into my system. Sometimes I even fear I’ve ingested psychedelics (I’ve never even taken them!)  

My boyfriend does smoke weed but he’s removed everything away from me and keeps his stuff strictly downstairs in a room.

I just have this intense fear I’ve ingested it all the time. I know it’s my anxiety but I’m petrified of feeling like I did on that edible. I don’t want to be alone inside my mind like that again.",Anxiety after being an addict

2022-11-12 11:18:01,Anxiety,"So today I had to go into an office to pick up supplies for my new job I’m starting which is WFH.

I then tried pulling the door… it wasn’t locked. I walked in and the three people behind the reception stared without saying anything. I felt embarrassed but it quickly passed and I moved on. I didn’t lose my cool. I believed in myself. 

The rest of the visit was pleasant! I feel like I came off as professional, albeit a bit silly (which is accurate). Most importantly, I was confident and don’t take myself too seriously.

However, more often than not, I start getting anxiety sometimes out of nowhere and sometimes there's a reason.

And then I get anxiety cuz of my anxiety and sweating. 

I'm calling it anxiety but I'm not 100% sure if my sweating is caused by that or one of my medications. I take Buspar for anxiety, Bupropion for depression, and Venlafaxine for both depression and anxiety. So I'm not sure if one of my medications is making me sweat whenever I'm out or it's my anxiety and nervousness being around people.

2022-11-12 09:54:46,Anxiety,"Ive dealt with severe anxiety my entire life. Ive avoided everything in life and just focused on getting my degree. I was also financially struggling during uni and my family as well while growing up.

Ive been on this Earth for 25 years and have no real or memorable experiences that I can look back at. Everything I get nostalgic about is from my time as a kid goofing around with my siblings when my anxiety did not affect me as badly.

I have been working for a while and lately Ive been forcing myself to go out whenever I get invited from coworkers and it finally hit me. Once I get into any event that I’m stressing to death over, it is not as bad.

People are not those scary individuals that will bully you for any imperfections you have. I do still overthink anytime I come back home but im working on that. 

Im just sad that it took me this long to figure it out. Im so far behind (never really experienced love or have a great social understanding ) and I hate that this is bringing me down even though i wanna be hopeful about the future. Its time I have lost and can not get back. I know it’s useless to regret it because you can’t change your past and its best to look forward. 

It still sucks. I try not to think about it but these thoughts always find a way. I will never again have time during school to just enjoy myself. Work allows you to do that for sure but to me it just seems a lot more rigid due to the different responsibilities I now have as I get through my 20s.

Again physically I would never do anything. I'm just scared that if I accidentally mentally think about it somehow it will actually hurt my eye and I'm just trying to wonder if that is at all a thing it's really kind of an OCD thing because it triggers badly sometimes and sometimes it just goes away I don't know it sounds crazy but I keep thinking we're mentally much more stronger than we think.

He told me he didn’t see anything long term with her, barely knew her, and even said “Fuck no” when I asked him if he was upset when she ghosted him. 


The thing is, before this conversation happened, I had asked him what happened with her (because I didn’t know she ghosted him) I asked if he ended things w her, if she ended things w him, if it was mutual, etc.  But his response was “she FUCKING ghosted me” and with a response like that, I’m starting to get paranoid that he is hurt by it and cares a lot because of the way he answered me.

2022-11-12 09:15:36,Anxiety,"I will try to be brief with my issue(s).

Male, Caucasian, 25 years old, Obese, Smoker (heated tobbaco). No medications, no somatic illness diagnosed. Working with therapist on resolving psychosomatic issues and anxiety.

I have been having issues with anxiety, health anxiety and  panic disorder since November 2021 after a huge mental stress from getting the COVID Vaccine (was bombarded with information about clots, pericarditis etc. in young adults) and with combination of anaerobic exercise before bed, bad routine and work stress.

From that point I have been having some weird symptoms. I will rank them from the most recent to the most lasting and also, what I have convinced myself I have.

1. Temple twitching

For the past week, temple twitches have been my nightmare. They come out of nowhere. Only on my right side, and last only for a couple of seconds. There are days where they are not occuring. Feels like sudden twitches/pulsing in my temple. No pain, no headache. I got myself conviced it is temporal arteritis, aneurysm, blood clot or at first, stroke.

2. Weird pressure in my right part of an abdomen

This also occured only last week, but I have already had this feeling few years ago (resolved on its own). It feels like there are rocks in my stomach. Feels like a pressure in there with little to no pain. No diarrhea/constipation, no blood in the stool, no need to pee more, no fever.
I have convinced myself its apendicitis or colon cancer.

3. Good old air hunger

Since this only appears when my anxiety is high, or when I focus on it. I truly think its an anxiety. Its a feeling of not getting enough air in, so I am constantly trying to get a deep breath or a yawn to satisfy my brain. No pain, no issues while exerting myself. I understand that its hyperventilation and I am trying to manage it better. Also, I have convinced myself its either astma, blood clots in my lungs or a heart issue.

4. Jolting from sleep suddenly after drifting to sleep

This is one of the worst feelings. As I am falling asleep I get jolted from that state with a feeling I need to take a deep breath. Its awful. It is only occuring when I am under high stress, anxiety or when I push myself to sleep. When I am relaxed or I do not think about it, it does not happen. I have also convinced myself this is a terminal respiratory or heart issue.

Could you please somehow reassure me that I am delusional and that this all can be a symptom of GAD? My practicioner thinks it's all anxiety, and is supportive, but I just need a second opinion.

I feel like every day I wake up I'm haunted by this sense of anxiety and worry that never goes away. When I reach into my pantry barehanded I'm struck by fears of being bitten by a black or brown widow, so I've begun to wear rubber gloves or oven mitts when getting food. When I eat meat I'm terrified of consuming anything undercooked, so I've started cutting every piece of turkey, chicken, or beef into tiny pieces to check for redness and sometimes vomit up my food if I have doubts. Today I accidentally poked the end of my finger with a syringe I use for my cats' insulin and panicked to the point of hyperventilating until I found a post online that said it wasn't dangerous, yet still I can't get the thought out of my head and keep checking my finger for swelling or discoloration. I live in total terror. I have trouble sleeping at night because I'm so scared of everything. Every weird ache is cancer, and every scratch in my throat is an anaphylactic allergic reaction. I can't stand this. I hate living this way. I'm twenty years old and I don't know how I'm ever going to move out of my parent's house at this rate. My fear is so bad I can't properly take care of myself.

Then later on in the day I start feeling the same way again. I’m drinking enough water too (I’m very conscious about water intake as I deal with a lot of UTIs). Is this normal? I feel like I’m going crazy as all I can do is just shove my face with food.,Increase in Pristiq dose and I’m having an increase in hunger that is concerning me
2022-11-12 08:37:55,Anxiety,"I’m a 20 year old third year dental student and I have recently been thinking a lot about taking a gap year from college.

Ever since freshman year of high school, I’ve been studying hard day and night until I got accepted into the uni I’m in now. That’s great and all,but since the second semester of the first year my grades have been dropping slowly, and the the second year of uni my mental health took a toll and became even worse which led to my grades being even worse than my first year. I have tried many medications, been to different therapists, have my family’s support through all this, but nothing has gotten better. It’s getting worse everyday and my grades are getting affected. It has become debilitating, and that’s an understatement.

I also recently got diagnosed with bpd. I started taking mood stabilizers but they haven’t started working yet since this is my second week. I feel like my mind is always a mess and I can’t for the life of me focus on a single task. I thought about taking gap year for quite some time to focus on my mental health and to relax,but I don’t know if it’s the right choice for me since I have to be doing something for the rest of the year and not stay home doing absolutely nothing because that would make my mental health even worse. So what should I do?

(Btw in my country we can take a gap year at any point during the semesters at any year if it’s confusing)",Should I take a gap year from college?
2022-11-12 08:35:44,Anxiety,"I am around 4 inches and im indeed small girth wise as well. I am still a virgin and never had the confidence to show my dick to any girl unfortunately. I blame porn for this, as I never cared during 15-16 but as an adult im embarassed and depressed about reality. It only gets worse now. I am a white male and some of the porn that pops up on pornhub is “BBC white girl” “BBC cuckhold” etc. After seeing it, it boiled my blood. Why would any women do this? Degrade herself for money and the black guy seemed to like take revenge for the past? idk but the cuckhold stuff boiled my blood even more. Showing a white guy watching and the guy was average sized as well. It pisses me off seeing this and when I see black people with white women irl i cringe and get very furious in my mind. Why would any girl do this especially to their own race? emasculate a white person and be ok with it while getting plowed by the black guy who is seen like some animal. I dont know what to say but I am openly admitting I am not only insecure from porn but now I am racist.",porn has made me anxious and racist
2022-11-12 08:25:51,Anxiety,"Has anyone ever had vision problems induced by anxiety? 

I scheduled a vision exam that’s 10 days away and I’m curious to see if there’s really anything wrong. All of a sudden beginning 3 days ago I keep seeing these black spots- ‘floaters’ I guess is the correct term. And I feel extra bothered by the brightness of just day time, and lights in the stores and everything just looks blurry at times. I’ve never had vision issues other than being told I was farsighted a few years back. Got prescribed glasses but never felt the need to wear them because I can see what I need to just fine. Diagnosed with generalized anxiety, no other health issues. I monitor my blood pressure, blood sugar, heart rate and oxygen daily just as a precaution. Everything has been Normal and within range.

2022-11-12 08:14:50,Anxiety,"Is this anxiety? IF NOT can you give me some examples..

Some things I've had happen to me I'm not sure if I'm experiencing anxiety or it's something else/normal .

Examples;

Putting gas in my car and having a leakage I feel like everyone around me just saw I made a mess on accident and I'm utterly embarrassed. I go into my car sit there acting like I'm cleaning the inside of my car or doing something important really I'm wasting time until the fuel dries up in my head enough so I don't explode when I start the car. Also was a time similar to this I couldn't open my lid and I started feeling really embarrassed and sat in my car for a good while because I believed everyone saw me attempt to open my gas lid and couldn't. I waited for a long time just mind racing of telling myself just go try it again, no everyone saw you, I'm so embarrassed I'm gonna go out and it's not gonna open again etc.. I remember that day I left without putting gas that I paid for all because my heads telling me I should be embarrassed just to take off.



If I'm cooking and someone walks into the kitchen I go DUMB I start opening the fridge for no reason, acting like I'm looking for ingredients grabbing utensils I don't even know what they are I just can't cook or concentrate when someone's near me while cooking.



I can't work on my car Infront of my house, I have to drive it all the way to a discreet park just to put oil/fluids in it because I think everyone on my street is looking at me judging how I fix my car. Also my street is really quiet I think I'm dragging a lot of attention by just going outside, opening my rail gate. I also can't start my car when someone is nearby because I'm afraid it won't start and I'll be super embarrassed or that it sounds weird when it starts and they'll make fun of how something is wrong with my engine.


I haven't been through a carwash, I feel like I'll mess up and pop all my tires. 
I haven't been to any job interviews because the last time I went to one the manager got upset I was wearing a t-shirt and it put me down in shame. I'm constantly believing I'll be belittled or joked upon by more professional looking people.
I can't stop thinking ahead of time about things like I think so far ahead of time, I get depressed about dying too soon dying too late. I start thinking about why are we here, everybody's purpose is different because he don't all get the same amount of time to live. How were even made and how is it everybody looks different with how many people are in this world. I start thinking about how much time I've wasted with my life.  I start thinking of 10,20,30, years from now with all negative outcomes. 

If I missed a freeway exit it'll be because I wasn't in the right lane ahead of time and I feel like I'm either cutting Infront of someone switching lanes or something like that, I'll instantly also feel like everyone knows I missed my exit, so that makes me miss the next couple of exits to make it seem like I know what I'm doing...yeah wasting fu*c*n gas



Also, if I'm ever in a bad situation you can't talk to me I'll be so irritable. It's almost like I gotta sit down and concentrate and even talk to myself at times I have to I can't go on with my day without trying to concentrate if something is going on.

2022-11-12 07:45:27,Anxiety,"This is going to weird and irrational, but hear me out.

I have this irrational fear of me marrying some woman and her up coming out as a lesbian years later (I'm a male). If you've ever watched Friends the same thing happened to Ross with his ex-wife Carol. I worry because then that would mean I wasted years of my life with someone biologically incapable of loving me. After the divorce I would be too old to find love again. In order to ""cope"" I used to try to imagine that I could ""spot out"" if a girl was a lesbian and then wouldn't be attracted to her.

Well when I hit on this girl in college she told me she was a lesbian and had a girlfriend. I felt really awful about it. It felt like I had one foot in the pond. I feared for months about falling for a lesbian and I kinda failed. I never dated her of course but if she would have been insecure about her sexuality and tried to date me then I my fear would have happened for real. I felt like I personally failed because I failed with the one thing I obsessed over for months. Now I realize that I will never be able to ""tell"" if a girl is lesbian and that I could end up accidentally marrying one.

I know this fear is irrational and that it's very rare to happen, but not impossible. How do I stop being so paranoid about this? I feel like this fear has subconsciously deterred me from dating. I haven't asked out another girl since.",How do I let go of this weird paranoid thought?

2022-11-12 07:18:45,Anxiety,"I'm an average 30 year old male and I just would like to share my anxiety recovery, although just like I said in the title I don't like this way of viewing the topic.
I had really big anxiety problems for about ten years, and when I say big I mean every single day living like shit, I'm not joking, I couldn't remember a day when I felt normal. I had pretty much all syntoms of generalized anxiety disorder, headaches, palpitations, stomach pain, sweating like a pig, vision problems and the list goes on..
I've been with I think 3 or 4 different therapists, I've seen 3 psychiatrists, been on antidepressant / sedatives like Xanax and also antipsicotics, that somehow helped me go through life and work.
Now what I think in my modest opinion we all go wrong when we talk about anxiety is that we are looking for a solution, a way to feel better, to not feel anxious when we shouldn't be and this is the big problem. I found out myself that there is no solution, because there is no problem to solve, the problem arise because we THINK it's a problem, it's really that simple. So ok, we all are aware that anxiety is caused by some kind of wrong way of thinking , and here is the little ""secret"" that worked for me. Just imagine an episode where you were anxious and felt all the terrible sensations, what were you upset about? Your way of thinking? Of course not, you were upset about the bad sensations you felt in your body, and no matter what you could think or do about it, you couldn't  make them disappear. And THAT is the little bubble where anxiety lives and grows. Because it does not go away just like that, in those moments we became anxious because we EXPECT that the syntoms would go away just by thinking or doing something (like breathing slowly or meditating ecc) about making  them go away.  The next time you feel anxious and start asking why you feel like this, (becouse if you didn't, you wouldn't have an anxiety DISORDER right? XD) Just leave that syntoms there, DO NOT EXPECT them to go away because they won't and GO ON with your life.
You will magically see that after some time doing this, the problem of anxiety will be gone, because, after all, you were making up the problem!
And this is the key in my opinion to all bad  feelings, sadness, lonliness, depression.. Just think about it : why we never think about why we are happy when we are happy? Just because that is a good sensation, not a bad one! But after all they are all the same, just sensations! 
P. S. Just to let you know, I dropped all of my medications and live a normal life, ups and downs, like every human being :)
Hope to have switched a light for someone of you, and pardon for my English, it's  not my first language :)",I've beaten my anxiety but I haven't

The lights were too bright, my head began to pound with one of the worst headaches ive had. This was only in the first store!!!! I bolted out of the store like some kind of lunatic, now severely nauseous, and my head feeling like its on fire, both inside and on the out. Im dizzy, about to pass out, my legs are not only shaking but also totally cramping up and clenched. I cant see straight and my eyes feel swollen. I decide to try another store, i can only make it one foot inside, im looking at the products but my mind isnt comprehending anything im reading. Then comes the boost of adrenaline, my hearts racing, my heads aching, annnnnd i run out

Finally at the third store, i see something i want, pick it up and immediately go to the cash register, im picking my fingers, stretching my legs constantly, im hot, im sweating through a simple t shirt in fall. Its cold in the store. I buy it, and i must have ran, again like a fucking lunatic. At this point im physically ill, my legs dont feel right, my head is aching so bad i dont even feel like i can drive.

Went out to eat on the way back because why not make this day worse, i run out leaving halfway through my meal and just leave too much money on the table (i know i covered the meal and the tip and a LOT extra) threw up outside the car, and then went home.

I know this is anxiety! Ive done every blood test. I am coming off Xanax and dealing with withdrawals but my anxiety has always been like this. Idk what to do at this point. I just keep trying and trying and trying and trying and dont give up but even doing this doesnt help, it really just makes me feel like shit about it. I feel like useless garbage at this point, im going to have to just shop online .  What can i do at this point, even now im mentally exhausted, i dont feel right at all. My legs are totally cramped up, and i can tell im clenching them together if that makes sense? My head feels spacey and numb and i still have a miserable headache.

As an anecdote, a friend's dog had to stay with another person for three months because they relocated temporarily and could not bring her. She began itching herself and licking herself until she developed skin infections. The vet attributed this to anxiety.

This happens to me. During the night I wake myself up with obsessive itching, and I cause myself skin damage and infections. These infections set me back psychologically such a long way.

Im tempted to pretend nothing is wrong and just hug and cuddle him as usual, but if we all get sick, I cant work and don’t have people to take care of me. On top of that the healthcare system here has collapsed to the point people have died waiting in ER.

For the past seven years, but it’s gotten to the point for the past four years specially I’ve had this rotting chest tightness. It feels heavy, it feels like the world is sitting on top of my chest. I can hardly breathe. It’s ALWYAS there. It feels like I have some sort of abnormality in my body and everyday I just have to ignore it and pretend I’m fine. My neck feels extremely tense like ALL of the time. I genuinely feel like someone is injecting concrete to my neck and it’s always drying and adjusting itself in my body. My whole body feels tense and I’m never comfortable, my legs and balance feels weak. I have this deep pit in my stomach all of the time like there’s this anxiety just SITTING there, like someone is just living inside of my body just rotting away and I have to live with that. It never ends. 

Mentally I’m constantly doing gymnastics in my head. I’m constantly thinking about every bad thing and person that has wronged me. And the worst part is that it’s 100% intrusive. I don’t CHOOSE to think about these things they are constantly just shoved into my face and my mind. Anger, jealousy, misery is always just fuming inside of me just waiting for something to fix it but nothing will. I keep on thinking about what others have and I don’t because I’m always so miserable. Something bad will happen to me and I will just obsess over it again and again and again and again. And my mind just won’t give up and it won’t give me any sort of relief. Life is just painful, and I don’t have any true moments of relief. I’m just surviving. 

I’ve tried meditating, I’ve tried medication, I’ve tried therapy and at best MAYBE therapy and meditation will give me a temporary release. But at the end of the day nothing significant. 

I don’t value anything about myself anymore. I hate my body and I hate that I’m gay. I feel completely useless. I just don’t see the point in living if I’m just waking up, going to work, being miserable, and coming home. The same shit over and over. The same intense emotions to the point where I think being in so much pain is just normal and that I don’t deserve happiness or love. I just feel like a floating piece of shit. 

The only time I’m happy is when I’m drunk and I think I’m becoming an alcoholic and I’m only 22. Life just sucks.",Everyday it feels like im being tortured and I’m ready to give up
2022-11-11 16:28:16,Anxiety,I had a upper and bottom scope done last year almost 12 months ago. It was fine. Been having acid reflux since I was 21 and I’m 34 this month. I had pizza today I’m careful what I had but it went down just fine no issue. Hours later I felt as if I had food back of my throat and it bothered me bad. Tried water. Nothing. It just stayed there and I forced myself to vomit and still there. Decided to go to the ER. They did a chest X-ray and told me it was fine and told me to get another endoscope and said to speak to my GI specialist. He prescribed me Sucralfate and still taking nexium before my first meal. I’m a bit scared that I might have dysphagia. I still have the feeling when I drink I feel it. Eating food feels weird. This all happen tonight. Any thoughts?,Might I have dysphagia?
2022-11-11 16:26:16,Anxiety,"I'm hoping someone can shed some light on their symptoms and share their list as well. 

I've been struggling with anxiety for more than half my life. I'm 36 now. It often manifests as health anxiety. 

But sometimes the physical symptoms I experience leave me astounded that this can be ""just anxiety"". It's so difficult drawing a line and going to the Dr and waiting it out.
I am going through a stressful time, starting to work in a month after being a house wife for 11 years as well as moving towns. But I try to be calm mostly. So can anxiety symptoms still present themselves even if I am not physically anxious? 
I'm not currently on medication nor have I ever been. But I'm seriously considering it because this is just getting too much for me.

I've diagnosed myself with every cancer, and serious illness under the sun in the past. The latest has been Multiple sclerosis. 
 I've been having tingles and odd feelings in different parts. It almost always sorts itself out after 24h. But can come back in a different location but never lasts overly long. I've had tingles in my nose, right side off my body, left hand fingers.
I go through periods of dizziness and vertigo.
I'm irratable and snappy.
My shoulders are always tense, I have to tell myself to release them and relax multiple times a day. 
I've been getting left sided little shocks in my head and feels like behind my eye. 
I'm tired. 
Last night before bed my thoughts were racing and I jerked awake a few times.
Frequently need the bathroom.

This had just been the last couple of days. I know I'm not imagining these. They are real and it's tiresome always dealing with a physical symptom of sorts.

I made a Dr appointment next week just to be sure but it's so so so debilitating.

And then when I browse all the disorder subs on reddit that I've diagnosed myself with or google it's even worse because I match every symptoms.

In the past when I've gone to Dr's with symptoms they have always said it's anxiety. But this is just too much. 

Please, if anyone can relate of offer their experience it will be very much appreciated.","Is this really ""just anxiety"""

2022-11-11 16:12:02,Anxiety,"Hey, a year ago I had my first full blown panic attack (hyperventilated, shaking, crying, difficulty to breathe and toughts of dying) when my two day vomiting sickness began. I woke up, my heart started pounding, I got this horrible urge to vomit, panic attack ensued and I vomited for two days straight (I had this horrible feeling to vomit in my throat, not in the stomach so that was new and scary), went to the emergency room, got medicine and was better.. Then vomiting happened again a couple days later but prescribed medicine helped. Noone knows what happened but the only thing that made sense at the time was CHS because I smoked at the time.

From that point on, I didn't have a similar attack, never really smoked after (because of fear), however slowly I became more anxious about anything food related and odd feelings in my body. Now when my head starts hurting in an unfamiliar way I panic about what's going to happen.. same with random chest pains.. I have weird toughts about choking when eating something that needs more chewing... And it's just a growing feeling of dread each time.

I fear that this may escalate into something worse and want to prevent this.. Has anyone been experiencing something similar?",Anxious about health since I was sick

I was a bit high recently and i had an panic or anxiety attack (hard to breath, heart palpitations, racing heart, chest numbness, tight chest) and my arms seemed really thin (which wasn’t my problem) and moving them just looked weird. 
They didn’t seem to change in size when i moved them.
 I had lack of body perception, i didn’t know where my body parts were and i also wasn’t able to feel if im sitting up right or in an really awkward posture.

2022-11-11 15:49:44,Anxiety,"Hey y'all, so I recently lost my medicine for my GAD. (no more insurance for my anxiety ridden ass.) and my anxiety is through the roof more often than usual. And when my anxiety spikes, I get a whole list of GI (gastrointestinal) issues. 
Acid reflux.
Nausea.
Bloating.
Belching.
Flatulence.
And my absolute favorite (NOT)
Aerophagia. 

AEROPHAGIA is usually seen in CPAP users, or people who have sleep issues, they tend to swallow a lot in their sleep. Leading to excessive belching Farting and a ""bubbly feel in the throat"" in the mornings. 

Though, it's MEDICALLY normal to swallow air while talking, eating, drinking through a straw, etc. 

But Aerophagia happens when one swallows....too much air. 

When I get nervous, I tend to swallow HELLA air. It's a nervous habit, I try to counter it by drinking water, but I still subconsciously swallow, my mouth is dry AF and I'm just swallowing air. 

I get the urge to swallow so much, I wanna know how to battle that. 

Cause I hate being bloated and distended. 
It's so uncomfortable and it triggers my Emetophobia. (Fear of 🤢🤮) the emojis don't bother me lol. Anyway, it makes me feel as if I'm gonna get sick, then I don't and I'm cool...but it sticks around in my mind...that I just might...and that's....never good. Like ever. 
Last time that happens I had a panic attack so bad I was tingling from head to to toe, and I was literally curled up. I couldn't move. For hours. HOURS. (Yes I had my bf time it. I like to time them.) 

Anyway, does ANYONE happen to know how to battle the urge to swallow when nervous????? 

Please I would love some tips, this bloating is gonna fuckin be the death of me yo.

2022-11-11 14:19:59,Anxiety,"Hi all! So in January of 2021 I was diagnosed wigh GAD (finally) after having it all my life. I went into therapy and it was AMAZING, truly changed my life. Im not in it anymore but am starting again next spring because my anxiety is coming back, and while I’ve been able to manage it better than I thought, there’s a new symptom that is really bugging and freaking me out. 

So, I want to ask, does anyone ever feel like they’re “going insane”? Its the strangest feeling, like in a second my mind is full on racing and I’m looking around frantically afraid that my anxiety/panic attack is turning into a psychotic episode. Like it feels like I’m losing touch with reality and in any second I’m going to start seeing and hearing things. What makes it worse is that I’m a psychology student in uni so whenever I learn about psychosis and other psychotic disorders like schizophrenia, I freak out and panic that its going to be me one day. 

All I’m really asking for here is confirmation that I’m not going insane and that I’m not the only one who feels this. To anyone that does, I’m sorry. But I know that I’ll overcome it like any other symptom.",New anxiety symptom makes me afraid its something worse

2022-11-11 11:27:04,Anxiety,"hey all!

&amp;#x200B;

i am a very anxious person, and thought i was well versed in what panic attacks felt like for me, however, after today, i feel like i might be wrong. i had an episode today wherein i was being gently reprimanded by a teacher of mine, and while he was talking to me about how i wasn't putting in the work i needed to be putting in, i felt all the blood rush out of my head. as this happened, i got incredibly lightheaded, my vision started to go black, i lost my balance, and eventually all i could hear was blood rushing in my ears. he was able to sit me down and give me water, after which i regained my vision and hearing and was fine. i thought i was going to pass out (the lightheadedness felt very close to how i feel before i pass out due to heat or needles, which is common for me). however, this has never happened. every other time i've *thought* i've had a panic attack, they were far less severe - i get body shakes, sweating, and difficulty breathing, but never have i had my vision/hearing affected to this extreme, nor have i ever felt like i was going to pass out due to anxiety.

&amp;#x200B;

was just wondering if this was simply a more severe panic attack, or something else entirely? thanks!

I've also been dating someone for like 8 months and they have no idea. I need to tell them about me being Agnostic before telling them about him, or else they'll harass me for dating someone who's not a Christian. If I tell them I'm Agnostic after I tell them about him, they'll think it's his fault.

Very few people know these truths about me. I only have three friends who know both truths, and two live far away. The remaining friend who's close by is moving far away soon too. My boyfriend lives very far away too. 

I have to tell my parents soon because my mom keeps trying to get me to go out with ""nice Christian men"" but I'm taken and even if I weren't that's not what I'd be looking for.

I suffer from derealization a lot of the time; things I see everyday feel unfamiliar like as if I ended up on an alien planet. Sometimes I get scared like what if the world started spinning uncontrollably or what if I began floating off the ground or sinking into it. Also, my best friend died 6 months ago unexpectedly in her sleep at 22. Her and I used to talk about how scary death is and what happens after but we never really worried too much because we were still young but her death really solidified the fact that death doesn't care about how young or scared you are. I can't sleep at night anymore and I feel like my life is hanging on by a thread sometimes. I just want these feelings to be done with already.

I have been diagnosed with anxiety and don’t take any meds because they make me feel worse. But I noticed that at school I’ll smell something bad like B.O. or a tangy yet repugnant smell. I know it’s not me because I shower, wear deodorant and cologne and wear fresh clothes every day. I smell it almost every day and in almost every class. My doctor told me it’s not uncommon and in fact it’s called a phantom smell; which has been commonly linked to anxiety. So if you’re ever experiencing something similar, then there you go. It can be very irritating and my best advice is to just breathe through your shirt to reaffirm that you smell good. It also helps to ask a friend to check if you smell good. If that doesn’t help, then try washing your shoes; take out the soles and put them in your washing machine with a little bit of distilled vinegar and oxiclean. To dry, you can hang them up infront of a box fan and let them dry completely before using again. Hope someone else can relate and benefit from this.",Fear of smelling bad

So 2 Thursdays ago, I was doing doordash like a normal day.  I had an order at a sushi restaurant to pick up so I parked in the lot and walked in the restaurant.  The order wasn't ready so I started messing around on my phone while im standing around waiting. A couple mins go by and I decide to go sit in one of the chairs and wait.  A minute or so later I started feeling really uncomfortable.  I got very lightheaded and dizzy, break out in a sweat, my chest began to hurt and I started struggling to breathe, I began to feel very disassociated and scared thinking to myself ""am I having a heart attack?  Am I going to pass out, I think im passing out,  I should call out for help, I need help!""  And then suddenly the server tells me the order is ready, and then I snap to.  All of a sudden I'm back and I get up all shaken up I walk over and grab the order and then walk back to my car.  At this point I'm fine but now I'm so anxious and shaky like legit freaked out.   I keep thinking to myself  ""did I have a small heart attack or something?""  Like I legit almost passed out and now I'm ok just shaken up.  I finish the order and then in a panic thinking if it happens again I'll go to the hospital I go to a park that has a huge set of stairs up a hill.  I figure if I'm having a heart issue then climbing all these stairs (like 5 floors) then ill most likely start feeling like how I felt before again and if thay happens I'll go to the hospital immediately.  (Great mindset right?)  To my avail nothing happened and when I get to the top I feel good because of the exercise.  So I'm just baffled and I decide to call the rest of the day off.  I make an appointment with my Dr (not until this coming Monday unfortunately so if there is something wrong with me i wont know until then, although i doubt anything is physically and its all in my head) 

Now for context I've been under a lot of stress right now in a difficult living situation and I'm struggling to make ends meet atm.   But since this incident I have this 24/7 constant fear of something is about to happen to me like am i going to pass out or I'm feeling like my head is heavy or I just get anxious for no reason to the point where it has been affecting me from going out into public (for the record my main career is I'm a drummer ironically so I'm used to being on stage and performing for lots of people. I get nervous sometimes before playing but any stage performer will tell you a little nerves before the gig is normal. So I've never been anxious about making a fool of myself in front of people, that's why this is so baffling to me)

The only thing that has truly made me feel better is exercising.  For some odd reason going to face my fears directly and just work up a sweat a the gym just shuts out all those worries and what ifs for some time.   Unfortunately when I wake up the next day thought the overhlwhelming anxiousness returns...

Sorry this is so long but don't really know what I'm experiencing but I want to take my life back.

I’ve made a few small mistakes here and there that I’m pretty sure never even made it to her but recently I had a court thing I totally spaced clocking out for. She spoke with me about it, expressed concerns, fixed my time sheets blah blah. Mind you that was like two weeks ago. Anyways a week goes by after our convo and I’m super anxious about getting fired. For context, we’re all pretty close here so I felt comfortable sitting down with her and flat out asking if I’m getting fired. She laughed and asked if I was kidding lol. She told me I’m not getting fired etc, I opened up a lot about my anxiety and things going on in my personal life. She told me if anything and it doesn’t work back here we can re-evaluate me going back to the clinic. She told me there’s always a spot for me here and she even told me she loved me and hugged me🥺 anyways, I still can’t shake the feeling &amp; I guess I just need some reassurance/advice.

2022-11-11 07:58:07,Anxiety,"Hello all!

I was recently diagnosed with GAD. But I don't feel like I am an excessively worried person. I do sometimes experience a lot of anxiety, but right now I'm just trying to get myself to accomplish more in my day to day life. 

Initially I thought that I might have the inattentive type of ADHD, but I wasn't diagnosed for that because I didn't have any issues in school/behaviorally as a child. 

I do spend a lottttt of time doing research on things, because I feel that research can help me feel confident about making decisions. I am also extremely indecisive and I often have a hard time making a decision about something even after doing hours of research. 

I feel like I've been stuck in a loop of not feeling motivated to do anything (things I enjoy doing, spending time with friends, going outside, tending to my home, daily habits, etc.)

And so I waste a lot of my time self-distracting and then feeling really ashamed, guilty, regretful, annoyed &amp; frustrated later for not doing more with my time.

But then I do it again. I do this whenever I have ""free time"". When I am around others I feel obligated to be more productive &amp; thus it's easier for me to get things done. I'm fine when I'm at work because I know that I need to meet certain expectations for a paycheck. 

When it's just me, I feel like I can't complete anything because tasks feel too difficult/overwhelming, not important enough, or I just have no interest in completing the task (even when it's part of something that I actually want completed).

I can technically ""push through"" and get things done, but then I'm just filled with dread &amp; I don't want to have to feel that way in order to get things done. Since I can't find a way to feel ""good"" or even ""okay"" about doing things, I've just started avoiding everything. I live with my fiancé and this has obviously effected our relationship because I'm not helping out as much as I can, even when I have the time to. 

I'm extremely unhappy with myself &amp; I'm in therapy, but I don't feel like I'm making much progress. 

Can anyone relate to this?

2022-11-11 07:13:57,Anxiety,"Lemme tell ya, I've never been beyond anxious in social situations or something that was pretty note-worthy of being actually stressed, throughout my childhood years (I have been diagnosed with Depression/Anxiety/OCD/ADHD/Tourrets/GERD) - Between the span of 5 and 10 years of age. 

Never have I been concerned with my health, nor did I experience panic attacks. I wasn't worried about this, worried about that, not even when the pandemic began. My mindset was just - 'Hey it happens. It happens. Move on along.' - So, to suddenly say that my life is now like a car, that had been thus 'Yeeted' off a cliff and hit everything on the way down, would be an understatement. 

Started just the first month of this year, had what I thought (Was A Death Experience) which turned out to just be a panic attack, that had me feel super off for a few days, but I managed to recover, get bloodwork done, CT, you know, all the works to rule out any other issues. During all of this, I had more and more frequent panic/fluctuation in my anxiety. 

Gotta go take a shower? - Let's have an anxiety attack.
Gotta go get some groceries? - I'll just wait till you get inside the store first.
Feeling off? - Oh, you're definitely dying.

It made me self-evaluate (Health Conscious) Checking eyes, hair, skin, anything and everything to see if something is wrong. Which is mentally taxing, because I feel like I 'Have/Need' to do it, despite another more rational part of my brain telling me ""You're fine. Stop fixating"" which is easier said then done. 

I was put on Buspar, which didn't last long. Dose was upped, didn't last long, so I was switched to Celexa, which helped clear up my depression, didn't do a thing for my anxiety. So, I was taken off of that. Currently in therapy. 

Meanwhile, my anxiety has gotten to the point where I'm having nearly daily attacks, I am dissociating/depersonalizing, fearful majority of the time, I lose sense of my own emotions to the point I don't feel like myself anymore or that I'm going crazy. Fatigued, foggy, you name it, I've experienced it. 

Just a few days ago, I've had a pretty bad scare (Thought I was having a allergic reaction to an antibiotic, but might have just been my anxiety reaching the limits) which the antibiotic itself, is known to cause 'Floxed' which made me webMD and you know, automatically assume that I've been floxed and think my life is over. Made a trip to ER, explained to them, doctor didn't seem concerned about being floxed and gave me a higher dose of Buspar. Which eased me up a bit, not 100% but it did do something for my anxious/stress state that I was currently in. 

I've been on a round of steroids/Benadryl too (For the reaction scare) which made everything worse for me. I just feel out of it one minute, clear the next, then out of it again. Weak. Worried. Scatter brained. Random aches. Which led to me thinking ""Oh, I've been floxed for sure"" when really, it's just my anxiety getting the better of me (Getting worse) because go figure, if I'm not thinking about these things, I don't fixate and then I just don't experience these things. Which are worse at night/waking up.

The scare really just made everything worse. I'm not as bad today, but I'm still not 100%. I went ahead and grabbed out my Buspar that I've kept just in case, taking those. I can feel the tension in my jaw/back of my head or certain muscles. I'm depersonalizing. No appetite yet (Though I can eat) morning is the worst for me because my senses are not fully aware yet, which causes me to automatically panic (Think I'm dying) especially when I feel like I'm numb, when I'm really just not fully awake or I'm just anxious as I wake up because I'm looking for problems straight away. 

It sucks. It really does and my anxiety just has setback after setback. When I think I made a breakthrough, I get thrown and crushed. I have doctor's, family (Especially my mom) who remind me (Calm down. It's you're anxiety.)  

But to sum it up, for those who may want to know how I feel/experience at my worst. Here ya go:

Dizzy/lightheaded - Usually when moving around.
No appetite/or super hungry - Either not hungry or very hungry.
Emotional/Moodswing - Depends how stressed I am feeling.
Dissociation/Derealization - Feel like I'm not real or my surroundings.
Tingling/numbness/sensitivity - Worse when waking up/Thinking about it.
Brain fog/hard to concentrate - Usually after an episode or when I'm anxious. Depression don't help.
Tension/Random Aches/Headaches/Heaviness - It depends on how stressed I am. 
Worry/Doom/Obsessive - Especially when I'm at my Lowest. 
Flushing/Hot flashes - When I get very anxious. 
Blurry Vision/Lights/Flashes - Worse when I notice them. 
Trouble swallowing/Globus sensation/Chest tightness - Depends.
Trouble sleeping - Depends. My anxiety is at it's peak at night.
Dull Senses - Touch seems off. Taste. Smell. 
Weakness/Shaky - Legs feel heavy/jello, but I can move around, do general activities just fine. 
Questioning sanity - Think I'm going crazy.
Dry mouth - Especially when I'm talking to someone new, like a doctor/therapist.
Body Feelings - Could just be another form of dissociation. But I can touch my face/look at any parts of my body and just feel like something is off. Like some sort of unique filter. Which sets my anxiety through the roof. 
Picking/Thinning/Can't sit still - I am losing hair, I pick at my scalp, pick the skin on my fingers.

2022-11-11 06:42:06,Anxiety,"Hey all,

Long story made short. Break up 3 years ago. Immediately after developed anxiety. Became Lonely AF, constantly going between several unsuccessful relationships, working a job I despise, living with people that infuriate me, used weed edibles (1st time user).

Basically, a bunch of environmental aspects brought me down. Weed edibles helped... and then didn't. Especially for anxiety disorders. I'd find myself anxious, OCD, and constantly fixated on ""issues"". All of this happening during COVID.

Depression became worse July 2021. Hated my environment, wanted to move, get a new job, get new friends, get a girlfriend, etc. I was alone and very unhappy. Then I went into the ER for a panic attack I mistook as a heart attack. That made me fixate my anxiety, on my health.

Since, I've gone from: cancer fear, heart issues, thyroid issues, schizophrenia fear, neurological degeneration fear, dementia fear (I'm 26), ALS fear, etc. Several blood tests, several specialists, several support systems. Diagnosed with Health Anxiety OCD.

After I got the results that my heart was normal this year. I came utterly, completely, chemically depressed. The whole nine yards, one thing that happened as well was insomnia. A innate, chemical, type of insomnia. Which has only been exacerbating all of my mental health issues.

My doctors want me to begin antidepressants. But I keep feeling new symptoms each day.

**These days my symptoms are: waking up feeling** ***head sick***\*\*, feeling sick, fearing that I'm dying of an undiagnosed illness, belief that my issues are not related to anxiety or depression, stomach pains, nausea, tremors, coordination issues, bumbling hands, etc\*\*But I'm as sharp as tick. Still hanging out with friends. I do take supplements to help me get through the day.

2022-11-10 15:12:36,Anxiety,"Hey guys new to Reddit so I’m not too sure how this all works lol. Anyways…

I been smoking every night or so for about a year. Obvi some days I’d smoke through out the day. Before eating a meal, you know how it goes. So I’d say I would be a daily weed user. 

I realized I started having anxiety just about life. Never a attack but just anxious. Started to worry about health and so on, even though I am extremely healthy. 

Had an attack once while I was high but it was short lived. Only lasted around 5-10 mins. But still continued smoking. 

I would be anxious while on weed but I would just toss it to the side without thinking much about it until the bad trip happened 

I took two bong rips and I took a 10mg edible then fell asleep. 

I woke up feeling soooo weird and felt anxiety building up. Then it happened full mental breakdown for like 2 hrs I was shaky, dry mouth, cold, all of the bad. Just freaking out. I was able to relax and go back to sleep after like 4-6 hours (don’t remember)

After that I didn’t touch weed ever again 

The first week: it was rough. I felt anxiety throughout the day because of the experience I just went through, I would feel the same mini symptoms before I had the anxiety attack. (Note) I’m not an anxious person so this was new to me. I thought something was wrong with me lol

2nd week still rough same as above trying to become myself, trying to keep my mind busy and not think about the experience a lot. I realized I started getting anxious when it was around 6-7pm because that was the time I would usually start smoking

I work from home so that didn’t help escape my thoughts

3rd week it’s all still coming together starting to feel like myself again mild anxiety symptoms but I’ve been fighting it strongly some days are harder than the rest kinda like a up and down chart

Fast forward to today 1 month and 2 weeks I’m starting to feel like myself again! :) I’m on my 10th day in a row on the waking up app for meditation. Learning to deal with overwhelming thoughts. Learning how to deal with my anxiety every day becoming stronger and stronger! Don’t get me wrong I still feel anxiety but I’m learning to deal with the emotion day by day, like today I felt like my body was heavy but started to focus on my breathing and realized I’m okay :)

2022-11-10 15:09:10,Anxiety,"Hi everyone, apologies for the long post but this has been bothering me for a long time.

I've noticed shaking / a slight tremor for over a year now when doing certain activities or doing fine movements. For example, when holding my phone up in bed or putting my arms up above my head when standing and controlling them down to my sides again, my shoulder muscles shake slightly. Another example is when standing on my tippy toes and bringing my heel back to the ground in a controlled manner, it's not smooth, instead, it's sort of shaky through my lower legs? Does anyone else get these? It's always during a rather slow controlled movement. I'm so hyperfocused on this now I don't know what's normal and what isn't anymore.

I’ve noticed since then that my upper arms get tired very easily, and when I do the slightest exertion with my muscles, they shake as if they are strained (like the day after a workout) and I'm jittery quite often. 

I have severe health anxiety and worry it's neurological but my doctors don't think it's anything and all of my bloods came back normal. Private neurologists near me have a 4-6 month waiting time, and I'm kinda terrified because I worry that my body is degenerating. I still have the strength to do everything I used to e.g. opening things and lifting things, I just shake sometimes like my muscles are easily fatigued.  

As background info, I'm 21M and used to be very fit but mainly stopped exercising 4-5 years ago when I took up tech studies.  Could this just be due to lack of exercise + stress? Have you experienced similar?

2022-11-10 14:52:31,Anxiety,"I have a very specific and irrational fear of sounds, specifically the vibrations they make. For example: I want to mount my tv to the wall but the thought of it producing vibrations through my apartment and even affecting my neighbors bring me extreme anxiety, dread and even panic. I don’t know why. I don’t like loud sounds sometimes, but it’s very selective because I also love going concerts and seeing movies. 

If I think about how loud and how much the building vibrates during a concert or movie (much more likely to happen if I don’t care for the artist or movie) I start to panic and have a need to bury my head in my knees and plug my ears, or get away from the noise. Sometimes it even stops me from seeing a movie if I’m feeling particularly sensitive that day. 

I try to use logic and think of the little physics knowledge I have to try to calm myself down. I’ve been this way since I can remember, but I don’t know if I have phonophobia because not every loud sound or situation bring me panic, I honestly can’t predict what will trigger it. Sometimes I can watch a movie on my tv or in theatres with no problem, but other times I have to calm myself down, also in fear of burdening those around me by wanting to leave. I’ve even had to ask my family to turn down the tv when watching an action movie before, that time it was because the bass was too strong and the frequencies were too high.

Bass and high frequencies especially trigger my panic, I’m afraid of what they do to buildings and also my ears. 

My fear can be debilitating, I have an anxiety disorder, so I’m well aware of my usual anxiety, but the panic that noises give me is especially extreme.

Last week, someone in our house tested positive for RSV. Today, my girlfriend tested positive for Covid, and I tested positive for the flu. Both of us tested negative for everything else (I tested negative for covid, she tested negative for the flu).

So here we are, festering in this pit of the different sicknesses from three different sources. We have no idea who have who what, who had it first, and what stage were at. I’m so fucking sick of people spreading their disease because of a misguided and silly interpretation of “freedom”. I’m sick of constantly avoiding being sick again. 

I just want everyone to go inside and stay the fuck away from me, and I hate how selfish that desire is.",I want to go back to a nationwide shutdown.

Soon as  i stuff my face it goes away. Its a really uncomfortable feeling. I had breakfast like an hour before though. I have also had my blood sugars done in the past and it’s all come back fine.

2022-11-10 14:22:32,Anxiety,"Every single day I walk on eggshells around everyone. I get terrified to wave or speak, yet I force myself to in order to not seem awkward. It doesn't help that everyone seems to be more reclusive for some reason and my efforts to engage in conversation lead to being ignored or being stared at. A normal social interaction feels like me being obliged to keep the other person happy. I'm so sick of it all. 

I can't even do basic normal tasks I could do with ease 2-3 years ago because asides from the social aspect, these overwhelming feelings have seeped into my daily life to the extent that I feel like I am in an inescapable orbit around a black hole of doubt of doom; never actually being sucked in, and constantly orbiting around and awaiting whatever doom and doubt await me. I absolutely dread conversations, I am so awkward even when I try not to, and everyone has such a cold reaction. I have never felt more alone in my entire life. I'm sick of it all, I just want to leave everything behind and move away. 

What can I do? I know that I should love myself, be my own best friend, practice mindfulness, and look inside instead of outside, but it's like I'm constantly being pushed to the very edge every single time I try to fight. I doubt this will get any responses due to the length and vagueness, but I really needed this venting.

2022-11-10 14:10:33,Anxiety,"I'm a pretty serious hypochondriac. You name it and at some point, I've been convinced it was killing me. My major fears are neurological illnesses, particularly dementia. I'm 33 years old.

Today I got asked to run an errand, it was out of the blue and really interrupted my day. I was already in an anxiety spiral when I got asked. I ended up having to rush through my workout, shower, and hop in the car. 

The place I was going was just off a road I drive all the time, like 2-3 times a week at least. I do delivery work on the side so I do a LOT of driving. 

When I left, I knew where I needed to go and what road to take. But for some reason I placed the road I needed to turn on in the wrong area, like a mile away from where it actually is. I planned the route in my head and could see myself making that (wrong) turn and it being the correct road. It was not.

I drove that way, was distracted and drove past this wrong street. When I turned around to come back to it, I realized it was the wrong road. I got confused and panic hit me. I ended up just heading back to a nearby main road to reorient and realized what I'd done wrong and sort of parsed out the way I needed to go.

This ended up setting off a real panic because for a minute there I was truly, genuinely confused about how I'd screwed up and which way to go. However, I drive the area all the time! The road I needed is one I take about 3 times a week.

Has anyone else done anything like this? I've asked people I know but they just say ""oh yea I drive past my turn all the time"". What I'm talking about isn't that, I literally could visualize the correct road and knew I needed it but put it in the wrong place and went there!

Just need to vent to others that get it. Could the fact that I was already anxious about other stuff have caused this? Does your anxiety ever produce confusion?","Got confused about directions, set off fear of young onset dementia, anyone else have this?"

2022-11-10 12:53:59,Anxiety,"So I got prescribed 5mg diazepam for severe anxiety attacks. They don’t happen often maybe once ever 3-4 months and I take half a tablet around 2.5mg when it does happen just to help me rest through the night and usually I’m fine the next day( I take 10-20mg propanolol for anxiety daily). 

I have found now though that for bigger social occasions where alcohol is involved (alcohol triggers my anxiety so I stay sober) I can take 2.5 mg and have a great time, especially work related networking events. The propanolol gets me through a normal day and helps with the physiological effects of anxiety however in bigger social settings the diazepam helps calm me psychologically so I can be myself.

2022-11-10 12:09:20,Anxiety,"I just visited a psych ward because of an anxiety spiral combined with a deep depression. I had a really weird stress response. I talked to the psychologist about it and he said it was pretty rare, but he didn't have a name for it. I plan on getting a therapist to try and help me figure out what happened, but I don't know if it's even in something like the DSM-5.

I was super depressed and anxious. a few days into my stay, I started spacing out really bad. I would just stare at the same spot for up to 10 minutes strait while ""stimming"". I didn't feel bored at all while I was doing this. Eventually I walked into my room and sat down at the desk.

Here's where things took a weird turn. I decided to fold my cloths as neatly as possible. It felt REALLY good. I'm not sure when it started, but I was talking to myself constantly. I was mouthing the words and even whispering them sometimes. For some reason, the monologue in my head was all positive affirmation stuff. I would think things like ""I'm a nice guy, and Claudia is really nice, and I love it when she smiles, and it's okay if I don't fold my cloths perfectly, because no one is perfect, and that's okay.""

I'm a positive guy, but I hate that kind of self talk for some reason. It was very out of character for me. I felt like some kind of amplified, childish version of myself. I felt different enough that I was trying to think of a new name for my this new self!

While I was in this state, I wasn't able to have negative thoughts. I couldn't bring up any sad memories. I wasn't able to bring up any images or sound to my consciousness e.g. songs, or visual memories. My consciousness was just a monologue of self affirmation! I didn't feel depressed or anxious at all.

Eventually some small part of me realized this wasn't normal. I struggled to look people in the eyes and start conversations, but after about 20 minutes of sitting near the front desk, I was finally able to tell one of the nurses that something was wrong. She had never heard of something like what I was experiencing, and since I wasn't a danger to myself or anyone else, she told me to talk to the psychiatrist in the morning. I think it was 1am, so they gave me something to help me fall asleep.

When I woke up in the morning, I was still stimming, but was otherwise back to my normal self. I told the psychiatrist what had happened. He said it was pretty rare, but didn't have a name for it. He and the nurses thought it was actually a good thing, since I was being SUPER positive, and was able to snap out of it after sleeping. I was really scared I would keep falling into this other self, and not be able to live the kind of life I'm used to. Thankfully it seems to only happen at times of extreme stress, so I'm not too worried about it. It only happened that one time.

After talking to some people in the psych ward, I think I may be on the autism spectrum. It might be the case that the stress caused me to regress to a time when I wasn't as well adjusted. I plan on getting tested for autism, because it describes me so well.

2022-11-10 10:20:33,Anxiety,"I am a people pleaser. All I wanted growing up was to make my mom and dad proud and to earn their affection. I wanted to show them I was worth having (I didn’t grow up with them because of a substance abuse and physical abuse). Instead I grew up with my grandmother. I love her but she is also the cause of a lot of my mental illnesses including my anxiety. 

And so my goal growing up was, naturally, to please my grandmother and to also earn her affection. 
One thing one should know about my grandmother is that she is always keen to let everyone be aware of what she thinks. It’s not uncommon for her to let me know every other day or so how disappointment she’s w me. Even w small insignificant things. A few examples are, not turning on/off a string of lights on the balcony, not putting her bed cover outside to air out, I used the robot vacuum she bought to clean kitchen/hallway instead of using the manual vacuum. And more serious examples like deciding (more like asking) to see friends within a short period of time, following my friend as support during her abortion and lending my mom money for her to get home via taxi. All are times I’ve made my grandmother disappointed. 

(Another little juicy example, when I got hired at my new job over a month ago, after being unemployed for two months. She didn’t say she was proud, didn’t say she was happy for me, didn’t even say that it was good for me. But continued saying that if I hadn’t got the job we would need to have a long discussion about my future and getting a job within care. Which I absolutely dread. Even my boyfriends parents were so much more supportive and happy for me)

But I have communicated to her in the past how important it is for me to feel that others are proud of me. But she always tells me she doesn’t understand why that matters and the most important thing is that I am proud of me. Sounds about right. But yet I’m being told by her that her opinion of me matters greatly and if I don’t respect her opinions I can just move out. 

Anyways, the reason for me writing this at all. I did something insignificant the other day, don’t even remember what. And my grandmother told me that she was proud of me. And I felt nothing. No excitement. No happiness. No feeling of being proud of myself. Hearing her say that felt absolutely nothing. It didn’t feel bad, like hearing her being angry with me but it also didn’t even make me feel good about myself. It was like she didn’t even say it to me but to herself. For herself to hear that she was proud of me. And it was nothing to me. Something I want to hear all the time and it was like nothing. Even the words had no spark to them if that makes sense. 

That was all, just needed to rant a bit.",I don’t feel anything when people say they are proud of me.

Suddenly I'm having heart palpitations, random chest pains (had an EKG done following my last panic attack, doctors said my heart is perfectly healthy), I feel restless practically every day and it feels like I'm living in constant fear of another panic attack. I have never had anxiety this bad in my life.

After doing some digging it seems like other buspirone users have had similar side effects, is it possible that my meds are causing this? Or maybe my anxiety overall has worsened and my meds just can't help me anymore. I forgot to take one of my pills this morning and I honestly felt great until this afternoon and suddenly had a big rush of symptoms come over me all at once. 

Has anyone been in a similar situation? I am calling my doctor tomorrow.",How do I tell if my medicine is making my anxiety worse?

2022-11-10 10:02:38,Anxiety,"I just needed to share this with someone. Anyone.

I'm at my final year at uni right now. And I'm in an internship. Every semester I have to hand in a report about it to my undergraduate course's office. Today I accessed the website in which I have to turn my report in just to discover that I missed the deadline to register my internship (yeah, i have to do it every semester). I had to do it by october 31st.

And now I'm just freaking out.

I can't get in touch with the office's secretary because she's on vacation and she'll only return next week. 

I don't know what my professor (who's my internship advisor) would be able to do.

And even if I emaild one (or both of them), I'm scared they'll just tell me to go to my course's coordinator to solve it.

He can definitely solve my problem.

But the thing is... He's not an easy person to talk to. If you're wrong (which I am) he'll eat you alive. He'll solve your problem. But at the cost of a chunck of your well-being.

And a coupl of weeks ago I had to go to him to solve another problem regarding another missing deadline. And yes, he beat the shit out of me.

I am freaking scared to go to him again WITH THE SAME PROBLEM but with a different area this time. I'll be eaten alive.

I know I'm in the wrong. But I just can't go to him right now. I know I'll just... break. Somehow.

I really hate confrontations.

Now my anxiety is all worked up, I can't solve anything right now (because it's night here atm), in the end I'll probably have to talk to my coordinator (the only step which I absolutely don't want to do).

2022-11-10 09:23:55,Anxiety,"Hey everyone, sorry that I’m doing this on a throwaway account.

The past couple months I have had anxiety in relation to driving has been off the charts. Most related to forgetting the last couple kms and thinking I have gone through a red light or caused and accident or something. Causing a lot of anxiety and catasrophizing. 

I drive a lot for work, typically 800km (500 miles) a month. And I have a 20 minute commute each way for work, mostly highway driving, and have been doing that for a number of years. I’ve always had highway hypnosis to some extent because the drive is so boring, but never had the anxiety until recently.

Today for an example I’m driving home on the highway, following traffic, and I get about 400m up the road and look in the rear view mirror and notice there is no traffic following me (I was following traffics right in front of me though). I then notice an suv speeding up the highway behind me. My brain immediately goes into catastrophizing that I ran a red light and caused an accident and this person in the suv is following me to get my license plate. So I decide to take a left at the next intersection to circle back and drive through the previous light again to check. Well the suv is now right behind me in the turn lane. I turn left and I go down a block to do a uturn and come back up to the highway to turn right and go back the way I came, we’ll I guess the suv did the same thing and now I’m behind this suv. 

Needless to say my anxiety peaked when I notice they did a uturn as well and felt like they followed me. 

Rationally speaking I know it’s probably a coincidence and that I would have 100% noticed if I ran a red light and/or caused an accident, but my anxiety is just full fledged taking over. I’ve had a couple of these episodes over the past couple months and it’s a trend I’m not super fond of.

2022-11-10 09:20:10,Anxiety,"A couple of days ago I felt like I had something in my throat after I ate, which happens to me a lot due to acid reflux, so I spent the next few hours desperately trying to clear it and cough, but it didn't really help so I gave up and went to sleep. I woke up yesterday with a wheezy cough, which I assumed was from the excessive clearing the night before. The cough lasted all day and I assumed it would be gone today. I woke up today and now the cough is worse, still productive-ish (sometimes dry, sometimes wet), and now I have a low grade fever that's been ramping up for the past few hours. I'm terrified that I have COVID, or the flu. I haven't been sick since 2019, so I'm getting really scared. I took a COVID test and it was negative. I would have been potentially exposed 5 days ago, but no one else that I was with is sick.   


I really thought I just irritated my throat with the clearing and coughing, but now that I have a fever and a massive headache, I'm not sure that was it. I'm on Lexapro and used to take Advil for headaches because I trusted it, but I can't take that now due to the Lexapro. I've never taken Tylenol (stupid to be scared about, I know) and I'm worried I'll have some kind of adverse reaction. This headache is terrible though, and headaches are one of my main health anxiety triggers. Sorry this is a frantic post, I'm just really scared right now. I'm fully vaccinated against COVID, but I'm still worried that if I do have it, it'll be severe for some reason. I'm trying so hard not to freak out about this, tell myself it's fine, no one else in my house is sick so it's likely nothing too serious or contagious, but it's so hard to calm down when I feel like this. I guess I'm just seeking reassurance right now.","I've been coughing and now I have a fever, getting scared"
2022-11-10 09:18:06,Anxiety,"I've found that lately my anxiety starts to spiral with a certain ""feeling."" All of the sudden my body/brain will start to think something is wrong, and then I'll start freaking out for no reason (high heart rate, sweating, can't sit still), and then this feeling will cause me to start feeling like everything I'm doing or seeing is wrong. It's hard to explain. It's like I will start to question my reality and everything will still feel ""wrong"" at the same time. There's no relief from it, I usually just have to wait for it to pass but it's absolute hell. I know it passes because this has been happening for the last year or so off and on.

Or.... sometimes I will be doing something and I'll start to get scared that I will start feeling that way again, and the fear will actually put me in that mental and physical place again.

I know it doesn't help that I'm currently going through a really hard time in my personal life. I lost all my friends last year, I have no friends in the city I'm in so I'm always by myself. And I work from home. None of this started happening until about a year ago and when I had a ""normal life"" I never felt this way. I'm sure it wouldn't be as bad if I was around people more often.
I was just curious if this is normal with anxiety because I've looked on Reddit and I can't find any posts that explain my specific symptoms.

Another way to describe it is like being on high alert and not trusting anything in my surroundings, even though I normally don't feel that way. Like I'm a different person or something is wrong. I understand that it could also be impending doom, however I've never heard of that being associated to not trusting your surroundings or your own actions. It's almost like I question everything and nothing could be real because I don't feel ""normal"" so how can I trust everything I'm seeing or doing to be normal when my own mental state doesn't feel normal.

For instance if I'm working while having these symptoms, I will start freaking out that I read something wrong on my computer screen and because of that I will do something wrong, despite having no evidence that this is true. Like I KNOW I'm not reading things wrong. But I FEEL worried that I am, and that fear doesn't go away even though I know it's irrational. It's like I'm being controlled by these feelings that come and go and sometimes I get scared once it passes, that it's going to happen again and the cycle continues.

I can't distract myself because that ""off feeling"" is all I think about and it's subconscious. It fades eventually but it feels like I'm never gonna get through it when it starts happening.. And it lasts for days, makes me feel like I can't function. Everyone in my life has told me it's anxiety but I've never seen posts with these specific symptoms and somehow I'm worried that means  I'm ""going crazy.""

2022-11-10 09:06:00,Anxiety,"Hi. I'm 30. Male. Been working at this job for 5 years. I haven't been able to sleep very well due to some guilt, and the fear of being punished for something I did at work. It's been a rough few weeks for me. 

I have not actively told a lie. But I have knowingly withheld information that I probably should have mentioned. 

I'll try to cut as much detail as possible: 

I use a machine at work. The machine has been giving me incorrect results. These results are not necessarily the end of the world but its slowing down production overall. At first my boss said that there was no other explanation than me simply feeding things in to the machine wrong. I knew I had been doing it correctly, but I went with it since I couldn't prove it. 

I let my supervisor (my boss's wife) observe how i put things in to the machine, and she herself acknowledged that it was correct. So they are getting someone to come take a look at it. 

However...I started to think on it, and I have a feeling I know what's going on. A physical adjustment of the machine had been made at some point. To do this, someone would have had to unscrew a certain bracket, shifted it, and then screwed it back down tightly. It's not something that can happen by accident. I do have memory of grabbing the wrenches we would use to make such an adjustment. And I do remember being at the machine with them. 

This issue has caused a certain degree of setback for the whole workplace, despite us being able to remain on schedule as usual. It's not a night and day difference, but it is a difference. I think my boss would have a right to be upset if the repairman comes and he points out that someone must have moved a bracket. 

I've kept quiet, even though I really think at this point that it must have been me. 

***Humor me for a moment****.* Let's say this is exactly the case. Let's say it was 100% me who made the adjustment and caused a bunch of frustration for everyone. Let's assume this is already the case. It's going to feel like a lie no matter what I say. If my boss says essentially ""You are the only one who uses this. How else could it have moved?"", all I know to say is ""Yes, it must have been me. But i don't remember doing it."" That sounds like such a lie, considering the deliberateness of such an action. I've also thought about saying ""Well, I can't contest it"", and just accept whatever judgment there is. I feel like I'm having to rehearse this whole thing the way I'd rehearse making up excuses to my teachers why my huge book report wasn't finished. 

It's really eating away at me, especially considering my boss has a temper. He isn't this generally angry person by any means, but when something goes wrong, he's short fused. I remember one instance where he opened the door to the room as was in, saw what I was doing, laughed in this ""you've gotta be kidding me"" sort of way and walked off. He's coldly told me my work ""looks like shit"" and that I need to redo it until its right - only for everyone to realize it was due to the materials I was given. He has hollered at other workers when he didn't see enough products coming down the conveyer belt. I've heard him clapping his hands, and laughing, saying ""I can't fucking BELIEVE this"" in response to some other workers. I do not know the context. 

The point I'm making is... I just want a peace of mind. Just a little peace of mind will do. I feel guilty. I'm sure it was me. And that's a conclusion I come to even in my most sober states of mind. I want to be able to find contentment even if something bad happens to me or my job.","I think I may have been lying to my boss for a while, and now I'm in a panic about the repercussions."
2022-11-10 09:04:16,Anxiety,"Its been a long, long, long 4 months. I (M23) started getting weird neck symptoms and then shortly afterward i developed strange headaches about 4 months ago. The headaches have not stopped since. Its been constant, all day, every day, and they’re weird. I feel them in my ears and around my eyes. Often times i feel them in my face.

The strange headache symptoms made my pcp and i think it was sinus related. Wait a month to see an ENT. He schedules a sinus CT. Wait three weeks for the CT cause insurance was being uncooperative. I thought for sure id have a sinus infection. At the time nothing else made sense. But no, the CT was clear. I felt so invalidated.

Not too long after this i was hanging out with my my gf. Her mother, who’s a Physical Therapist, saw me rubbing my neck, and asked me if i had hurt it at all in the past. I remembered a time that i was doing tricep pulldowns at the gym and thought i tweaked it. She had me do chin tucks and the headache sort of receded into my neck. Now i know i was looking in the wrong place. 

Luckily got a quick appointment with an orthopedic specialists, who referred me to PT. I have that coming up after thanksgiving.

Im seriously hoping that this isnt a permanent thing. The chronic pain has driven me insane. Im hoping its just a muscle strain or something that pt can cure, but it has been months and im afraid that if it was one it would be gone by now. It doesnt even hurt that much, its just this annoying, dull pain that doesn’t go away and distracts me from everything. Im young, so i dont know if i could even herniate a cervical disc, but its a possibility. Im so exhausted with dealing with this, i want to move on with my life. Im so afraid of never getting an answer or having a doctor just say “we dont know, good luck.”

 I want to try and get another MRI of my neck because i want to see the problem with my own eyes, but if it came back clear i would be miserable. Thats how bad it is. At least if there was something there, my pain would be validated. The orthopedic specialist said wed do imaging if 8 weeks of PT didnt work, but ive waited so long already. Im so afraid of being stuck like this. I took my normal life for granted, i dont remember what it feels like to not ache in some manner all day everyday, and on top of that, i still dont know what is happening to me. Im scared.

The guy and I would send flirtatious snaps before I began dating my boyfriend, but as soon as I told him I was seeing someone we became completely platonic friends (no romantic feelings). There was a time (before I met my boyfriend) where we had sent explicit pictures. He asked me for those a couple times, and honestly I really regret sending them… not sure why I did. After I began dating they were never sent between us again. 

The guy even thought my boyfriend and I were cute and congratulated me. We would just send each other food, pet pictures or friendly snaps sometimes like the sky to keep the snap streak going, very surface level snaps. 

I have not sent the guy a flirty Snapchat since I’ve been dating, and he hasn’t sent one to me. My boyfriend and I have been dating about a year now and we never discussed boundaries until a few weeks ago when my boyfriend saw a snap from the guy and jokingly said, “are you cheating on me”? I told him it was just an old friend. I was caught off guard by that, and was worried if I had told him I had met the guy on Bumble he would assume the worst like I was cheating or something. I could see he was uncomfortable by me Snap-chatting the guy so I deleted my Snapchat account, and told the guy I would not be using Snapchat anymore. So we just don’t talk anymore.

2022-11-10 08:25:49,Anxiety,"Over the past couple of months ive suddenly been experiencing anxiety related issues. It has gotten so bad that most days I can’t even seem to relax normally anymore. Most days I feel anxious and weak for longer durations and sometimes i get these random rushes of suddenly feeling super lightheaded and feeling like im about to pass out or worse. Also my muscles tend to tense up randomly, especially in my arms, and when i go to bed i sometimes experience these weird vibrations in my chest. Ive also been having attacks of strongly feeling like throwing up while feeling really hot and nauseous, I never throw up though. 

At first I thought i had heart related issues so i went to the doctor. After doing some measurements and tests the doctor concluded it were symptoms of hyperventilation which is mostly caused by anxiety and stress. I generally get stressed out pretty quickly relatively compared to the average person, but ive never experienced this before.

If I got in trouble with my parents I would be sad obviously, but not just plagued with overwhelming anxiety. It’s more being scolded by a teacher, boss, or adult that I’m not super close to. 

I’ve always been very shy and sensitive. Some examples: I remember in third grade I got my color changed in class and I just had this pain in my chest and stomach for days and I barely spoke to my family. One time a neighbor scolded me as a child and the same thing happened. I felt sick to my stomach for days. I had so much anxiety I tried to convince myself the exchange never happened and I dreamed it. I’m a huge rule follower so I’ve never got in trouble often but when I do it kills me. 

Now I’m an adult in a semi professional role and this still happens to me. My job is more relaxed so I don’t mess up often. But there was an incident like 3 years ago at my job where I messed up and got scolded. I ended up crying at work and for days I felt terrible about myself and had overwhelming anxiety.

2022-11-10 08:19:09,Anxiety,"***Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction vs  Escitalopram for the Treatment of Adults With Anxiety Disorders: A  Randomized Clinical Trial (Hoge et al. 2022)***    

New exciting research was recently published in JAMA Psychiatry.

The objective of the study was to determine whether 8 weeks of mindfulness-based stress reduction therapy is non-inferior to escitalopram, which is usually a first-line medical treatment for anxiety disorders.

The study was conducted as a randomized clinical trial.

Hoge and colleagues found that - at the endpoint - the mean CGI-S score (Clinical Global Impression of Severity scale) was reduced both by 1.35 for MSBR, and 1.43 for Escitalopram.

What I really believe is a great catch from this study is that 10 participants dropped out from the escitalopram group due to adverse events, while no drop outs occurred from the MSBR group. This indicates that not only can MSBR therapy compare with the first-line treatment of anxiety disorders, but it can also be a way to do so without any adverse effects from the medicine.

This is really great news for individuals that either (a) are on Escitalopram and might look at other opportunities, or (b) have recently been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and has yet to see the effects of Escitalopram.

2022-11-10 07:42:14,Anxiety,"Today during one of my classes (Psychology) we were presenting slides about different mental illnesses. I was a little nervous about presenting but nothing major, just basic nerves. For some reason the thought of having OCD and/or Tourettes has always made me very anxious and uncomfortable, why I have no idea but I’ve always been that way. The first presentation was about OCD and I started getting anxious for some reason and started feeling nauseous. Then the second presentation happened to be about Tourettes and things got way worse. I was on the verge of puking and I was going to ask to use the bathroom to try to calm my nerves and cause I didn’t want to puke in the middle of class. The presentation wasn’t over yet so I decided I should let my classmate finish instead of interrupting her to ask if I could go. Then my vision started getting blurry and I knew I needed to leave which is where my memory starts getting foggy. I remember telling my friend that I’m leaving then I get up and with every step my vision gets worse and worse until it’s completely just static. I don’t remember this part clearly, it’s more like a thought or a movie scene or something but from what I was told I collapsed backwards and passed out for a few seconds. I then remember continuing to walk to the teacher, asking her if I could use the bathroom, and her telling me to sit down and breath. At this point I felt kind of energetic and confused then I felt really calm. I was also covered in sweat. I remember in the moment being 100% sure it was due to anxiety but now I’m just trying to figure out if that’s true or not


TLDR: Presentations about OCD and Tourette’s made me very anxious and I passed out in the middle of class",Can anxiety cause you to pass/black out?
2022-11-10 07:41:24,Anxiety,"I'm an 18 year old boy who is finishing high school. I'm quite confident that for the last 2 years, beginning right after I returned to school after covid, I've been struggling with quite bad anxiety. I've never been diagnosed or even been to a practitioner. 

I belive school to be the root of my problem. I used to love going but now that can't be further from reality. Things like class speeches and exams would have me stressing and worrying weeks in advance. I'd go into class every day worrying weather or not today is the day we do unprepared speeches or something stupid like that. However now I'm in the final stint of my schooling career. I'm half way through my final exams and I don't think I've been mentally worse off in my entire life. Every morning before I write I feel so horribly anxious to the point where I can't even eat more than 3 bites of my breakfast. It gets even worse when I get to the exam hall. By this time I'm sweating and my stomach feels like it wants to explode. 

I don't remember many days since the end of coivd, probably  5, where I wasn't stressed to go to school and even if I wasn't at school I was stressing at home about going to school. School became a place of anxious memories for me, a place where even if there was nothing to worry about I'd still be anxious because of its status in my mind. 

I feel like this is holding me back. I soon have to look for a job however, however ungrateful this may sound,  I don't want one, it scares me. I don't think I could have one with my current mental state. I would love to get a job I'm passionate for and I know there are such jobs avaliable to me but I just feel I can't do it right now. My anxiety I feel now is not only at school but in my normal life aswell. Sometimes I get so nervous to go stand in a line at a shop and just say thank you to the cashier. I know this might sound corny but everything also feels more dull. I rarely get excited for meaningful things. For example I passed my driver's and I felt like it meant nothing to me or I get a package I order, something that used to feel like Christmas now feels unexciting.

I probally havent even covered half of what makes me anxious.
 But I really wish I didn't have this problem. I really wish I could express my personality to my fullest again. 

Thanks for reading. This is my first post here so this was kinda just a thought dump. Have a good day🙂",First time talking about my anxiety

2022-11-10 07:36:02,Anxiety,I'm from the States originally but have been living in Canada for awhile on various visas and permits. I finally submitted my permanent residency application in September and am having recurrent anxiety attacks thinking about it being rejected. It can take up to 15 months to process. I'm 99.99% sure it will get approved but I can't stop ruminating in fears of it being rejected and my life falling apart.,Anxiety about my immigration paperwork
2022-11-10 07:33:01,Anxiety,"Thankfully, my panic disorder is normally under pretty good control these days. I very rarely feel (abnormally) anxious at all anymore, and when I do I have ways of coping (including pharmaceutical help) that can ease me out of anxiety before I have anything close to a full-blown panic attack. When I DO have an episode of panic, however, I find that the effects of the isolated incident linger with me, and that the extent and duration of this lingering feeling scales proportionally with the intensity and duration of the panic attack. For example, today I had a very scary moment at the doctor's office involving insurance that might have cost me thousands of dollars. I had what I would describe as a minor panic incident - not a full-blown, the Sky is Falling catastrophe but a decent amount of distress that lasted for almost an hour and caused some tears. The triggering event with the insurance was resolved and I calmed down, and the panic itself stopped. But now I feel a familiar, lingering sense of dread and foreboding. I have a theory that it is chemical - that the panic attack itself released a bunch of chemicals into my noggin and now those chemicals are stuck to the receptors and aren't letting go. I've noticed this phenomenon a lot - if I have a small panicky episode this feeling of anxiety and physical discomfort might last a day or two. If I have a MAJOR panic attack, though, then this feeling can go on for weeks. Eventually, feeling anxious and on edge for weeks at a time can lead to symptoms of clinical depression. Does anyone know of any research on this? I feel like what I'm describing is both very generalized (everyone with anxiety feels crappy after having a panic attack), but also very specific (the amount and duration of the anxiety is always directly proportional to the original attack and the symptoms are almost always identical, and aren't relieved by addressing the original cause of the panic attack). Any thoughts, theories, articles or further sources would be most appreciated!","Does Anyone Else Find That Feelings of Unease, Dread and Eventually Depression Can Be Triggered By A Single Panic Attack?"

2022-11-10 07:22:56,Anxiety,"This may be a for a small amount of reassurance but I think it's more advice needed.

So I keep feeling disconnected from everyone else and have a lot of existential and philosophical thoughts. I look at words, faces, objects, people, reactions and situations and just think why and what's it all about and maybe I'm suffering something deeper than anxiety and OCD? If I raise my voice or laugh loudly I think why did I do that? Then cos I'm questioning why about everything I then cause myself more anxiety. Its a vicious cycle and it still makes me think I'm slowly losing it. 

Feeling and thinking this triggers my anxiety and I wish I knew why I was thinking it. I overthink and research everything and just want to be getting on with life like everyone else instead of over evaluating and analysing everything in this life.

2022-11-09 16:36:02,Anxiety,"Okay, to start off I want to say that I'm pretty sure I don't have clinical depression. I wake up and desperately *want* to get out of bed (like my brain is screaming at my body), so I don't believe it's depression. I believe I have semi-severe anxiety, but I don't have the money to get an official diagnosis or help.

I am able to do the bare minimum maintenance tasks. I take care of my pets every day, spend time with my husband, and occasionally clean the house and cook. I am finishing college in chemical engineering while he is working. I sometimes struggle with taking care of myself like brushing my teeth or showering consistently (however I **always** do minimum self-care tasks before leaving the house, it's just if I stay home).

I drink a couple glasses of wine/beer almost every night to relax (as well as drinking to get drunk on occasion), so alcohol is involved, however I have also tried mushrooms and cocaine and never had a desire to take them again, so I don't have a fully addictive personality. As in, alcohol does something for me that other drugs cannot. I also do not let alcohol affect my life beyond the night of drinking, like going to classes drunk or hungover or missing classes, but occasionally I stay up late drinking and might miss classes because I'm almost 30 and need extra sleep that I miss because I'm up late (not necessarily because I'm drinking).

I've been searching for a long time to find exactly how to deal with my problem to no avail. Internet searches always lead to general anxiety, depression, and AAS groups, but these have not helped me so I'm looking for other people with an issue similar to mine, and how you:

1. Stop staying up late
2. Get yourself out of bed (when you have no serious obligation to do so)
3. Be more productive without supervisor intervention
4. This is likely a separate issue, but cut back on drinking

TL;DR My anxiety is messing up parts of my life and I can't find help. I just want to figure out how to go to bed earlier and get myself out of that bed to be more productive.",I have trouble getting out of bed

I had managed it well, until this past June I fell into an anxious spiral of anxiety over a new job. However, I overcame that and by August I was good, and then my brother died suddenly. It was a motorcycle accident, completely unexpected and he was my best friend. Immediately his death I became a power machine, handling paperwork and funeral arrangements and financial arrangements. No anxiety no panic. His funeral came and I attended and comforted everyone. Then it all stopped. And I became an anxious mess again once I had nothing to do. I had a babysitting job tonight. It was supposed to be from 5-10. I decided to take the kids to the park, and while there the younger one started to throw a temper tantrum, which caused me to begin to experience a panic attack.

2022-11-09 13:07:00,Anxiety,"tw: bedbugs 

i was diagnosed with anxiety @ 17. i was put on medication that i don’t believe helped with the anxiety or the panic attacks. i don’t take medicine anymore bc i don’t have insurance or anything.

for the past year or so my anxiety has risen over the top of my other diagnoses and taken control over a lot of my life. recently i will become obsessed with a negative possibility (car issues, and bed bugs most recently; i have neither) and it’s all i can think about when i’m not preoccupied with something. 

i know that my worries are illogical and nonsensical but that doesn’t stop them from taking over. i will go to extraordinary lengths to prevent bad things that i believe could happen when i’m having an anxiety trip. 

i guess what i would like to take away from this are any ways that help you reach a piece of mind. any grounding techniques that help you out. i want this to be manageable until i have access to medication again",anxiety and peace of mind
2022-11-09 12:41:21,Anxiety,"this happened when I was in the 5th grade ik it probably sounds dumb for a kid at that age to have anxiety but idk what else to call what I experienced it was like my mind was split in two one side trying to be rational and saying there's nothing to fear while the other side is going haywire, and my body is reacting to the crazy part. my heart was beating 1000 mph I was sweating, jittery, feeling cold, isolated and afraid, my throat was closing up my eyes felt dry I kept blinking a lot. I'll never forget that feeling. I remember begging the teachers to call my parents and crying the bathroom   


If there's one moment in my past that I can say truly happened it'd be that one. sometimes, I catch myself thinking back to that moment and feeling the same way I did back, then with the anxiety creeping over the shoulder but I'd quickly snap out of it and reassure myself it's all in the past. It felt so real and unreal at the same time.  


to this day I still don't know what got over me I guess I do have an idea of what made me get the anxiety but it's hard to put into words idk honestly but what I do know is that that moment in my life is forever engraved in my head, bless God if I ever forget it.

2022-11-09 12:29:42,Anxiety,"My plushies are my life. As someone who has never had emotionally deep relationships stay in their life (I’m coming up on my 8 month anniversary with my partner and that’s longer than any relationship that has meant anything to me since I was 15), the personalities and cuteness I ascribe to my plushies is the only stable thing. That’s changing though. If you love your plushies as much as I do I recommend you to stop reading.

There are things contributing to the declining comfort from my plushies though.

One time when my partner was visiting, she plucked out the fur of one of my monkey plushies. She also has severe anxiety and was doing it as an anxious habit, but it’s more like how a child would death with their anxiety, not an adult. That moment fucking scarred me. I’m still at college and I don’t live with her yet but how will she react if I say I don’t trust her around my plushies. It hurt harder than any time she has lashed out at me. Any time my ex abused me. Any time someone abandoned me (at least the instant pain of that). When we live together this WILL be trauma.

That’s not the point of this post though. I have these invasive thoughts that are fucking murdering me. I imagine fur getting ripped off my plushies. I imagine eyes falling out. I imagine tears. I can’t even look at my plushies without getting terrified of this. I don’t know how to self actualize here. This isn’t a social anxiety problem where I can rationalize it by predicting how other people will respond. This is a daily hell in my one physical safe space: my bed.

I’ve had this with other physical objects of course, like I’m scared I will suddenly get angry enough to throw my computer or my phone at the wall. None of that hurts as much as damage to my plushies though. I’m terrified.",Help with invasive thoughts about my plushies
2022-11-09 12:20:13,Anxiety,"Hello everyone,

I've been diagnosed with GAD and after trying out a few meds, Pristiq has been working out well for about 6 months.

However for the last few days, during work, I feel my chest and throat feel severely choked but I don't really mentally panic or there's no anxiety as such. 

I guess the meds are helping with the mental symptoms but the physical symptoms are back?

Has anyone dealt with this? 

Thanks much!",Anxiety and Pristiq
2022-11-09 12:14:42,Anxiety,"I go to college and live on campus. I never really had a fear of fire alarms since I was a little kid, but recently started to develop this fear again. This is my second year in college, and didn't even have much of a fear last year, even though the fire alarm in my dorm building went off once or twice. The fear started early this year, when multiple fire alarms would go off in buildings per *day* (campus wide issues), and it included me waking up to a fire alarm and getting an extreme sense of panic, one so great that I forgot to put shoes on and was walking out of the building in socks (this was also on the first day of classes, so I was tired throughout the day due to not being able to fall back asleep). I also had to evacuate for one right after I got out of the shower at night, so I had to get dressed and ready before going out.

This constant multiple fire alarm per-day fiasco slowed down, but there still are a few around campus every week, definitely more than there were last year. I am not really afraid of the implications of the alarm, just the loud noise it produces. I am rational and do understand why the alarm has to be so loud and jarring, but I sometimes have near-sleepless nights worrying about the *what ifs.* I already have pretty bad anxiety, but this is especially bad. The near-sleepless nights also sometimes lead me to sleep in and miss my morning classes, so this is affecting my grades at this point.

The fear is definitely better in the daytime than in the nighttime. I think the fear of hearing the fire alarm while I am decompressing from the day or vulnerable while asleep is where the fear comes from, as most times during the day I do not think about it at all. Another factor of it is that usually during the day I'm with people or know other people are in my dorm, but at night, one of my roommates goes to his girlfriend's and the other two are usually out at one of their friend's, making me feel alone in my room and making my anxiety even worse.

I try to calm myself down by putting AirPods in at night and watching a video or playing some music, but it usually does not help. I am not close enough to commute, but I do go home on the weekends, to see my girlfriend and family (and to get a few nights of good, uninterrupted sleep). 

I'm typing this now because the adjacent building's fire alarm just went off, and I was reminded of this fear. 

I just wanted to try and reach out to see if anyone had some remedies for this borderline paranoia I'm getting because of this fear. 

TLDR; I have a really bad fear of fire alarms going off when I'm asleep and I was wondering if anyone had any advice.",Need Help with Fear of Fire Alarms
2022-11-09 12:07:37,Anxiety,"Im(24M) live in an almost 2 years long distance relationship. This one is the big one i fking love her(22F). Oh wait.. well hear me out. So up until 3 months ago everything was perfect. Then i had my third time i went limp during sex. And it broke me. I instantly started thinking that “our love is fading? Or there is no more attraction now? Why didnt i wanted to have sex that day?” Etc..
Ive been in an overthinking crying spiral for 2+ months now. Im not capable of sex because we can start but my body is screaming anxiety and i just go limp. I know its all in my head.

Like i built a wall around me i destroyed our intimacy regarding nice sex.( we had 2 successful sex since then btw in the 3 months but whats still scaring me that why hasnt that solved my problem then?) This whole thing is exclusively spawned from that night when for the 3rd time in our relationship i went limp. Then tried for the rest of the week every day and i couldnt do it once. It destroyed me mentally. BUT I KNOW that i love her and there is no problem but its like my body is afraid and my anxiety never lets be calm when i think about her (“but do i love her?” And other infuriating questiong from nowhere).

Btw yes we talked about everything im going to therapist(altough i feel like its kinda useless but its the only one available to me) im meditating i quit smoking 3 weeks ago i quit porn 2 days ago. I just want to go back to normal. When i think about her i want the warm and the excitement not the fear and the questions. Its like im obsessively thinking about this stupidity.

2022-11-09 11:52:30,Anxiety,"I have a friend who I’ve been very close with for two years. We have the same hobbies and similar personalities. We also both share similar mental health journeys with anxiety and depression. When she is struggling with these issues she withdraws sometimes. It’s never been longer than 2–3 weeks and she always apologizes. A couple months ago she was in a bad place with anxiety in depression and I heard nothing for a couple months. This was so unlike her and really triggered my anxiety. I also have past trauma with being forgotten or left behind, which made it worse. Sometimes I would reach out once a day once or twice a day. She got back to me a month ago ( after a couple months) and apologized for not keeping in touch. Also that I overwhelmed her with reaching out often.

I had to stop driving because I kept having to pull over every 2 minutes, and I had to put my car in park at red lights because I was shaking so badly and couldn't keep my foot on the brake. I also depersonalize at the wheel, and it seemed very unsafe to drive in that condition.

Anyways, I'm now 26 and still don't drive. It worked out fine for me in the beginning because I was still living with my parents (and we'd go out together as a family very frequently) and was going to online college and working online (freelance writing). But now that I've been living with my fiance, it's been a different setup. He is a homebody and doesn't leave the house much except for work and is often too tired to go out after coming home from work. To top it off, I feel like a kid asking her dad for a ride when I ask him to, say, take me to the store or help me run a basic errand, like picking up my medication from the pharmacy. I feel embarrassed for asking, and I fear he will slowly get sick and tired of this whole setup, even if I pay for gas, thank him, etc.

So, if I have to get something from the store, I will usually just get it DoorDashed or delivered from Amazon. I end up spending more in the end, and I'm okay with that for the convenience; iit's to save myself from embarrassment and to feel as independent as possible given the circumstances.

I feel like my body is shutting down and I have no control over it. My heart pounds constantly and I can’t breathe. I have chest pains, racing thoughts extreme fatigue and dizziness pretty much everyday and I don’t know what to do. Alcohol is pretty much the only thing that helps and i don’t know how else to cope with it. It’s starting to feel like the only solution is ending everything. Anyways sorry for complaining.

Now I feel useless cause I can’t do anything. I was trying to tell me mom that I think I might have agoraphobia. I explained to her what it was and that that’s how I feel. She told me that I shouldn’t be proud of it. I was like how is me saying that’s how I feel mean I’m proud?

2022-11-09 08:37:51,Anxiety,"I'm 45, I've always thought since a teen that I was autistic (or later in life learning the word aspergers) somewhat, not particularly in relation to the title topic but for various reasons, I went to a counselor starting last year, he doesn't think so, he thinks everything I think of as autistic traits are some things from gad. He also never would talk to me much about this title topic, he didn't seem to think it important. Especially now that it's pretty well gone. As a teen when this all started I had somewhat of the looking at the ground social anxiety but I had friends, lots more than my 20s when the social anxiety got way worse through now, still bad.

Anyway, I just broke this habit and now I'm trying to kinda have a post-mortem, why did I do this? I can't find much with google. 

It started when I was 15, I was on a trip with my parents, we were about to go on a riverboat dinner cruise, I remember not really looking forward to it as anything particularly special but I had thoughts of people I knew back home, they'd be impressed as hell about stuff like that. So I started fantasizing about them seeing through my eyes and hearing through my ears.

Somehow this stuck and every time I started to do something remotely cool/impressive/fun I would think about who I'd want to show and I could pick multiple people or just one person, sometimes I'd pick a younger version of myself sending the signal back in time.

Then it started to be mundane stuff like cooking dinner because I was probably cooking way more impressive-like than anyone watching was capable of, they needed to see this shit here, mundane to me maybe, huge huge learning opportunity for them.

Somewhere along the way I developed a censor button that if a screw up happened that I didn't want people to see, that was super easy to cut from the transmission before it got to them,

Somewhere along the way, whatever I was doing like example working on my car, (it's a given at this point I'm transmitting to someone) I would sometimes notice myself doing things more deliberately, like looking close following things with my eye that I didn't even necessarily need to be looking at, could've done it easier and faster by feel but it was as if I was the cameraman with those eyes so there you go.

It was almost all the time going to people I wanted to be around. But sometimes to people I really did not care for, they needed to see how inferior they were or something.

I don't know if delusion is the right word for this, I never ever believed it to be real but I also for 30 years couldn't stop myself from sorta indulging the habit anytime it popped into my mind which was literally dozens of times a day. I did want to stop, I would try to stop myself but it just kept going.

Something strange happened a month or so ago and in relation to that I noticed I hadn't been doing this thing much. Since then it is still popping into my head all the time to start showing someone something but every time I've been able to ""yeah that's not real"" it away.

2022-11-09 08:32:57,Anxiety,"I've been dealing with recurring waves of anxiety attacks for the past three months. Out of nowhere I felt waves of anxiety, nauseous, and couldn't eat anything while going to work. The anxiety attacks were followed by extreme brain fog so I was extremely disoriented and not able to figure out what to do next. I ended up in the ER that night because my legs and hands started shaking profusely, my whole body hunched over. I've been on a sick leave from work to try to deal with the waves of anxiety (maybe 2 days out of the week are good, 5-6 days I'll have constant anxiety) and gone through therapy, which helps on the better days but I don't feel all this talk about ""self acceptance"", ""meditation"" and ""not letting your mind control you"" helps when the pain is so unbearable. I tried Cipralex (seemed fine at first but then I had some wicked anxiety attacks so I stopped) but have still not been able to discover its source.. I think my body is just hypersensitive and triggered by subconscious thoughts? Either way I'm so tired of this, sometimes my brain is so foggy I can barely read anything or form organized thoughts. I rely completely on others in my closest circle since it's hard for me to make simple decisions when I can't think of the right words to describe what I want when my head feels empty and all I feel is either numb or panicky on the bad days.

2022-11-09 08:11:57,Anxiety,"TW mentions of death anxiety
I had really bad death anxiety for a few months that sort of went away on its own. I was so confused as to why it just stopped and when I started seeing a therapist, she explained to me why and how stuff like that happens. Think of it like drawing a line in the sand. The first time the line is drawn, not much sand is moved out of the way. However, the more you go over that line, the deeper the line in the sand gets. That’s what happening in your brain. As you conceptualize something new or develop a new fear, the neurons are firing in a new way, but as you think about it more, your brain gets used to thinking about it. You create a new path in your brain and eventually, it’s a pretty solid path and your brain doesn’t struggle to connect the neurons. The first time it happens will always be the hardest and the scariest because your brain isn’t used to thinking that thought, but it gets easier. Her advice was to lean in to the fear. It’s so scary, but when we lean into it, we’re teaching our brains new things. IT WILL GET EASIER! This fact has helped me understand my brain and my anxiety. I like to remind myself of what’s happening in my mind when i get scared like that. I hope this makes sense and I hope it can help you too &lt;3",A piece of information my therapist gave me that really helps

It's incredibly important to me as getting this certification would open doors to careers outside of where I live right now and I really want out of here. But I haven't taken an exam for the better part of a decade and am anxious as fuck.

On top of that I've been dealing with form anxiety. My biggest concern isn't even the content of the test itself, it's that I'm going to freeze and not even be able to fill out my name properly or filling in the answer bubbles. 

At my current job I have to fill out forms every day and have pretty much turned them into a non-issue for the most part. Sometimes the anxiety comes back and I have to fight it for a minute, but I can still fill them out.

But compounded with the fact I have to fly out of state to another location, stay the night, take the test the next day, then fly home that night... I feel like my nerves will be on fire. It will not be an ideal weekend, but like I said, this test is insanely important to me.

He has been close to her ex-fling's family since they run the church(ex-fling's mom and dad are pastors). Few years ago, (April 2020, to be exact), someone sent a video in a church groupchat. It was ex-fling and his brother saying that she (ex fling) is better than me.(tho they said it in an joking manner but I personally think it's not necessary and is very disrespectful). My boyfriend just laughed about it. And I expected him at least to defend me but he didn't, he kept quiet while the people in the group chat is still shipping them. Tho we've talked about it many times, i still cant get over with it. Now, everytime I see any person going to that specific church, I get triggered and the video will immediately pop up in my mind.

It's like if I choose something interesting i'll have a good paper, but without a good argument. If I choose a serious thing I could make a good argument but end up with a boring shit paper that reads the same as every other paper that will be turned in.

It's worth a large chunk of my grade and I'm already way behind on it compared to everyone else.

2022-11-09 04:57:48,Anxiety,"Well idk what is happening to me but rn I feel so overwhelmed by anxiety because I like someone but I'm afraid to see him. 
We started talking on discord one month ago because we both like jjba and the conversation went well. For the context, we're both in high-school and we're also both 15 years old. 
But since the first day we started to talk I immediately started having feelings for him. I thought he was so soft, caring, cool, nice and all. But. The tomorrow of our cool talk idk why but I started feeling anxious about seeing him at high-school and I don't even know why. At that time I didn't realize my feelings for him yet, I wasn't conscious of that. But idk why, I felt anxious about seeing him. But when I saw him, the anxiety lowered, like a relief. But it kept happening everyday and then I realized I was in love with him. But like I also realized what I was afraid of. It probably sounds stupid or anything but I realized I was afraid of him liking me back and that the reciprocate feelings were about to start a relationship between us. I don't know why but the idea of love scares me so much and I don't even know why. Just the fact of seeing someone you like in a reciprocate way gives me sm anxiety. I don't know why I'm feeling like this and I'm just exhausted because of it. I just want to be normal and being able to be in a relationship with someone without anxiety at all. Well I know he doesn't like me or he doesn't want to be in a relationship but my inner self tells me he might probably change his mind for me, so I feel anxious about it. Then holidays started and we talked A LOT while holidays. And then I finished confessing him the fact I like him. But I got super anxious at the moment so I had to left and calm down about it. Then it went well, and he told me he doesn't want a relationship again yet and the fact he doesn't like anyone. Idk why but it made me sad. I knew that even if that was reciprocate we couldn't be together because my anxiety would be super worse about him but in fact I was sad it wasn't reciprocate. I hate anxiety. It makes me feel things I don't want to feel. It makes me sick and I can't even control it even if I know it's just an anxiety attack. It's the worst feeling.
So now I don't know why I'm always anxious about seeing him and I just want answers to my actual state because I'll go crazy if I don't know why I always have anxiety about that.
Also, I wanted to add that I used to be in a relationship 3 years ago and I felt the exact same way. Just seeing him made me so anxious but then when I saw him I chilled out and got comfortable by the time but the anxiety kept happening for the other days so I broke up with him because I couldn't handle the anxiety.

2022-11-09 04:36:26,Anxiety,"I know this is probably not the subreddit for this kind of thing but I don't know where else I could talk about this so please bear with me. This is kinda long. 

So it all started around 2020 with slight pain in my ribs whenever I applied even a little pressure. It was around my breast area and often times felt like breast pain  and since I have health anxiety, my mind went to the strangest, darkest places. I visited a doctor who dismissed it as ""probably a pulled muscle"" but ever since then, not only has the pain come and gone, my overall health seems to have deteriorated, at least thats how I feel. I'm constantly in pain somewhere or another. My entire body feels painful and tender to touch - my scalp, face, ribs, arms, legs EVERYTHING. My eyes get tired and I constantly keep unfocusing them. Sometimes I end up feeling kind of out of it? Not exactly dizzy but a little disoriented. I keep forgetting things that i literally just may have heard, i keep forgetting simple words in conversations and just feel completely miserable overall. I obsess over all of this and spiral into extreme anxiety attacks mostly at night and can't help imagining scenarios where I end up with a terminal disease. It's honesty terrifying, the tricks your mind can play on you and even though I tell myself that its all just a cruel prank im playing on myself, deep down, I can't help feeling ""what if? what if this happens?"" 

I've been to doctors, mostly gynecologists because I initially thought it was a breast issue. But since I was having a lot of heartburn I also went to a gastroenterologist, he did an endoscopy and told me my stomach lining was inflammed, gave me meds for 14 days and that was it. I feel as if there's more to it, but I'm scared of going to a doctor and telling him all my completely random symptoms and having them tell me that its all in my head. However the longer I don't go to a doctor, the more paranoid and anxious I become. Not to mention the fact that my parents seem to think that i'm just a hypochondriac and that there isn't actually anything wrong with me, so i get no sympathy from them. At this point, I honestly don't know what to do, where to go, what doctor to consult to make this constant hellscape in my mind stop.","Here to vent about my health, both physical and mental because I don't know where else to turn for support and help"

I called my friend to ask if I should go to the hospital, went down stairs and ate and drank and sat on the couch. Took an ECG on my watch to make sure it wasn’t anything with my heart and the feeling went away after about a half an hour.

My anxiety is typically well controlled. Was on medication for a couple years, learned a lot, I'm feeling pretty good these days with one big exception--see title.

My partner is out of town the next 2 weeks for a family issue. I know I'm going to miss them, but that's not the main problem. I just hate being home alone specifically at night (and with the time change it gets dark pretty early in the day where I live). 
As long as I can remember I've been terrified of a home intrusion even though I've never experienced one. Throughout  stressful periods during childhood I would wake up my mom during the night thinking I heard someone outside. This has continued into adulthood and it sucks. 

Having someone home with me, especially my partner who I feel safe with, is the most helpful thing. But right now I'm alone in my house, with my cats thank goodness, and I'm laying in bed paralyzed with fear anytime I hear a noise outside i.e. rain or a squirrel. My partner installed security cameras for me for my peace of mind but I get scared that someone is somehow already inside the house even though I've been home all day. Laundry room is in the basement and I hate it so much, it's so scary going down there and I feel like a scared child.

2022-11-08 15:54:29,Anxiety,"I was on tinder last summer and this May, I unknowingly and unwittingly encountered two scammers who I now know were just phishing for my cc info and not interested in the person I am. They played as ""camgirl's"" just wanting my cc info. The one I almost fell for this May was a type of ""Age verification"" scam when they pretended to be a camgirl too. I almost fell for the one this May when I only entered in my email into their fake dating website. What happened last summer was I only entered in the last remaining amount on a 10$ visa gift card last summer when I fell for the scam last summer. The scammer from last summer used a script with typos, sent me unsolicited nudes and spammed me with their sus link and I unfortunately figured out after I got scammed that they were a scammer. The scammer from this May was harder for me to tell they were a scammer because they played the long con on me and it almost worked, but I never gave them any money though. They also tried to get my cc info, but luckily I gave them no money at all for some sus website.

Either way this was two mistakes I don't ever want to make again. In the age of Onlyfans, I should've known to be more safer online and I was only using tinder to meet people for actual dating, not any of this and none of this needed to happen because I thought I was smarter than this.

Perfect example for me is that I never have anxiety when I drink, the next day you bet your ass I do but any of the symptoms I get from my anxiety I never ever get while I drink.

2022-11-08 15:19:00,Anxiety,"There is research purportedly showing that people who feel lonely and/or suffer from anxiety disorders die younger, while single men die earlier than married men. But is this simply because single men/lonely/anxious people tend to take less care of themselves eg drink more, smoke more, have higher cholesterol from a crap diet etc? (as opposed to the loneliness etc in its own right)         

If a single man is lonely and anxious (and just generally highly strung) BUT is also a healthy weight, low cholesterol, ok blood pressure, worksout, doesn't smoke, doesn't drink, would the fact they're single, alone and anxious still shorten his lifespan?

2022-11-08 15:04:06,Anxiety,"So I have anxiety and depression. A lot of it was from childhood abuse but anxiety exists outside of that reason, started when I was like a preschooler I think? It was a miserable childhood lol.

So, my mental health has affected my job and work history. I cannot stay at a place more than a few weeks to a few months. I end up leaving places because they trigger my anxiety and dread so fucking much. Which turns into anhedonia (lack of finding joy in anything) all the time outside of work bc I'm dreading the workday.

Note that I have worked in fast food places and the occasional factory (both factories I worked at were overnight).

The only thing that I have been able to stick to has been food delivery. I started in October of last year, and has basically been relying on it for money outside of a few stints of trying actual workplaces lol.

I still intend to keep doing food delivery because in a night I can make like around a hundred bucks. And I usually go from like 5-10pm every night. HOWEVER - I am considering a part time job to do during the day before dinner runs. I JUST DONT KNOW IF I SHOULD. I am worried it will be a mistake. I applied to my local Amazon warehouse for flexible scheduling, which is like around 19 hours per week. It's better than the factory and fast food shifts I've worked, bc of it is five days a week, that's like only four hours per day or less. And also, it's a base pay of $16/hr.

But does anyone have any experience in my situation??? I am on meds (Sertraline and hydroxyzine) and go to some therapy. I'm doing better with my anxiety, but due to past experiences I am TERRIFIED I am going to fail at working again!!! Food delivery is my comfort spot, but I would like some extra money that have taxes deducted, plus less wear on my car. I'm still gonna go on food deliveries almost every night, I just want my household to worry less about bills cuz we are two plus months past due for rent and it's been stressing me out 😭

If ANYONE can give me words of encouragement, or advice, or any helpful or relevant tidbits of ANYTHING, please, please tell me! 

Tl;Dr: I hate how my mental health has impeded my life so far and I'm terrified it will do it again if I go back to regular working, even though I am now on meds and therapy.

I feel like because I have much fewer real life interactions with people, I’m much more distrusting of how I’m viewed in friendships, and much more concerned I’m not being a good friend.  In the city, I cared much less what people thought because there were always more people around.  If someone didn’t like me, there were plenty more people to befriend.  Rural towns are too small to not get along with others.

I didn’t seem to have this level of anxiety in the city (teeth chattering, ready to burst into tears, etc) though I often felt stifled by being far from nature and getting out of the city was generally my happy place, so I left.

Now when i say drinking, i was drinking about 20 beers or so minimum, every night since i was about 17 or so, up until 22. I had a day leaving for work in the morning, where i picked up my co worker, and i had some sort of health attack where i had to pull over, i basically fainted, had some severe heart palpitations, and had this feeling of nausea and dizziness in me. Every day since then, i’ve had this feeling, and this scared feeling in my stomach that this is gunna happen again. I went to the hospital a few weeks after cause after i quit drinking cold turkey, i was going through crazy bad withdrawals. Ie, laying on the bathroom floor shaking, constant nausea, faintness, weakness, etc. Its never ending now. Its been over a year and a half now of this, and i went to a consoler, and it just didn’t workout well, especially over the phone. i was prescribed pills &amp; didn’t want to take them due to side effects, i also have never been a fan of medicating. Now, i went a few months without drinking and it was way worse, to this day, i still get it bad, but some days i can push through and others i can’t. When i do drink now socially, after 6 beers i wake up in the morning with weak legs and such bad anxiety… i personally know in my head, i over think &amp; think i’m gunna pass out or have an attack wherever u go thats new or uncomfortable or sometimes even just a place i go regularly. its ruined my friendships, my work, and many many other things i’ve missed out on being a typical 23 year old. any help would be appreciated.

Within a day or two I started feeling a little bit more easily agitated, increased anxiety and obsessive thoughts and the last couple of days I wake up feeling slightly bleak. And I’ve also been waking up very early around 4:30am.  I’m hoping this is just the transition of my brain adjusting to being off the meds.

Long story short I just drove us almost two hours away from my city to the nearest airport to spend the night because he’s catching a flight tomorrow. 

I just told him I left my wallet at my place and he said “ this is how you want to live alone ?”

I’m convinced I left it in my sweater pocket which I took off as we were moving things upstairs to the third floor and it was a work out . So it’s probably locked in my room ( I have keys to my room )

I have been told this is an adaptive defense mechanism. The mind learns to push the thoughts out, but then, since you are not dealing with the emotion, physical symptoms appear. Others have said I am repressing something. Perhaps both answers are really one in the same.

2022-11-08 11:22:30,Anxiety,"Hey guys, 

I've been suffering with anxiety for the past three years. I've always felt like there's *something going on* and its not just simply explained by *anxiety* . Which has led me into years of health anxiety OCD. Thinking I have one health condition after the other that might help explain my anxiety.

Anyways. I popped a KSM-66 Ashwaganda yesterday for the first time ever. After much deliberation and hesitation. I'd read that KSM-66 helps insomniacs (which I am) get to sleep/fix their insomnia. However, I've taken ordinary Ashwaganda Root before, and experienced terrible anxiety attacks/hyper-thyroid type symptoms. So I was very hesitant. 

However, I took it yesterday. (ONLY 150mg) Anxiety proceeded to melt away. And I began to get *really* sleepy. Like, terribly tired. Not like a lethargy tired (that I get due to my *lack* of sleep) but a *sleepy* tired. Like, ""let's just go to bed already"" type of tired. 

I proceeded to sleep the best I've slept in a very long time. My day-after (today) has been great as well. I haven't taken anything today. I guess I attribute my lift to maybe residual KSM66 and a *very* full nights of sleep. 

I've read about anhedonia issues with KSM users. As well as, user side effects like: nausea and constipation (which I got very strongly). 

Anyways, my anxiety and depression have lifted. I feel tremendously better. Much more alive. *What is this? What is happening? Why is this happening? What's the situation that the KSM66 seems to of fixed?* 

Thank you",KSM 66 - What's Happening? Thoughts?

2022-11-08 11:07:26,Anxiety,"So I moved to Florida from a northern state, and I experience depression and anxiety. I thought that it'd help those things but actually in my case it made them worse overall. I'll go into detail on the positives and negatives of living here and how it may affect you.

Positives:
1. Sunshine- it is definitely sunnier here than alot of places, and cus the sun is stronger here than many other places it can help provide adequate vitamin d, if you go out into the sun enough each day
2. Beaches- they're beautiful here, no doubt about it, especially in south Florida. And laying out on a beach will def help raise your vitamin d levels.
3. No state income tax- pretty great stuff, you get what you worked for.
4. Medical marijuana- med weed is a thing here and it's cheaper than many places, so if ur into that, then that's available here
5. Variety of places to live- Jacksonville is different than Orlando, Orlando is different than Naples, Naples is different than miami, if you look there are distinct differences between places

50/50's, positive or negative depending on you:
1. The weather- you either love it or you hate it. If you don't like lightning, you'll hate it here. If you don't like alot of rain, you'll hate it here. If you don't like hot humid weather u'll hate it here. The weather is cooler in the northern parts, hotter in the southern parts. For me personally, I find the weather often times kinda boring, so it's just not my thing.
2. Scenery- some people love the landscape in Florida, some people don't. I'm in the middle. Palm trees are nice, but Florida is *insanely* flat for the most part, so if you like hills, this is not the state for you. 
3. Hurricanes- depending on the category and the location, hurricanes either are a nice experience or a terrible one. On the coast they can be very dangerous, and frankly a huge hassle. If you're in the central areas, they are still quite dangerous but sometimes the sounds of it can be oddly relaxing. Schools close for them too.
4. Traffic- being from a much bigger metro area, the traffic here doesn't really bother me, but if you're from a small town you may find it to be pretty bad 
5. Lack of seasons- for some this may be great, for me I personally can't stand it. I miss the fall, the snow all that. The lack of seasons can make it hard to feel engaged in ur surroundings here. If you like pumpkin patches in fall, sledding and hot cocoa in the winter, u'll have a hard time here.
6. Seasonal depression- yes seasonal depression still affects Floridians. The days get shorter here just like other places in the US and there's less light, so it def is a thing here still.
7. theme parks/tourism- so obv we have Disney and Universal, and those parks are very fun to go to. But one thing to know is that if you move to Orlando, it is tourism season *all the time*. This means that u'll see hotel transport vans on I4, entitled tourists, etc., all the time. And so that can be cool at first, but the issue is it makes it really hard to feel like this place is home. 
8. Natural activities and wildlife- Florida does have some really cool natural things from springs, airboats, and all that. Alligators are def a thing here but they're usually really lazy and don't do much.

Negatives:
1. Cost of living- if you're moving to a coastal area or a major metro, Florida can be quite expensive. For example, an apartment in Orlando, somewhat near Disney, and not even in a good safe area, can be upwards of 2400 bucks a month. 
2. Crime- sadly this is one of the major things that has made my anxiety and depression worse here. Florida is weird in that, in the major metro areas crime tends to mix in everywhere here. Most metro areas around the country have a notable bad area in the city, and then relatively safe suburbs. Florida is usually not like that. Its very common here for the nicest areas, even in the suburbs, to back right up to a really bad area. This means that crime bleeds all around. So in many places in Florida, especially in the Tampa, Miami, and Orlando metros, it can be hard to fully feel safe. And trust me, no amount of tropical scenery and weather will make you feel better if you don't feel safe.
3. Tolls/spread out- in certain metros, Florida has toll roads and those add up fast. Many of Floridas metros are very spread out too meaning it can take quite a long time just to drive to a store that maybe took you 10 min to drive to back home.
4. The people- this one is another thing that really made my depression and anxiety worse. This does not apply to everyone, by any means, but it is more common than not in my experience. From my experience, Floridians tend to not be very friendly, and are surprisingly cliquey, especially in Miami and Orlando. People here just don't really wanna talk to you, or be friends with you, and honestly for me that was super hard cus I like being friendly to people and love to make friends. And if you go down to the Miami metro, many people tend to be just downright mean and aggressive. So it can feel very isolating at times, and again, if that is something you thrive off of, it doesn't matter how tropical it is, you will not be happy. 

If you read through this, and are considering moving here, I'd say to use this to make ur own pros and cons list and see if the good outweights the bad for you, and vice versa. And if anyone thinks of anything else, feel free to comment","If you suffer from anxiety and/or depression and think moving to Florida will help, read this first"

For some context, I've been experiencing anxiety from two-three years now, at first it was pretty severe, I had panic attacks, felt like garbage all the time, and so on... I was in an bad place in general and when I finally had the courage to leave, I started to feel better. Right now I can say i have managed anxiety very well, I try to take care of myself and my thought all I can and I have decent days now! But I always had physichal symptoms and still have them nowadays as I became super aware of my body and how it reacts to things, I feel like anything can make me feel overstimulated now and I'm really accostumed to feel chest tightness, muscle pains, sometimes a bit of vertigo, parestesy and all these physical things. 

Now, I don't go to the beach or the pool often, since I'm living with anxiety I went to the beach at least a few times and I remember the first time I entered in the water and I started to feel the water doing a decent pressure on my chest that I never remember having as a kid, for example... The more deep i was in the water, the more i felt this pressure over my chest, it's like my chest that is most of the time in tension and tight this tension becomes more and more noticeable in the water... It's actually quite uncomfortable and I always wondered if this is part of anxiety. Anxiety has made me feel all sort of strange sensations in my body so I wouldn't be surprised... I try to not overthink about it tho, I can be very hypocondriac and thing that little things that are harmless are a threat to my life.

The psychologist assessed me for a while and came to the conclusion that I had a GAD. But, now that I'm grown up, I realised that I fit the EXACT criteria for Selective Mutism. This habit started when I was about 3 or 4, and even though I don't remember much of my childhood, I'm 98% sure I had to force myself out of it when I was about 12 or 13. My family would always be agitated with me because I refused to talk to the people I'd shut off to, and I think that might have stuffed me up a bit which may have contributed to why I grew out of it. I was a very chatty kid with people I was close to and/or saw often. But I was always known as a shy kid, ESPECIALLY around adults. Which is strange, cause now I'm a teenager and I don't have much issues with talking to adults, rather than the usual bit of shyness of course, I struggle more to speak to new people my age due to excessive shyness, but I do try.

2022-11-08 09:37:57,Anxiety,"I made a mistake and I'm unsure what I should do now.

Today I had an exam with a professor that's a nice person but really disorganized. Because she should have taken this exam already and we're running behind schedule, she decided that once the exam had concluded she would tell us what the correct answers were and we would check to see how much we scored -- the point of this being that we would find out how we did and wouldn't have to wait for her to correct every single exam, but she would still then go over everyone's exam to see if our self-assigned marks were correct.

Well, I did very poorly on this test. Once it was over and she was going through the questions one by one, and we were checking how we did, I realized that everyone around me was correcting their wrong answers to score better. At first I wasn't doing this, but once time started to run out and I saw that I wouldn't pass the exam, I panicked and I tried to correct a couple of questions to reach the passing mark.

I still didn't pass. I'll have to retake the exam. That's okay.

But now I'm going crazy because I realized that, because I was panicking, the corrections I did to my answers makes it very obvious that this was not my initial answer but that I tried very quickly to correct them. I susect that when my professor sees my exam for herself, she will realize that I cheated.

To be honest, I don't feel guilty over having cheated. I'm only scared of what the consequences will be if she finds out.

So I'm unsure what I should do. At first I thought that I should go up to my professor and tell her the truth. I suspect she'll appreciate me being honest and won't seek repercussions, but still -- going up to her and talking about this will make me very anxious.

I’m in a chess club and I enjoy it but I’m not even very good at it and my friends won’t practice with me despite them being much better. I like debating but I get anxiety every time I think about attending the debate club alone. 

I feel as though my life is going too quickly and I’m not doing anything important and I’ll never have any talents. I’m afraid that I’m going to get older and older and suddenly I’ll be 40 with no hobbies or interests beyond spending hours on my Xbox. I don’t want to get married, I don’t want children, I don’t want to be around my family, I just want to be alone somewhere quiet. 
 
Although I know this is what I want, I’m afraid that I’ll turn 70 and I’ll have nothing to show for my life. Im average at everything I’ve done, I have nothing im passionate about other than reading or watching history shows. My friends have been in relationships already and they have things they’re great at. I feel as though im repeating myself but I can’t stop thinking about being old and alone and realising my life was meaningless because I achieved nothing.

Last night I was in the ER for rapid heart rate and dizziness and it turns out (at least in that moment) it was because of dehydration.

I was given fluids to help me rehydrate and literally almost immediately I started feeling chill af. As if I had taken klonopin or something. I literally saw within seconds my heart rate on the monitor go from like very high to in the 90s within seconds. 

I still have horrible health anxiety and they ruled out anything serious with my heart but now i'm like - ok but what if it's my brain - which ik is irrational but that's why we're all in this thread I guess. 

I did ask the nurse as I was leaving if what I was experiencing was ""real"" or if it was psychosomatic so at least if it was the latter, I can bring that to my therapist as something to work on, but she reassured me that I was definitely having a real issue.

2022-11-08 08:28:12,Anxiety,"I’ve never experienced a relationship and the most physical intimacy I’ve had was a hug and I’ve never been on more than one date.

This is long and was mostly for myself, but decided to post it in hopes that I didn’t have to ruminate with this alone, but alas, I probably will

My self esteem is 0. All this time, I thought I wanted a girlfriend and I do eventually, but what I realized is that really, all I want is to have some self esteem.

At first I had some self esteem, I asked some girls out, got rejected, ditched on dates, ghosted, and eventually my self esteem started falling. As time went on, my self esteem has fallen further and further and further until I have nothing left, which is where I am right now. Ever since I was end of middle school. I am now 22 and finishing my masters degree in college.

I just want to finally grow comfortable with a girl. To feel like once I commit to feeling emotions with them, that they will stay. But everytime I start feeling emotions towards them, they leave. It’s like finally relaxing, sitting on a chair, and someone pulling it from beneath you.

If you are optimistic and forgiving, you give that person another chance. After 3 or 4 times, you don’t trust them anymore. But surely it can’t be everybody and it was just 1 bad experience. So you go to the next person and trust that they won’t pull the chair from beneath you once you relax, and then boom, they do it again. So you be optimistic give them a couple more chances, and they keep doing it so you leave them.

You try the next person yet they do the same thing. With each person, you get less and less lenient and give them less tries before you give up. Eventually though you no longer sit in the chair, you hover above it before fully commuting to sitting down. Yet no matter how long you hover over the chair, once you sit and once your back touches the back of the chair, it gets pulled from underneath you.

At some point you never want to sit in a chair again you wait, you’re hesitating, you stop trying to sit on chairs from months, but all you want is to finally sit, so you become “optimistic” again and try again, yet the same thing happens. This is my love life.

At this point I’m like a dog collecting scraps, I just want a small taste from the meal that everyone else is having. While other people have full 4 course meals, I’m collecting scraps that someone feels just so “generous” to give me. A shred of scraps feels to me like a 4 course meal, yet I know it isn’t one.

A like on a dating app, a girl actually texting me back after I give them my number, simply kissing a girl, having sex. All just scraps being thrown to me that will boosts my “self confidence”. But I’ve never gotten into a relationship nor have I experienced anything above be platonic. Really, all these things are are just scraps to lead me on. I never get a relationship so I take what I can get. I want an actual meal, I survive off scraps, and use that smallest bit of energy from those scraps to keep moving on. Yet, I never get to experience an actual meal.

But if I’m starving, how can I genuinely care about anything else? School, work, money, surviving, it’s all pointless if there is nothing to live for. Literally all I want. On the surface, it seems like nothing is wrong, nothing looks too out of place, but for some reason, it really is.

At this point, all my attempts at dating are just me trying to raise my self confidence. Killing a bug won’t make me happy, killing mouse won’t make me happy, but killing a dog will be enough to help me. Killing a lion would help me extremely. I just want to feel the satisfaction that I am capable, able, and that I’m worthy.

I just want someone to value me. Someone to miss me, someone to look for me, someone to get jealous that I’m taking to another girl. Not in a toxic way, just in a way where I feel assured that someone actually cares about me.

At this point however I feel like the water in the pit has almost submerged me and nobody or nothing can drag me out, but myself and the goal I set out to accomplish. I’m between the lines of trying again, or asking you to pass the gun so I can end myself before I have to suffer even more so than I already have.

I’m not weak, I’m strong and I’ve been withholding the weight of the universe for a long time. But it never ends, despite the world crushing me and everything seeming pointless, I dumb school assignments that don’t mean anything, work to make money, and eat to survive. All with no payoff. But I am reaching the end and everything is crushing me. I just want to stop resisting and let it crush me or set the universe aside as I sit outside the world not being a part of it as it continues to move on.","[22m] Everytime I get comfortable and start feeling something with a girl, they leave me"

I decided to change careers because a period of severe depression I slowly began to lose confidence in my ability to do it. I felt incapable of working 1-1 with clients in a therapeutic manner because I had an intense fear of not being able to answer a question or to help in general. I was struggling with my own mental health so I felt like a fraud trying to help others. I'd have severe anxiety at the thought of my CBT sessions. I'd have anxiety attacks before work, or cry uncontrollably because I didn't want to go into work. 

I've been searching for new jobs, but there's nothing I feel able to do, nothing I really want to do. I ended up narrowing it down to data/research jobs or client/account management. It would be an understatment to say I am overwhelmed by the wording in these job descriptions- the feeling is unbearable. I feel like I barely understand a thing- there are all these abbrievations, names of software and my eyes start glazing over, and my focus goes. Usually this ends in tears of frustration and I feel so stupid like I'll never get a job I'll be able to perform well in. 

All of this is not even including the anxiety I feel about having to socialise with colleagues and work in an office again...

2022-11-08 07:46:46,Anxiety,"TW- childhood anxiety

As a kid I was always so afraid of public restrooms. In preschool they would make me so anxious that one day I broke down crying to my parents asking them if I could stop going to pre-school. I remember the reason I was afraid is because there was always older kids in the restroom and for some reason that made me so anxious. My parents ended up letting me stay home the rest of the year.

In kindergarten it didn’t get any easier, and I wet my pants a lot because I was afraid of using the restroom. This happened all the way up to elementary school. I have a very distinct memory of wetting myself in the computer lab in second grade because we were only aloud to use the nearest restroom to the lab, which is the restroom the older kids usually used since it was near their classroom.

I also think this might just be an anxious kid thing, but I would have constant and vivid nightmares almost every night. After one nightmare I’d force myself to stay awake because I knew I’d have another if I went back to sleep

Another weird and strange (and embarrassing) thing I did as a kid was one night in summer camp in 3rd grade, me and the rest of the girls on my team were in the bathrooms getting ready for bed and my camp counselor (an older lady) had a bra on and I grabbbed her breasts. I remember I hadn’t made the concious to choice to do that, I just automatically did it and was weirded out by myself. I didn’t know about the sexual connotations, I still don’t know what came over me, I’m not attracted to women or boobs


I always chalked the bathroom fear up to me being a weird anxious little kid. I’m starting to wonder if there was something more going on that I’m not able to remember.

2022-11-07 15:42:53,Anxiety,"Little context, I'm a 16 y/o girl and I've been diagnosed with social anxiety and (I believe) generalized anxiety for as long as I can remember (litteraly was diagnosed in kindergarten or grade 1 can't remember) however at this stage in life I mostly suffer from severe social anxiety and don't get general anxiety often. I have also been diagnosed with panic disorder since grade 6 which for me presents mainly as frequent anxiety attacks (I assume most people on this sub will know the difference, but for those who don't, anxiety attacks and panic attacks are different  although to my knowledge there is not a different diagnosis for them, essentially anxiety ttcks are typically shorter and triggered by something whereas panic attacks are typically longer and can be random/have no clear trigger.) while out in public as it is my social anxiety that often triggers them.

So with that background out of the way, for a few months now I have been getting that sensation that you get on say a rollercoaster or drop ride where it feels like your stomach drops. I know it's most likely due to my anxiety but i have absolutely no idea why as I've been getting this feeling seemingly randomly. I get it at home, in stores, at school, outside, etc I get it often when I'm feeling no anxiety at all but sometimes (seemingly just by coincidence) I do get it when I feel anxiety. It's usually just one very berief sensation that comes quickly and fades away so it's not my panic disorder and so i really just have no idea why I'm getting this. It happens so frequently (5 or so times a day) that I've decided to look to reddit for answers.

Does anyone else get this, does anyone know what might be causing this sensation?",Why does my stomach constantly get that dropping sensation like I'm on a rollercoaster?

2022-11-07 15:37:33,Anxiety,"(TW if you have health-related anxiety)


I'm 23 years old. Up until I was 18, I never worried about my health. That all changed after I smoked too much weed, woke up the next day to a six hour long panic attack, and gave myself permanent depersonalization. 


Developing depersonalization was my first time experiencing true hopelessness and despair, and I didn't know if I'd ever improve or have my old perception of reality back. It was genuinely traumatizing, and I'm still depersonalized 24/7 to this day. 


Ever since then, I've been worried I'll develop another syndrome, disorder, or disease that will make me feel like I'm ""fucked"". I'm not even talking about stage four cancer or something that's fatal; I'm talking about something that will be chronic, debilitating, life-changing, but not deadly. 


The primary worry I've had over the past five or so years is that I will go blind. However, I always found at least a little respite by telling myself that there's no history of blindness in my family, I don't have visual issues, etc. That all changed earlier this year. 


I was using my desktop computer for the first time in months, and I noticed that a portion of the screen in the upper-right corner looked distorted through the vision in my right eye. I moved my finger to that specific spot, and I noticed that the tip of my finger seemed to disappear. I thought it could've been my glasses causing it, so I took them off, tried it again, yet the distortion and blind spot were both still there. I tested it with my phone, moving it to the same spot, and my phone screen looked like a swirly fun house mirror in that spot of my vision.


I ended up seeing an ophthalmologist a month or so later. My eyes were dilated for the first time, and some tests were ran. Of course, all he found was that my optic nerves both appear swollen, but he didn't think it was pathological due to the fact that both were still symmetrical. I didn't do the visual field test correctly (I was using my central vision), and I think that was a big part of why he didn't refer me to anyone else. 


Ever since this started, I've been in a state of mental distress. I thought I would receive some sort of answer when i saw the ophthalmologist, but of course I didn't. I can't tell if the blind/distorted spot has really gotten worse, but I'm pretty sure it has. I'm pretty sure I'm developing a similar spot in my left eye, so that's just great as well. 


I'm so fucking tired of worrying about this shit. I constantly find myself reminiscing to last year before the spot developed, wishing I could be back in that time when I didn't have this issue. I dread going to another ophthalmologist, having them shine that bright-ass light into my eyes again, and potentially getting some bad news. 


Idk, this is just a vent post. I'm fucking tired of this shit. I feel like I'm going to spend the rest of my life dealing (and worry about) one thing after another.",So Fucking Tired of Worrying About Health Anxiety

2022-11-07 15:29:52,Anxiety,"I abhor choice. If I have even a smidgen of a sadistic streak in me, there could be no other entity I would decimate with as much glee as I would ‘choice’. I would flay it with a jagged blade, leisurely drawing my craggy edge through blood and sinew to separate skin from muscle, exposing the flesh underneath, leaving it out to fester, contaminate and decease. 

My life is clouded with choice. Every move, every decision, every conversation is a choice I push to make. Every reply takes effort. Every silence takes even more. Every action, every inaction, every pull, every push alerts me only of consequence. And I haven’t spent mere hours or weeks doing this, hating this. I’ve spent decades. I’ve spent so long here that this is now my baseline.

So why do I do it? 

Because I want things. From experiences, from situations, from people. I want, therefore, I am. I never had the privilege to learn how not to want. I don’t believe I want it either. What I want is to accept my wants. Wholeheartedly. Wants have been great motivators in my life. They have pushed me to move, to break out of my comfort zones and stay uncomfortable for as long as it takes. They have helped me shape a life that allows me to explore even more wants. (Seriously, the best part about this beast is that it feeds itself.) But wants are… overpowering. If you don’t pay attention, and I mean, attention, your wants could shape you a life you do not actually.. want. So you’ve got to be careful with them. You’ve got to choose when to let your wants take centre-stage, and when to give them up. Ugh, choice again. Somehow, I always seem to make the wrong one.

I’ve often said I’d be a monster if I didn’t have the Mother I do. I can be manipulative. If I have enough energy (I don’t), if I focus on you (you don’t want me to), I would leave no stone unturned. Thankfully, Mother saw this very early on, and taught me the only code of ethic I’m sure I live by today. It’s the only one that stops me: do no harm onto another. Not intentionally, not unintentionally. Not as collateral damage, not by error in judgement, not ever, not at all. No harm is the only way I know how to live. 

But Mother’s version of this rule only applied to everyone else, not to the self. And that’s where it all got twisted up. I will sacrifice myself on any stone and call it an altar, as long as it means that someone is safe.. from me.

On another side, I’m flipping off the lid mad. MAD. At every single person in the world who showed me that my wants are too much. That I’m too intense, that I feel too much. Fuck you and your father. Yes, I do. I feel. I like to feel. Feelings are what make me human. Wants, desires, feelings - all these things that you have dubbed to be too much - these are ME. And fuck you for not being able to understand that. I will not chip a single block of myself off again to accommodate another anymore. 

That’s why I make the choices I do, to hold back, at least for now. I don’t know how to slowly invite someone into my madness. I just open up and show them. And every time I do, they get startled. So I choose to stay in my solitude, scared. Scared that my wants will be disallowed, yet again. 

Seriously.. fuck choice.",Fuck choice

I feel extreme  dread when I realize this and feel like there *must* be some way to continue being conscious after life because the alternative is terrifying.

skin , the doctor said that is normal and is healing great but the problem is that i gave in and googled and i found all sorts off things like :skin cancer , lymphoma that starts with a rash .... and i was fully panicked , and i messaged again my doctor ,told her what i've seen on google and she reassured me that isn't cancer and that i should wait a couple of days till my spot goes away . Now in total is been a week since i had the rash and the spot is still there but it doesn't itch or burn ,is simply a spot .... a spot that don't give me pace , at night i go to bed positive that tomorrow it will go away and in the morning is still there and i'm scared and i don't know what to do anymore..... i'm very scared , in my mind a see flashbacks with those articles and pics on google with skin cancer ... physically i'm very scared to go to the hospital, i have nausea at the thought that i might go to the hospital to investigate that spot ...

2022-11-07 14:48:35,Anxiety,"TW: issues with food

Hi. I (18F) have had depression and anxiety since I was in 6th grade. Only this year did I finally get the courage to see a psychiatrist and get on some medication, since my anxiety attacks and panic attacks were starting to impact my everyday life. I've been on my meds for a few months now, and I feel a lot better. Not having to worry about a sudden panic attack that feels like you're having a heart attack has given me more peace of mind lol. 

But recently, we found out that my mom has breast cancer. This obviously sparked my anxiety back up again, thankfully not as bad as before I was medicated. But now I have this issue that I haven't had before. It feels like lately I've lost all appetite whatsoever for food. I hate eating. I've never been diagnosed with an eating disorder, and I don't think I have one, but this issue is really starting to worry me. I tell my mom how I don't like eating because I don't like the way it makes me feel. I can't describe it. It's not like I feel ""sick,"" per say, it just makes me really physically uncomfortable and feels like a chore. My mom kind of brushes my concerns off a bit, so I don't push it.

For an example of my concerns, I used to love cooking steak with my brother for dinner. It's my favorite, but I don't even wanna eat that anymore. I'm eating less and less now; I only ate a peanut butter and jelly sandwich today and nothing else. I'm wondering if I'm losing any weight. I've always been very skinny and slightly underweight, but I don't know if this anxiety is making it worse. I weigh 108 lbs, which isn't alarming, but idk. I'm scared this is affecting me mentally and physically long-term and I don't know how to reverse it or get help. Or even if I should get help? Maybe my anxiety is just making me blow this up in my head and it's not as serious in reality??? idk

When my psychiatrist asked me if I had any changes in appetite in response to the meds she prescribed, I said I lost appetite. She said that's odd, and probably not due to the medicine, since its side effects are usually increased appetite or no change. I told her about my mom's breast cancer situation, and she said my appetite change is most likely due to the anxiety its causing me, and it should eventually pass. Still, I can't help but feel like I'm damaging my body right now by this new eating habit issue. 

I could use any advice whatsoever, as I feel really stuck right now. Thank you for reading",Help - I'm Worried My Loss of Appetite Due To Anxiety May Be Affecting My Health

2022-11-07 14:13:02,Anxiety,"I've experiences anxiety since the age of 14. Around two years ago, I accepted that I do have anxiety and with this internalization, I began to do address it. Yeah, anxiety sucks ass and it's challenging/tiring to always inform others of not only our current state affectively, but also what they can do to help. So I no longer do because I realized that everyone's human and we can't expect everyone that we encounter to be both conscious of the fact that we \_\_\_\_\_ (couldn't decide wether or not so say ""deal"" ""struggle"" ""have"" or ""tolerate"" so fill in the blank) anxiety and to always move in a way that will not trigger it. It's simply a bad ask. So the solution that I found was, first accepting it and addressing it.

\*If not possible it's still okay, it just may take an extra 10 minutes  
\-Cancel out your environment  
\*Airpods, lo-fi or classical music (I tried the gun range noise canceling earplugs and I do not recommend, hearing your heart beat during and attack is insane)  
\-Meditate for 15 minutes, breath in for 6 and breath out for 6 seconds through your nose.  
{This next step has been a fucking life savor but I only started doing it last week &amp; haven't had an attack yet but after I did this I did not need to do any of the other steps}

2022-11-07 13:13:14,Anxiety,"Here I am high once again. Now I bet your guessing that I’ve been smoking for years to be addicted to weed. Nope. I have only been smoking daily for about a month now. I used to be the most anti-weed person on the planet. I even ended a serious relationship of mine over it years ago. I believed it did nothing for you other than make you a lazy bum. Fast forward a bit and now I use weed daily to cope with my anxiety disorder. I’ve been battling my anxiety for over a year now. I’ve tried the meds, therapy, quit vaping, quit caffeine, and even incorporated healthy habits like meditation/exercise into my daily routine. Still with all of these things I was battling anxiety. Panic attacks weekly if not daily. Constantly living somewhere between depersonalization and derealization. Thought about suicide many times. How life can never be the same for me again because of my anxiety. Some of my goals will never be achieved because of it and I had to learn to accept that. I was an outgoing go-getter to now someone afraid to confront a stranger. A few months ago my current girlfriend recommended trying weed (she used to smoke but doesn’t now). I didn’t want to do weed but was opened to CBD. So I tried full-spectrum CBD for a few months with mostly positive effects but then one day it seemed like it just kinda stopped working. I still have CBD products to use when I can’t smoke but more on that topic in just a bit. So I look into weed for helping with my anxiety since some people do say it works. I can attest weed has fixed a lot of my anxiety. 

I feel alive again. I actually feel like leaving my house for once. The world used to seem like a bad place for so long and now I look at it with a brand new perspective even when I’m sober. Now it seems beautiful with opportunities everywhere. I look forward to going to work again. My relationship is the best it’s been this past year. Friends tell me they see a night and day difference in my personality even while I’m sober. The thing is I learn a lot about myself while high. It gives me the power to see through all the “noise” and find my true self. Learning these things has helped me live a better life while sober. It helps make me see what my anxious thoughts are and what my real thoughts are. I just feel like I have to smoke daily to keep my anxiety down. Now going back to my CBD comment. I believe THC has worked so well for me because it provides symptoms similar to my specific anxiety. The confusion, the off balances, the world not seeming real even. These are things I feel when I have anxiety but my body looks as anxiety as bad, but when I smoke and experience these symptoms it tricks my brain into thinking I’m high and high is a good thing. Weed helps with making you a happier person as well of course. These things really help my anxiety compared to CBD. Because it seems like the CBD can only do so much for me. 

So you are probably wondering why am I worried about being addicted to weed if my life has improved in every aspect? Well I’m worried I’m going to have to be high every minute to be alive. I worry that I’ll wake up one day 5 years from now wondering where the time went. I have goals to achieve and when I’m sober I do pursue these goals, but if I’m high I can only think about them. Now I have made LEAPS of progress towards some task/goals of mine over this past month. I just don’t want to get to a point where I have to be high to live. I also feel like when I’m high I don’t worry enough about some of the important things. I kinda just blow them off to worry about when I’m sober. This is something else I fear will become a bigger issue if I continue to smoke regularly. But if I don’t smoke regularly then I could go back to feeling bland and into hiding. Going back to a person that I’m ashamed I’ve become. 2 days from now I have an appointment to go get my medical marijuana card. I feel like once I get that then I’m signing myself up for quite a long period of time of smoking regularly.

I broke down crying in front of my lead because she kept raising her voice. It didn’t until she saw crying she stopped. I quit that day.

I never told my parents nor my mom because si know they’ll be upset and livid.

Last weekend I(17M) was at an event with my best friend(17M) and some of his other friends. I had been nervous about it for a week coming up to it, and when we got there - I kind of just shut down. 

I could barely talk or do anything because my mind was just fog. he seemed pretty worried about me, and tried asking me what was going on and what I wanted to do. I kind of just said ""I don't know"" and later I turned to meet his eyes and he looked concerned. Every time I tried to speak I felt like I'd burst into tears, so all I said was a quiet ""I'm sorry"" and didn't say anything else for a while. I was on the verge of a panic attack for a long time, and he sat with me through my confusing silence for a bit until we all moved somewhere else. When I was leaving that night, he walked me out alone and I asked to give him a hug. He smiled and nodded and he gave me a big hug. I don't think he'll ever ask about what happened but I feel like I should tell him.

He knew I was nervous about the event beforehand, but I don't think he understood what I meant at all (how could he?). He doesn't know I have this disorder, we've been friends for 5+ years now and I think I owe him an apology and/or explanation at least.

I don't really know how to bring this up or how to explain it. I'm scared he'll just not get it at all.

But I'm anxious as fuck. Sometimes thinking about sitting in that exam room as they pass out the papers is almost enough in it of itself to send me into panic attack mode. 

I don't know what to do. It feels so irrational. The test is timed so my biggest fear is that I'm going to freeze up and have a hard time even filling out my name and answer bubbles which I won't have time to waste on.

It doesn't help my anxiety knowing that I can only take this exam once a year in December and I have to fly to another state to do it. It has become so big in my mind that the thought of it scares me. 

Has anyone been in my shoes and dealt with stuff like this? 

Here's my plan for the weeks leading up to the test:

1) Drop alcohol completely for the next four weeks. I know that it can increase my anxiety which is why I take regular breaks from it. 

2) Possibly get anti-anxiety medication. I have no idea what kind would be good or how I'm even going to find the time to go to the doctor though.

3) Not sure if supplements would be a good choice. Wouldn't be surprised if I have a deficiency somewhere. Wouldn't know where to start with those.

4) I tried CBD for a bit, but honestly, not sure I noticed any sort of difference? I might've noticed a difference with the gummies that help you sleep, but as far as regular CBD I couldn't tell if my anxiety was actually lower or not.

2022-11-07 10:38:30,Anxiety,"I started this treatment 3 days ago and I have 50mg. I just read about some side effects of Zoloft (dumb move) and I had a panick attack. Except I took the drug 6h ago. I could feel all the physical symptoms of a panick attack but I felt good in my head. No crying or anything, I even felt kinda happy.


I hate this. I feel like I'm not in tune with my emotions. But the whole point of anxiety is to have way too much of those emotions so being in tune with them isn't really an option. I know I need help and I thought medecine could help but it is stressing me out. I know I need something, but I also don't want to depend on anything. I've been a smoker and I've almost quit now so I know what it is like to quit something I am dependent to. This is of course not a critique of the drug, if you have it and are happy with it, it's awesome. We are all different and this is just how I feel regarding myself. 


Over the years I've also come to accept my anxiety as a part of me. I don't like it, it has ruined so many things, but it's a part of me. I don't know how to explain it, but thinking about it being totally gone makes me really sad. Writing this paragraph is making me cry, even though I'm supposed to be loaded in serotonin (guess I don't have those scary side effects I've been reading about lol). I've always dissociated my anxiety from myself, it was a measure of defense but doing so made me consider it as a companion. Think of it as a roommate that you don't get along with but are forced to share a room with. It was with me since I was a child and I feel like erasing it with drugs is a treason to me. 


I want to be able to get better through working on myself. I, of course, need some therapist help, but I realized that I need to get through it without meds. It's probably going to be super long, but I'm ready to make this my fight.

2022-11-07 09:49:04,Anxiety,"Throwaway because this is a very unique and specific story. I have clinically diagnosed depression and social anxiety on top of probably some other stuff going on, including other kinds of anxiety. It was a simple job working at a store. The pay was decent, well above minimum wage. I didn't expect to get the job to begin with, so I was excited. I still live with my mom so getting this job was a big step for me towards at least feeling more independent. I was supposed to come in on my first day to handle some training and onboarding type stuff. But for whatever reason, when the time actually came to go to work, I decided that not only did I not want to go, I didn't want the job at all. It was as though I could feel the pressure of having to go to work and perform at my best while also constantly talking to people every day looming over me, and I in the moment wanted no part of it. I now intensely regret this decision, since it took a lot of effort to even find this job (part time entry level jobs are rare where I live) and it would take a while to get one like it, let alone with half decent pay. I feel like I just screwed myself out of my only opportunity to actually become an independent, functional adult because of some random impulsive decision. I had an intense mental breakdown afterwards, possibly my worst ever. I could barely form a sentence. What the fuck is wrong with my brain?","Today I fumbled a job opportunity for no good reason other than ""I don't want to go to work"" and currently feel like absolute shit because of it"
2022-11-07 09:46:42,Anxiety,"I (24F) struggle with anxiety my whole life which can get ugly. I’ve been in and out of therapy for it and have been in traumatic relationships where trust has been broken and my anxiety has gotten worse which contributed to my fear of love. I’ve been avoiding love due to this but life happened and I met a great guy my age who takes good care of me and wants nothing more than to see me well. 

I ended up falling in love and my anxiety and fears grew as I couldn’t accept the reality and vulnerability of being in love with someone again and with a man who treats me way differently compared to what I had. It’s just new to me and I was so scared to get my heart broken that my anxiety and insecurity got the best of me which in turn, broke the man I love. He was committed in dealing with my mental struggles until he got understandably tired by my constant questioning, mood swings and anxiety attacks. 

We recently had a huge argument which changed everything for us and things turned pretty bleak. He broke down and told me that all our fights, my issues and the recent things that happened between us made him tired, is completely overwhelmed and he doesn’t know what to do. He’s also unsure if the love he had for me then is still there. He said he just doesn’t know anything right now and that he needs time soon and that we’ll try to talk again tomorrow and come up with something if there’s any. I woke up feeling optimistic about the future and with the realization to do things right by him and then we had that talk and I’m now completely worried about him and our future. 

I feel horrible that I let my anxiety get to me and ruin something good with my actions. I was not a good partner to him and I told him that I want to make things right again but I wouldn’t force him to stay if he doesn’t want to. For now, I’m just continuing with my therapy sessions, not only for me but for us. I just want 
 things to be ok im the end, I wish I dealt with things differently. I feel awful.",I let my anxiety takeover me and ruin my relationship

2022-11-07 08:32:02,Anxiety,"Hey all

I'm a 34 year old dude in New Jersey with OCD, GAD, Depression, and likely some trauma issues.

I was diagnosed with all of it in 2006 and there really hasn't been a lot of progress as far as managing the disorder goes. While I did manage to untangle some other stuff that was making it all exponentially worse, the OCD still works very much the way it did in the beginning, and its current form is the worst thing I've ever had to deal with in my entire life.

With the disorder being so severe, I can't get a good job, which means I can't get good insurance. In my experience, the best places around here will not accept my insurance (United Healthcare under NJ FamilyCare (Medicaid), aka state insurance), which means I'm forced to see psychs and therapists who are not the best and will usually end up leaving to relocate to a different office/practice, one which doesn't take my insurance. This has happened many, many times.

Further complicating things is the fact that I don't fully understand how my body works. I've been a picky eater since childhood, to the point where while it was frustrating for my parents at the time, it's now frustrating for me as an adult. I often find myself in situations where I genuinely want to try to eat a specific kind of food and am unable to. Food sensitivities, texture, tastes, smells, all sorts of reasons it happens. While this ironically covers unhealthy food, it also covers lots of fruits and veggies as well.

Basically, I feel I've never had a genuinely healthy diet in my life. Still, my bloodwork somehow always looks fine, and none of the many medical professionals I've spoken to have ever sat me down and said, ""you have a disorder because your diet has been atrocious since you were a tiny child.""

I'm honestly starting to think it's a factor.

Not only that, but I do believe I'm overweight for my body type. I'm about 5'5'' or 5'6'' and 211 pounds. While I can see the bones in my hands as I type, I do have a bit of a gut, which can be embarrassing at times.

And to add to all of this, I'm also incredibly lonely. I moved where I live right before the pandemic hit, and ever since I just really haven't been able to figure out how to go about meeting new people and especially dating, since I've never dated before. In a social sense and a romantic sense, it's starting to really get to me.

Last night I realized that getting in shape could potentially start to fix a lot of my major issues, if not outright solve them.

If I can get my body in a healthier state than it's in now, that could possibly put a big dent in the disorder, something I've been striving to do for years now. *Any* alleviation of this disorder would do wonders for me, and I do think that a healthy lifestyle might provide at the very least some relief.

Not only that, but hey, if I look nicer, maybe people will be more likely to take notice of me. So a healthier body could help me in social and romantic terms as well. Maybe.

The thing is, I'm not quite sure where to start.

I actually managed to drop two pounds somehow this past week, before deciding to do all this, and most of what I've been trying to do is portion control and becoming more aware of how much sugar I drink in a day (one of my bigger vices).

I just don't really know what to do next.

**TL;DR** Here's some questions I need to answer in order to continue moving forward with this.

1. What's the best way to start getting active? I can try to do daily walks, dunno how long/how many steps is optimal. Don't even know what I should concentrate on more between how long I'm walking and how many steps I get. But I also don't always feel up to leaving the house, so I'm wondering if there's some cardio I could do in my tiny, thin-walled apartment, that wouldn't involve jumping or making too much noise.

2. I want to try to get as much spinach and kale in my diet as possible. I have an occasional shake from California Shakes at a nearby mall (the Tune-Up, I believe), and my mom likes trying to make her own version of at-home shakes that incorporate those as well. But I swear I had a bottled shake from 7-11 or something similar once that had those ingredients as well. Is that good too? Is there an easier way to get those in my system daily? Shake-making seems a little daunting... I'll learn if I have to though...

3. I've never in my life received a straight answer to this question. It always varies. But when hydrating, is it ok to gulp down water, or *must* it be sipped throughout the day? For a while I'd gulp down a glass of water immediately upon waking up in the morning, but now I don't know if that's good or bad.

4. Does anyone else have any tips for getting started with something like this? I don't think I'm ready to sign up for a gym or try to find a personal trainer yet but I wouldn't be opposed to that, if I could afford it.

Eventually I stopped, I'm not sure when but i eventually stopped. The depression &amp; anxiety stopped. Even as a child (5-7) years old I had bad anxiety. ""What if we crash and die?"" ""What if I stop breathing"" it consumed me as a kid. I would cry all night, my father had to sleep on the floor for years &amp; everytime he'd try to sneak back into his own bed I'd somehow sense it &amp; wake up. Never told anyone how I was feeling then. Eventually it passed. Since getting pregnant my anxiety started up again... I moved away from home &amp; moved in with my babydaddy (my now husband) the first night I cried my eyes out. I felt like I disappointed my parents by getting pregnant &amp; leaving college ( I was a game design major). That first night was the start of a downward spiral for my mental health. Being pregnant &amp; having a baby inside you is beautiful but also traumatic. The dreams I had were horrendous. I had a fear of leaving the apartment in fear of something happening to me &amp; my dying. Especially since I was having a boy, I always wanted a son. I was terrified of losing him. The thought of it made me cry all night. I'd push myself to go out &amp; I'd smile &amp; I did have a good time but the ride there full of ANXIETY  the ride back ANXIETY. When I'm at my destination I'm on high alert ⚠️  I'm scared someone is going to stab my belly or harm my baby. I don't care about me at this point just my baby. Fast forward 9 months later. I have my baby 7.7oz 8:09Am a beautiful baby boy that looks like a porcelain doll because of his fair skin despite being full Mexican lol. My anxiety is through the roof the first week. He was a month early due to the rate at which he was gaining weight. Because he was early his liver wasnt able to fully develop yet (its usually the last to develop) This caused him to have a bilirubin score of 19. As some may know a score of 20 causes brain damage. My baby was so yellow he looked orange. The night I finally got to take him home I cried. I was so scared that he would die of SIDS I was scared his jaundice would come back. I'd cry and stay up all night watching over my little baby. I miss the days where I could do things and not worry about anything. Now I have people who need me. Like my son &amp;, my amazing husband. I'm scared of leaving them behind. I'm scared of not being able to build a future with them. I'm scared one of them might get taken from me. I'm scared that if I do lose one I might never recover. I'm scared if I leave this earth they'll move on without me and start a life with a new ""mom""/""wife"" I'm scared ill never see them again. I'm scared of parking lots, I'm scared of cars, I'm scared of grocery stores, I'm scared of malls, I'm scared of general stores, I'm scared of food (I have food anxiety due to my IBS) I'm scared of going to the Dr and finding out my health isn't good ( I work out 3-4 times a week btw) I'm scared of water, ocean, Rivera, lakes, deep water. I'm scared of bugs, germs, residue, dirty hands. I'm scared of taking to people. I find myself cold , sweaty &amp; shaking when I talk to people new or people that I don't talk to alot. I'm scared of sickness more specifically getting my son sick. Yesterday I decided to quit smoking 🍃 I started up again 3 months after having my son (can't smoke &amp; breastfeed) everything was fine... untill yesterday. It felt like I was dying. My chest was heavy &amp; it hurt. I could hear my heart beating &amp; palpatating . This has been happening for a month now but never like this. I cried of for freedom from smoking and  i guess in a way i got that but i didnt expect my anxiety to take it from me. I guess God works in ways we never think of.

2022-11-06 15:37:11,Anxiety,"Backstory.. I started having anxiety at 18, never too awful just minor symptoms here and there and it wasn’t until about 20 when things took a turn for the worst. I dropped out of college where I was playing college football which had been a dream of mine since i was a kid. And I was home bound for about a year and a half until one day I decided I was gonna face my fears and start exercising again. Slowly things began to get a lot better I started to become comfortable doing things I never would’ve dreamt of doing before (going to concerts, hanging out with friends, driving, etc). During this time period I didn’t have a job, i’ve been lucky enough to have a very supportive grandmother who gives me a roof over my head and takes care of my basic needs. But now that i’m 22 almost 23 I knew I had to get my life together and find a job and start making some sort of income. I thought I was in a good place mentally and was pretty confident that I’d be okay in doing so. After looking for a job months and having ultimately 0 look due to the huge gap in my resume, the police chief of my city asked me if i’d ever thought about becoming a cop. The answer was no. Fast forward a few months… still jobless, my dad says to me “maybe you should take that police job, I think you’ll love it blah blah blah.” Pressuring me into doing so until finally I gave in and have currently been here for 4 months. The first few weeks were great. I told myself that I might actually love this job. I became good friends with my coworkers, and everything was going much better then i could have ever imagined. Until one day I had my first anxiety attack at work. I didn’t show it, and just road it out. But i thought to myself “Uh oh, that was weird. That hasn’t happened in a while”. And since then it’s been completely downhill. I’m having multiple a day, whether i’m at work or at home. My mental health is at it’s complete worst and showing no signs of getting better anytime soon. I don’t know what to do. I’ll let a ton of people down if i quit.. friends, coworkers, family, all the people that love that i’m a cop in our small community. If it weren’t for my anxiety i could definitely see myself making a career out this but is also the absolute worst job to have GAD in. I’m lost, Im sad, i don’t know what to do.",Anxiety At Work.

I've been kind of down in the dumps to the point of feeling stagnant despite how things are going with my life. I like my job; I'm taking care of myself; maintaining a good social life with friends and family. I did recently broke up with my bofyriend because of long distane and jealousy, and I feel like I should prioritize myself. So If I'm wanting to priortize myself, I don't know what that would be.

I've been going out, drinking, and doing recreational drugs almost every weekend. And I'm to the point of ""yeah, I got to slow down on this."" Every time I come home from work, I go straight to my room, smoke weed, and watch TV (I also got used to this due to being in a long distance relationship I would go straight to video chat with him).

Maybe I don't have a hobby? It's not that I don't have interests, I'm just... lazy. I used to work out..... yeah. I went ice skating for a while, stopped cause of time conflict.

I have REOCD and I guess that makes this harder to process and I get stuck in loops but what I did was still really bad and I’m having a really hard time processing it. I had trauma and endured emotional abuse from about 8 years old and wonder if that could have contributed. My parents also never talked about sex or consent and I was exposed to porn at a young age. I have so much shame and guilt from something I did when I was 15 and babysitting a family friends toddler. I have no idea why, apart from the fact I was immature stupid and curious and not experienced at that age. I briefly touched him in an inappropriately and exposed myself to him while I was sitting on the couch. I don’t remember clearly but I may have said to him that he could touch me. He didn’t, and I didn’t force him to do anything and wasn’t looking for sexual gratification from him, I was just curious and dumb I guess. I am mortified by what I did and feel awful. I feel like such a sick human being and like wtf was wrong with me back then not to realise how messed up that was. I think I thought it was just experimenting and didn’t realise the gravity of what I was doing. I feel like I should have been old enough to know that though. I’m just at a loss. I’ve told my husband and my parents everything. They have been very supportive and acknowledged that it was obviously a mistake and a poor choice to make, but no harm was caused (the boy doesn’t remember), and that it was out of curiosity and poor judgement at the time. I just feel so ashamed and sick. I’ve never been attracted to kids and I’ve never done and never would do anything like that again. I was just curious and didn’t realise the harm I could cause or the impact it could have on him or me later in life. I love kids and I would love to be a mother one day but I just feel like I couldn’t possibly because I wouldn’t want my child to have a mother like me. I feel like I don’t deserve any of the love of my friends or family and that they would all hate me if they knew what I did as a teen. How do I move on from this? Do I even deserve to? I feel like the only person in the world who has done something like this and grown up to be just a regular person.

Quick question?!

I've been on the verge of thinking I have low IQ. BUT, I have my CNA and passed that.. some people don't. Anyways, my therapist said I'm average intelligence and she doesn't think I have an intellectual disability, but I did miss a lot of school in my learning years. So I was placed in special education, I had normal classes for all of them just some had a paraprofessional. They put me in cause i fell behind due to missing a lot. I do have ADD, got diagnosed in middle school. I have this thought that staggers around my head that I'm intellectual disabled or impaired. Everyone around me says I'm fine, but I keep obsessing over it. I took a few Mensa tests and the first time I took Norway I got 88 then I took Denmark and got 102. Like I said my therapist said in order to pass my CNA I'd need to have average intelligence. Is she right? 
The ladies at work always say I do a great job and got employee of the month after two months being here. I've been a CNA 5+ years and I felt like after that I started to mess up I switched to the hospital. Do you think the nurses think I'm dumb? Idk I'm so worried. 
This is strange I know, but I was considering moving to Texas and I thought of the list of things I needed to do. Like look into insurance, jobs, wondering about my taxes. Am I normal? Or am I just low IQ? I KNOW I shouldn't be asking on here. 
Wouldn't they found it before turning 25!?

Idk, I feel like I'm treated differently.. but maybe it's my head telling me different. Is this just anxiety?",anxiety or actual issues?

Would I have been able to pass my CNA if I was borderline intellectually disabled? My therapist says I wouldn't have been able to if I was. She said I'd have to have average intelligence. Is she correct?.

I was going a little too crazy for a while with my e-mail feeling like every time one came in I needed to do something about it asap or it would bother me seeing them build up every time one came in on my phone so I changed mine to only fetch emails once an hour or when I’m actively in my inbox and that had a dramatically reduced effect on my anxiety about them so it doesn’t nearly bother me like it used to.

I just successfully went through some unread emails and deleted old read ones just sitting there and dramatically reduced the inbox down again and now I only have 42 unread emails which are 95% related to my health insurance through work so I just have to find the time/spoons to go through them at some point and deal with the probably mostly expired notifications by now but I’m so happy that’s all that’s left and it’s a huge weight off of my shoulders.

Too much to explain but i’ve been having violent thoughts and fantasies.

i’m alone in my room 24/7 and don’t receive any contact with other people other than my family.

all i watch on youtube is videos detailing gore or extreme content (nothing illegal) and i spend hours on end watching and reading about gore.

i of course would never hurt anyone and these are only thoughts in my head but it’s getting worse. i can control it.

i’m not a psychopath and don’t enjoy hurting other people, i would never hurt anyone or an animal.

I know this isn't the intent, she texted about how some characters were not how she had envisioned them to be and how they aren't as ""big and cool"" as she initially thought they were.

I'm just stressing over this, and I feel guilty for even fixating on it. I'm just waiting for this lingering feeling to go away so I can work on my projects without thinking this.

I've had migraines as far back as i can remember, and when i was discharged from the hospital for mental health issues, i had to see an inhouse physician. I mentioned my migraines and how they can also be problematic in life and was prescribed Topiramate which is an anticonvulsant used to prevent migraines. Unfortunately it has terrible interactions with a lot of the other medicines i've been put on, it made me stay awake a very long time a couple times and i've stopped using it since, but i feel like i need something for them still.

2022-11-06 10:53:05,Anxiety,"!!!TW: mentions of car accident !!!

My parents just came home and my mom was in tears. I come to find they had witnessed a fatal car crash and my mom had tried to help but was too late and saw the aftermath. 

My anxiety was instantly triggered the second they explained what happened  and I wasn’t even the person to see the damn thing. They almost started describing the scene and I froze and freaked. I begged them not to describe it to me, even the thought of witnessing something so traumatic brought me to tears. I was already anxious about something else, and this made me spiral.

Now I’m getting scolded because I’m supposed to be supporting my poor mother who DID witness it but now all I can think about is how horribly those people must have died and how quickly it could happen to me and anyone I know. Now I don’t even want to get in my car tomorrow.

2022-11-06 10:48:01,Anxiety,"I'm a 5'6 male who's also obese.

Although I'm trying to lose weight around people i feel inferior. Especially around girls, because no girl really comes up to talk to me and those who do ghost me. Among men, i have had a few friends in the past in highschool but ever since i entered college I've got no friends, and my family is thousands of miles away from me. It's a little decent now but the first month I woke up to crying and slept crying and had a panic attack once out of loneliness. I just want people to talk to me normally. Whenever I go people look at me differently, if i make a joke at someone they just fat shame me and the whole class laughs, I literally fear even talking to someone.
No matter how valid and useful the point made by me is, a far joke destroys it all. I've started hitting the gym and trying to fix my diet but with college and another professional course on the side my schedule is effed up. But still I'm trying my best so people accept me.

Secondly, i think i am motivated, i have so much work to do but i procrastinate all the time. I'm in a college where only students with good grades get in. This year due to covid they had an entrance exam and i passed and the students I'm around have way more highschool grades than me and are more involved in the class, they answer every question and i sit around the class knowing nothing. Everyday my motivation is destroyed after analysing my competition, i always underestimate myself and think I'm inferior to everyone.

I'm also not tall or fit as i mentioned and around other men i feel very low. They're tall and fit and also good at studies like they're the perfect people and here i am doing nothing just a random guy who no one wants to talk to. I've been cut out of the conversation many times making me more and more introverted every time. I love basketball and boxing but can't do it because college doesn't have that facility, but when i look at their fitness and height i feel insecure and dead inside.

This has happened before where my right arm would just freeze during an attack and I would try to get it moving with my left hand, which doesn't get affected by the attacks. But this time it was the whole right side of my body.
  Voices in my head kept telling me different things, one said that it was just another panic attack and that I should go through the steps I've learned to counteract this. The other voice was louder and more frantic it told me that the phone I had in my hand was dangerous and that I had to get rid of it (I assume the recent attacks sort of mold themselves out of what is currently around me, the bottle and now the phone) I don't know why but I kept fighting myself both physically and mentally one said said it was all in my head and the other said ""no you're in danger"" then I threw my phone across the table but I caught it with the other hand, the one on the side that was trying to calm me down.
   Then as the attack was ending I felt my whole body freeze and then... I pissed myself.

2022-11-06 10:10:59,Anxiety,"Hey everyone, 

This is my first ever post so I’m going to post this on a few forums so any help or advice would be appreciated.

Back in March I got prescribed citalopram (10MG) for anxiety. I’ve suffered with anxiety my entire life but it got worse in January where I was so paranoid I had to cover my mirrors in my room and couldn’t even look at my pop figures without thinking they were moving, I also couldn’t slepe on my own (still can’t) since then I’ve been a little better but I find it incredibly difficult to sleep in someone else’s home to the point I’ve been having panic attacks.

I’ve stayed in my partners parents house every other weekend (she still lived with them at this point) so I’m quite comfortable and familiar with it. But we moved into our own shared house in July and first few weeks we stayed in my partners room (we’ve separated rooms just for decor purposes but we sleep in the same bed), as I wasn’t familiar with our new house and felt uneasy in my room. That changed and we stay in my room all the time. I’ve just written that to give an example of how uncomfortable I can be.

So fast forward till today and we decided to stay in her parents house tonight but I had a panic attack in bed and felt like this huge feeling of unease and overwhelmed. This happened when I started going to sleep, when I closed my eyes all I’ve saw is scary images in my head and I try to think of something else but those images don’t disappear. I don’t know why this is happening. I’ve had sleep paralysis once in her house but I was facing her wall so I didn’t see anything just heard but that was over a year ago and I’ve slept here loads since. I’m just not sure what’s happening.

I’m considering ringing my doctor and explaining this to them, I wish I wasn’t like this because I know it scares my partner. I can’t even go downstairs at night to get a drink of water, I hate being home alone and if I am I never leave my room.

I just feel so fucked up. Also, a few months ago we stayed at our friends for a concert and we ended up leaving half way through the night because I was so uneasy and alert when staying there. I’m fine staying at my own parents house cause I grew up there etc. I’ve also had problems in a student house 3 years ago were I was literally terrified of the house and just felt so on edge there.

Does anyone have any suggestions or advice. I’ve tried thinking of different things when I go to bed but it never works.

I just cut for the first time in 3 years because Ive been sleeping g 0.5-4 hours every night for the past 4 months whilst working 12 hours 4 days a week at my new job I know little about in a new country.. I swore I’d never do it again and I’ve worked so, so fucking hard to avoid the temptation the last few months and stay positive despite the sleep anxiety being so, so dire. I’ve been exercising, improving my diet, reaching out to family and making friends to prevent the suicidal ideation coming back. my anxiety is so severe I want to die for relief, even though I’m not actually depressed. I’m constantly pumped full of adrenaline, every day and night since January of this year. It never goes away. So tonight I snapped, because I just moved into a new apartment yesterday and my neighbours are super loud and slam the doors in the morning and I realised with dread that my sleep anxiety is about to get even more worse- I don’t know how I can cope with this any longer. I’m barely functioning at work. If they fire me, I’m fucked, I have no money or good skills for my resume to get another job. I’m terrified. I’m 24 and now have fresh cuts for the first time in ages.

2022-11-06 09:32:03,Anxiety,"(Apology for spelling and grammar. I’m just writing my thoughts and am probably not doing that great at it.)


I hate hate hate hate hate showering and all that goes with. I shower about once a week, and only then, because my parents force me to. I know this is bad and gross but I just can never make myself shower it’s so difficult. It’s worrying my parents so that my mum has asked if anything has happened to me in a shower before (I think she means on the lines of assault) which no nothing has. She’s also been asking me if it’s an anxious thing or just being lazy. I think it’s both but mostly the latter. I used to cut a lot in the shower so I think that’s got a tiny bit to do with it, but I genuinely feel mostly that I’m just not bothered to go through all the effort it takes. 

Only washing myself once a week includes only washing my hair once a week, and my hair is not the type that only needs a once a week washing. My greasy hair is probably the most notable thing that anyone sees and my mum always comments on it. I genuinely don’t believe I smell as no one has mentioned it (and my family and friends both are the type that would - not in a mean way) but I still get rlly worried about it. The one hygienic thing I do do on a daily basis is wearing deodorant, because it’s easy, so I think this helps. Hopefully. 

Also it’s more the getting in to the shower that is the hard bit. When I’m in I just zone out entirely and stay in for an hour. Then air dry with a towel wrapped around me lying on the floor for another hour usually. But this does not mean I enjoy any of the experience. 

I prefer baths but I tend to shower as I have to wash my hair so that solution just isn’t practical. 

I hardly ever brush my teeth mostly because I forget. Every school day I remember to in the mornings as it is part of my routine, but nights, weekends and holidays are really bad. I only remember if I someone mentions going to brush their teeth or if they ask if I have done mine yet.  This is probably one of the worst ones as dental care supposedly sucks but I have been lucky enough to never have had to do anything for my teeth. 

I also struggle to change clothes. Unless I go out, and even sometimes when I do, I only change clothes once a week or even once a fortnight. This is awful and I do start to spell at the end of it, but as I’m just at home I don’t care. The worst thing out of everything however, is I also tend to not change underwear every day as well. Really bad I know. Usually I change them more frequently than my clothes, at least twice a week, but still bad. 

As a girl, the norms of shaving armpits and legs I’ve completely given up on as that would just be another task to add to for my showers that are already hard enough (along with the fact that I have to retrieve and return the razor.)

It’s also bad when I’m on my period, I’m currently on the pill so I usually skip it but when I don’t, like it’s really bad. If anything it’s possibly worse when I’m on my period because I hate dealing with it so I don’t even change my pads more than once a day. I hate how I do that the most, as it’s literally old gross blood in your underwear. 

As the non conventional sufferer of poor hygiene (a thin teenage girl) I feel really ashamed, but I still can’t bring myself to do these things. It’s quite embarrassing and I can’t talk to anyone about it. 

I have adhd and depression along with my anxiety, and supposedly some people with those experience a similar thing, so they are potentially a reason.

2022-11-06 09:26:01,Anxiety,"Hi! 

I have struggled with anxiety for years and honestly it feels like with each passing day, my anxiety becomes worse and worse. I wish I could just stop being anxious, but I've tried coping mechanisms, but the voices in my head can never be shut up. Anxiety consumes my life and ruins my relationships. Its gotten really bad the past few weeks. 

When I was younger - I didn't realize at the time - I used alcohol to cope with uncomfortable feelings. Alcohol helped me feel carefree and actually enjoy the moment. I did not fear what others perceptions of me were in that moment nor fear anything at all. Now, I am sober and no longer drink, but I do find myself tempted to drown out my sorrows with the bittersweet tasting liquid. 

Sometimes it is so hard to function because the only break I get from my anxious thoughts is when I am asleep. I would love to sleep all day, but as an adult I have tasks I need to do to ensure that I have access to all these basic necessities.

I talked to my therapist and we discussed that maybe a better career for me is something more steady, but I'm supposed to graduate in a year and I'm not sure I'll be able to change majors without taking on more loans that I can't hope to pay off. 

Even if I do manage to switch, I still have like two months of this internship and it's already caused me to have daily panic attacks. But I can't just quit because I need the job experience, I've already quit 2 jobs before this, and all my friends and family would be so disappointed in me. And I would be disappointed in myself.

I hate this so much I want to just feel normal",This internship is killing me

2022-11-06 08:29:42,Anxiety,"So my brother lives about 3 hours away and decided to spend the weekend with me for his birthday. Today is his last day here and I set up a small birthday get together with my grandparents and cousin to cut him a cake. Halfway through, I started to have anxiety and by the time we cut the cake, I was about to have a panic attack so I excused myself to my grandparents room. While I was away, everyone left excluding my brother and grandma- who was halfway asleep on the couch watching tv. After my panic attack, I came out the room and told my brother I wasn’t feeling well and wanted to go home. He got upset at me and angrily told me he wanted to finish his show (had another half hour left) but I refused stating I really needed to get home and he could watch it there. He was upset the whole car ride home and yelled at me for “being selfish”- even though he has never shown any concern over my own mental health struggles. I have had panic attacks in front of him and he only told me to “get over it” and “it’s not that serious”. I’m just tired and don’t feel like justifying my anxiety to someone who doesn’t even care.

2022-11-06 08:22:36,Anxiety,"My anxiety is related to getting exhausted but then unable to sleep. I feel terrible, and start really worrying about getting enough sleep. I know if I don’t get enough sleep I’ll feel worse physically and psychologically, yet my anxiety then keeps me up. It’s a vicious cycle. In the past, I did fairly well with Xanax or a low dose of quetiapine. However, my current psychiatrist doesn’t believe in giving medication for anxiety episodes. He keeps telling me that I should get “(coping) skills not pills”. I really don’t have much of the Xanax left, so I really try to avoid using it.

Anyway, this last week has been very stressful. Because of the high cost of living in the area I just moved to, I’ve had to work two jobs. This last week, I worked three twelve hour days (not including commute) back to back. Some people might be able to do it and sleep it off, but it’s really given me a lot of stress which has fueled my insomnia and sleep anxiety.

2022-11-06 07:45:07,Anxiety,"I have a few different anxiety triggers that I know of; heights (maybe flying), driving, and elevators. There are some others but these are the main. My heart will start racing, hyper-salivation will occur, I have a hard to swallowing, and sometimes a hard time breathing. I wouldn't classify it as having a panic attack, but it does affect me quite a bit. Most of these anxieties occur when I'm alone. I don't exactly know why I have these fears. I didn't really have anything ""traumatic"" happen but I do have some theories as to why I do. 

I never used to have driving anxiety until I stopped driving when I was attending college. I didn't have a car with me and got around via public transit and walking (I was in a large city). Now whenever I'm behind the wheel, the anxiety hits. It used to be only on the freeway so I would avoid them at all costs. But recently it's been starting to occur just driving on the road, especially if I'm waiting at a light. I assume I have anxiety now because the drivers have gotten significantly worse since I was in high school and wasn't able to adjust. Sitting at a stop light though, I have no idea. Maybe it's the fear of getting hit? I am mostly fine driving if I have one other person in the car with me, but alone is when it gets bad. I try my best to not think and just drive and focus on the music. It doesn't always work. 

I never realized I had a fear of heights until I went on a vacation that required flying. I hadn't been on a plane since I was four so it had been about eight years. I had gone with my mom and aunt. I remember my aunt told me to look out the plane window because we were flying over the town I lived in and I suddenly started to get nervous and hyper-salivation occurred. I remember I also couldn't eat or drink anything on the plane because the anxiety caused me to have a hard time swallowing. I don't have a fear of heights if I'm physically on land. It's only in tall buildings and planes. I personally think this fear was caused by 9/11. I was four when it happened, so I think it traumatized me. I think it also is the cause of my fear of elevators. Getting trapped and not being able to get out mostly. The anxiety only occurs if I'm riding on it alone, but if I'm with one other person, I'm perfectly fine. I've been working really hard to overcome this fear because my job requires me to use one, and I think it's slowly improving. I tend to have a video or music playing and just focus one that and my breathing; maybe have my eyes shut until the doors open. 

My driving anxiety is the one I really want to overcome. I don't currently live in a city anymore, so you really need a car to be able to get around. The anxiety limits where I can go and what I can do. I'm unable to go far because my anxiety is bad. I am fairly independent and I hate having to rely on others to get around or do something with. So I'm just wondering, what do you do to cope with anxiety?",How do you cope with anxiety?

I was not the only person affected by this person; at least 20 people were, including one of my closest friends, who was subject to a horrendous lie by this person. They ended MULTIPLE friendships with their manipulation. This all came to a head when two of us were unfairly removed from a moderation team right before my birthday last December because of this person.

Yesterday at school I was having a pretty normal day, until I had to give a presentation in one of my classes. I gave it and I was very embarrassed, I felt I did a bad job, and I just got overwhelmed. I was sitting with a group of people and I started getting this weird feeling like my heart was skipping beats or squeezing weirdly. I also started feeling like I could not get in enough air, I was trying to take deep breaths and I couldn’t breathe. My vision started to blur around the edges, I felt like the room was tilting, I got lightheaded, and I was shaking too. I could tell this was some kind of anxiety problem but I was still scared because it felt like I was never going to be able to breathe again. The other people noticed I was freaking out, and they walked me outside and were trying to console me. I think someone went and got the teacher because she came outside and told the other people to leave while she made me sit and was coaching me on my breathing. After a few minutes I was a bit better but I was almost crying so she gave me some space, and when she was back I told her I was fine and went back inside. I was still shaking and occasionally my chest felt like it tightened again, but I felt okay, and luckily I got to go home after that. I was very stressed after that because I am afraid of it happening again, but so far it has not.

2022-11-05 14:06:05,Anxiety,"So i just experienced an anxiety attack and this is the worst one i have ever had. My hands started shaking my back was arching and i felt like i couldn’t breathe trying to grasp for air. This gets progressively worse aswell as my hand shaking more and more erratically. I felt like i was going pass out or die as i was struggling to breathe so much. My eyes were also moving around in different directions so fast. So i just wanted to know how normal is this experience?

Also the after affect was one which i have also never experienced before. I felt myself become detached from my body. For quite a while after my eyes were just wide open like it was the only bit left of my body that i was connected to. Although my body felt exhausted, slow and shut down i remained a normal demeanour afterwards acting as if nothing had just happened. I would also like to find out how normal of an occurrence is this type of after effect from an anxiety attack is? 

Thankyou for your time :)","Just experienced an anxiety attack that I’ve never felt before, is this normal?"

2022-11-05 13:34:23,Anxiety,"So backstory; I constantly get barked at, stared at etc for being “emo”. I’m literally blonde and I wear eyeliner, i don’t even listen to emo music or care much about the culture or whatever it’s referred to.

well, a month ago a group of 7 teens my age started barking at me as usual, while I was simply just trying to get groceries. I was staring down to the ground, wearing a hood covering most of my face as usual. They probably expected me to just walk away (which I usually do), but I think something literally snapped inside me.

Everything felt fake, like a scripted movie, suddenly I was PACING after them. They all split up , and i kept chasing this one dude that I recognized from previous incidents. 

He ran into a sports facility, it was around 9pm so there were only some grown ups in a room talking, I ran after. He NEVER expected me to walk straight in like i did, neither did I.

I walked into the room, 3 women, one douchebag, one very angry “emo” girl out of her mind.
I started SCREAMING at him, staring right into his eyes as he backed up and panicky responded “it wasn’t me!”. I assume one of the women was his mom, as he knew exactly where to run, and she wrapped her arm around my shoulder and lead me outside, asked me about all the details (might have thrown some extra details in there :) ) and asked me if I needed help (I was crying at this point from shock), she probably thought I was mental, but trust me, the fear in his eyes was worth it. haven’t been barked at in a while, but have seen the group.

I’ve previously thrown drinks at them, so I think this was a big leap. It was probably more dramatic than necessary, but I literally didn’t control myself, every single look and comment I’ve ever heard just boiled up inside me. 

Also, the comments and barking has affected me to a point where I walked 20 minutes instead of 4 to get groceries. i don’t do public transport in fear of teens, and cross the road whenever someone’s on the same sidewalk as me. Just some barking and looks ruined my confidence, so it was 100% deserved",I scared the shit out of a kid
2022-11-05 13:33:29,Anxiety,"Hi! New to the sub Reddit y’all can like tell me to take it down or something if it’s not what this is but… I(f20) need to vent somewhere and Reddit seemed like my only option right now. 

I’ve been living with my boyfriend for about two years now. Well I very much adore him; love him if you will… he’s my whole world. I basically avoided my full ride to college because I didn’t want to leave his side, young love I know. College wasn’t for me either way but back to my vent…

My brother announced he was getting married in November of this year and I was in between jobs as things just weren’t working out for me. I don’t have a lot of money(my brother lives about three states away meaning travel for the wedding) and I’m way behind bills. Plus it’s been awhile since I’ve spent a long time away from my boyfriend so my anxiety was peaking thinking about not being around him for long than a day or two. 

My step dad was going and my mom. My step dad is my rock… I grew more attached to him as my anxiety had told me for years that I’ve failed my mom and all her hope in me was long gone. Well… my boyfriend tried to tell me it’s just my anxiety that I’m just getting stuff in my head that isn’t true and I believed him and I believed that my step dad still had faith and was hanging to see what will happen as I grow older. 

It’s been a rough past couple of weeks past few months really and I haven’t been as close with my step dad as I used to be when I was living with my mom and him. No long night talks that helped me get through everything is basically what I mean. 

Well here we are a few states over and I’m freaking out that my step dad is losing faith in me… is upset or hurt by how I’m growing up; who I’m becoming. I text my boyfriend and call him about it but he reassured me it’s all in my head. 

Shit goes down basically and my mom blows up on me. And when she was away for a minute I had said to my step dad that my mom doesn’t really understand how she comes off sometimes about the situation she’d blown up on me about. He had said to me that I’m the same way… And the words he’d said that are hurting me the most right now are “well you either sometimes you’re nasty person”. And I’m just… I’ve been crying for probably two hours idk if it’s a panic attack or just me being overwhelmed by the truth or idk really.

It’s like everything I’ve always thought about me being a failure to my family is true and it’s hurting me so much realizing that… idk what tod o idk what to think I’m just I’m numb I guess I don’t wanna be alive anymore I just wanna disappear I wanna go off the grid… but I’m not home and my boyfriend is which is the only thing keeping me from ending it all right now cause of my whole world waiting for me to walk into those doors in a few more days…",I didn’t know if it was my anxiety… or true… I guess it was true.

Thank you In advance.,ADHD and anxiety!
2022-11-05 13:30:45,Anxiety,"Dear reddit, 

I was forcefully admitted to a psychiatric hospital when I was 12 years old. Whilst there, medication was admitted forcefully and I got assaulted by an other patient. After a week, I was transferred to a psychiatric group home for children. Whilst there, me and my group mates had swimming classes at the swimming pool located at the terrain of the psychiatric institution.

Unfortunately for me, our swimming coach turned out to be one of my countries worst child abusers. He abused multiple children in front of my face. He would subtlety touch the girls during our swimming classes. I remember standing on a floating raft and seeing our swimming teacher sit besides the girls and touching two 10-12 year old girls in their breast area. 

One day, I was the last one of our group to leave the pool. I decided to float around with my pool noodles and left the pool to get my towel and flip flops. Whilst walking back to the changing rooms, I saw our swimming coach molest a mentally and physically challenged girl sitting in a shower chair (she was wheelchair bound). He was touching her breast area and was trying to loosen her bikini top. The girl was rocking back and forth in the chair, making grunt noises and being upset (she was non-verbal). I ran back to the changing rooms, quickly dried myself off and ran back to our group. I wanted to report the incident, but I was afraid I would get into trouble. 

Fast forward 1.5 years and the swimming coach is arrested after loads of inappropriate content of his swimming pupils is found on his computer. He got a prison sentence of 6 years and left the country after his release. 

Even though I struggled with school and displayed signs of sexual abuse, the institution (which is an expertise centre for sexual violence of children) never identified the abuse. When the story broke, the institution never contacted me nor my family about the situation. 

I have kept my mouth shut for 14 years and wasn't able to tell anyone about my experience for a very long time. 5 months ago, I filled a report for recognition of my childhood trauma and this is still pending at the moment. I've been diagnosed with PTSD in 2018 and with anxiety disorder in 2019. 

Lately I'm just really struggling with this pending form of recognition from CPS/the state. I'm very anxious about the state refusing to acknowledge my childhood experiences and I was wondering if anyone has any idea what to do to get some help for me to cope with it all. Currently I'm finishing my bachelors degree in medicine and this semester is about child abuse and Psychiatry, which really hits home for me.

I was wondering if anyone has ever underwent a similar quest for recognition of their childhood trauma and what advise you would give to me. Thanks in advance!",Anxiety because I finally filed for recognition of abuse that happened to me when I was a child. (TW childabuse/sexual violence)

2022-11-05 12:29:21,Anxiety,"i wanted to make a post like this for a while. after 10 years of anxiety i’ve learned a few things. 

• your anxiety doesn’t define you, it’s just a part of you.
• people laugh at the suggestion of “naming it” but i’ve always treated my anxiety like another person. they are holding the reins right now but you are both on the same team and need to work together.
• meditation and mindfulness help but they aren’t a cure. you can’t cure a natural response and you wouldn’t want to.
• what works for one person won’t always work for you, and that’s okay!
• sometimes you have to let that other side of you win. wallow in it, suffer and then when you are ready, climb out of that hole and make the changes you want to see.
• the sensations suck, and they sometimes come in ways they haven’t before. they are just sensations, they will fade again.
• once you have one attack, you’ll likely have more and the people who say they last 10-30 minutes are liars, sensations can linger for days if you let them get to you.
• have a conversation in the mirror with your anxious self. reassure them that you don’t want to fight but rather, co-exist.
• if you’re a woman, it will probably get harder around your period because like that chemical imbalance in our brain, hormones like to go crazy around our time of the month.
• don’t read reviews online for anything, when was the last time you reviewed something when you had a good experience? majority of reviews are just the bad.
• lastly, don’t google your symptoms. this one is really hard, but before you think “this is something terrible, do i need to go to the hospital?” try to calm down first in any of the ways that you have found work for you. see your doctor and tell them any concerns, they’ll screen you if you ask them to just to ease your mind.

it’s an uphill battle but i’ve learned that sometimes that battle makes us who we are and forces us to put in that extra effort. i’m not a doctor, just someone who has dealt with this for a long time. remember you are not alone, you are not crazy, you’re just a human with an imbalance. no different then someone with janky knees or asthma. 

hope some of these help ease your mind.",GAD advice from a 23F who has had it for 10 years.

So I may need a slap in the face to bring me back to relative sanity on political matters and your general views are welcomed.

So,  I am not a US citizen, but I live in Canada. Anyway, below is my constant back and forth in my head...

The  last few years have  been stressful for some (lots) of us up here and I  may be reading too much history and doom forecasting, but I sometime  find myself afraid of  what could happen if, for example, Trump and the  GOP get their ways.  Among all the things the US citizens could go  through, I fear that the relationship between both our countries could  deteriorate and that Canada could be another proverbial Poland.

But  then, and discussing this with friends and colleagues, we catch  ourselves thinking that this is not the same as 1930's as, clearly, half   of the USA would not go for stuff like that (like both coasts which  are the big economic powers). We also think that if for some reason,   economic instability would happen, the party in power would not be able   to sustain whatever policies they wish to put forth, especially if they   are crazy. We've seen people go down in the street and its one thing  to  get ""power"" but keeping it is another.

Basically,   in my rational time, I think that I may be overthinking this, but  then, when we hear the GOP basically saying MAGA stuff, stoking hard right ideologies... I fear it  could spill  over into international relations towards something bigger.

Ultimately,   I can't foresee the day when New England friends and other reasonable   Americans and their military would seek to impose ideologies by threat  of force on old friends... but it is a present thought in my head.

Slap  me and bring some sense into me? I know I am worrying too much and I  wish I could be carefree about this, but for some reason its just been  present since 2016.

I am currently 3 months into my sophmore year of college. This past summer, I started to have panic attacks infrequently. I had one at the beginning of the summer, two within 24 hours of each other near the end of the summer (early August), and two since moving back to school. I am not currently on any medication.

Within a couple of days of moving back to campus, I began to experience chest pains, so I went to to the doctor, and it was nothing heart related, nor was it COVID. After that visit, I began to occasionally experience a spasm or fluttering in what felt like my diaphragm, and also what felt to be acid reflux or heartburn. After a few weeks, it somewhat went away, but was still there a little bit. Earlier this week, it started to come back as bad as it was two months ago. I have not been back to the doctor yet, but am thinking about going back soon if it continues to get worse again. 

Is this something anyone else has experienced? Is it anxiety related? Is it just acid reflux? Why would it start all of a sudden? I would say that I am currently more stressed out than I was for a few weeks, but I do not overall think I have been overly stressed since coming back to school, unless my body  knows I am more stressed than my brain is willing to admit? I had recently gotten off my birth control at the same time I was moving back in, but getting off bc is not supposed to result in any symptoms?

One night when he was drunk, and I think he was hanging out with another girl, he started calling me multiple times. I told him I would see him later in the night, but he kept begging and begging to see me and kept calling and calling. So I went to see him and slept with him, and during it, he was telling me that he loved me and looking down at me and telling me multiple times that he loved me. I was lying there staring at him because I didn’t know what to say. He then was like grabbing me later and telling me he never wanted me to leave.

The following day though, he acted like oh, I don’t know how he got home last night, or oh, I don’t know why I left so early, so I didn’t take what he said. I think he was upset that he left the other girl early. The last time I saw him, we hung out and drank a bit. We are fooling around a little bit and going at it several times. The last time we were having sex, I was massaging him, and he whispered to me I love you. I didn’t call him out about it, but it makes me feel weird about the relationship. I don’t know if he wants me or cares about me. have you ever had a friend with benefits say I love you during sex? Do they mean it if they say I love you during sex?",Why would a FWB say this?(26F)(28M)
2022-11-05 10:53:16,Anxiety,"So I wouldn’t say I get that bad of anxiety overall, but for some reason when trying to talk to my boss about my rates I get the worst anxiety, to the point that I can sense myself probably looking visibly uncomfortable and I hate it. Can tell by his body language too that he probably realizes I’m nervous. 

I’ve been trying to bring myself to ask for a raise these past couple meetings, but I can never seem to bring myself to do it. Im scared I’m going to get so nervous that I’ll start stumbling over my words and make myself look bad. I’m very confident in my work I do and I know I’m not easily replaceable, and they can definitely afford to give me a raise, so idk why I’m so scared to ask. But it’s getting to the point that I feel like I need to be on some sort of substance just to get the courage to do it. I’ve never taken any anxiety meds in my life so what to try to help in a situation like this. In other rare situations where I’m experiencing a lot of anxiety, I’ll honestly take a shot of liquor (sounds bad but I promise I’m not an alcoholic lol), but those are usually in situations where it wouldn’t be the end of the world if whoever I was with found out. Definitely not trying to have my boss think I’m drinking on the job unless I can hide it well. 

Anyone have any suggestions?",Should I take anxiety meds as a one time thing for a work meeting?

2022-11-05 10:42:51,Anxiety,"Hi! I’ve had some weird symptoms for three to four months now! Dizziness, fatigue, light headedness, weak muscles, trouble breathing, fast heart rate (which is calming down recently) , numbness in scalp and face, tingling arms, tinnitus, pressure in my head,  waking up before i completely sleep like i can’t breathe, and yes extreme anxiety. 

I haven’t left the house much and i’m trying to get some walks in but i get pretty dizzy and disoriented by the end of them. 

I have had SO many tests medically. I’ve done  MRI of brain, MRA of brain and neck, CT of brain, chest, and stomach, ultrasound of thyroid, so much blood was taken for so many tests, 3 echos, a 7 day holter monitor, like 20 ekgs.

I still can’t get it out of my head that it may be physical. i’m trying to go about my day pushing through and i think i’m getting better, but some of these symptoms really stop me from living my life. I’m seeing a neurologist on the 9th and my GI on the 10th. I’m afraid i have some neurological disease that is going to just make me stop breathing with acute respiratory failure or maybe i’ll go into a coma??? I know it sounds ridiculous but how do i know i DONT have something that’s gonna shut my central nervous system down? The neurologist is supposed to look at that but i haven’t been there for an EMG or EEG or NCS yet.

i'm in my final year of my master's, going to classes full time and also working 4 days a week at a hospital seeing patients. i used to love doing this work, but my anxiety has been so bad for the last couple of months that i constantly worry about having panic attacks while i'm with patients (i work in a psychiatry clinic.. the irony) which takes the joy out of the work for me. i used to feel like i could juggle school, work, the gym, and a robust social life with ease, but for the past 3 or so months, i've felt like i'm on the constant brink of falling apart. i feel like one day, i'm just going to completely break down and not be able to go on with any of my daily activities, not finish my masters, not be able to work, etc... this has never happened to me in my life, but i found myself worrying about it super often. at the end of the day, i find myself feeling relieved that i somehow finished the day unscathed, but that tomorrow could be the day something horrible happens.

this feeling is coupled with a pretty intense impending sense of doom which is awesome too :,)

when i step back, i think my life is pretty okay... i can take care of myself, i have a great long term boyfriend and great friends/fam, i get good grades, i (think) i do well at work .... so what's the deal??

does anyone else get like this? has anything helped?",does anyone else feel like they're constantly on the edge of falling apart?

2022-11-05 08:37:18,Anxiety,"&amp;#x200B;

I am male, 28 years old.

Long story short, about 4 years ago my doctor diagnosed me with anxiety/panic disorder. And things have gotten progressively worse. I wouldn't consider myself depressed, but these unexplained physical symptoms are destroying my life. 

Every single day I feel as if I'm dying, or something is terribly wrong with me. I've done numerous different testing with health professionals. ECG's, CT scans, blood work, cardiologist appointments,  Gastroenterologists appointments, and yet they all tell me everything looks perfectly normal. But I feel far from normal. Its hard for me to believe them or accept that there isn't something more. On top of all the tastings, I've tried numerous different anti depressants that have been prescribed to me, and non of them seem to make a difference. The only thing that seems to give me a little bit of releief is taking 2mg of Clonazepam, which I don't believe is healthy. 

Just to list some of the ways I feel : I feel like I cant breath properly (like I cant get a full breaths and im suffocating), choking sensations when I'm swallowing food, tightness in chest, limbs feel like rubbery noodles on and off, weakness and loss of motor function sometimes in my wrists and hand, weak in the knees, feeling like I'm going to faint or collapse. The list goes on, but those are the main symptoms that cause me the most grief. 

This illness has taken over my life. I struggle immensely to do the things that i love. I have trouble playing with my daughter, I struggle to work my job everyday (I'm an industrial mechanic, so loud, hazardous settings definitely do not help my situation), and I am struggling to take part in physically activity that I love, like football, because it feels like I'm going to have a heart attack and faint when running. 

I'm at the point now, where I almost feel like death would be better than how I feel everyday. This illness feels like its taken away a lot of my young years, and my quality of life is awful. 

I just prey I can find a remedy and somehow be saved from myself and this illness. 

If anyone has any advice, words of wisdom, or care to share their experience, I would love to hear it.

2022-11-05 07:49:04,Anxiety,"Hey Everyone: **Destroying and Overcoming and Vanquishing ANXIETY and FEAR** and related issues thanks to the following text!!!  
\~ ***The Urantia Book*** (which is a divine revelation (1955) free online to read etc, and it's also already in the public domain):  
(excerpt just below about How To Vanquish ANXIETY...)

&gt;' 6. The Young Man Who Was Afraid  
130:6.1  (1437.1) While they were up in the mountains, Jesus had a long talk  with a young man who was fearful and downcast. Failing to derive comfort  and courage from association with his fellows, this youth had sought  the solitude of the hills; he had grown up with a feeling of  helplessness and inferiority. These natural tendencies had been  augmented by numerous difficult circumstances which the lad had  encountered as he grew up, notably, the loss of his father when he was  twelve years of age. As they met, Jesus said: “Greetings, my friend! why  so downcast on such a beautiful day? If something has happened to  distress you, perhaps I can in some manner assist you. At any rate it  affords me real pleasure to proffer my services.”  
130:6.2 (1437.2)  The young man was disinclined to talk, and so Jesus made a second  approach to his soul, saying: “I understand you come up in these hills  to get away from folks; so, of course, you do not want to talk with me,  but I would like to know whether you are familiar with these hills; do  you know the direction of the trails? and, perchance, could you inform  me as to the best route to Phenix?” Now this youth was very familiar  with these mountains, and he really became much interested in telling  Jesus the way to Phenix, so much so that he marked out all the trails on  the ground and fully explained every detail. But he was startled and  made curious when Jesus, after saying good-bye and making as if he were  taking leave, suddenly turned to him, saying: “I well know you wish to  be left alone with your disconsolation; but it would be neither kind nor  fair for me to receive such generous help from you as to how best to  find my way to Phenix and then unthinkingly to go away from you without  making the least effort to answer your appealing request for help and  guidance regarding the best route to the goal of destiny which you seek  in your heart while you tarry here on the mountainside. As you so well  know the trails to Phenix, having traversed them many times, so do I  well know the way to the city of your disappointed hopes and thwarted  ambitions. And since you have asked me for help, I will not disappoint  you.” The youth was almost overcome, but he managed to stammer out,  “But—I did not ask you for anything—” And Jesus, laying a gentle hand on  his shoulder, said: “No, son, not with words but with longing looks did  you appeal to my heart. My boy, to one who loves his fellows there is  an eloquent appeal for help in your countenance of discouragement and  despair. Sit down with me while I tell you of the service trails and  happiness highways which lead from the sorrows of self to the joys of  loving activities in the brotherhood of men and in the service of the  God of heaven.”  
130:6.3 (1437.3) By this time the young man very much  desired to talk with Jesus, and he knelt at his feet imploring Jesus to  help him, to show him the way of escape from his world of personal  sorrow and defeat. Said Jesus: “My friend, arise! Stand up like a man!  You may be surrounded with small enemies and be retarded by many  obstacles, but the big things and the real things of this world and the  universe are on your side. The sun rises every morning to salute you  just as it does the most powerful and prosperous man on earth. Look—you  have a strong body and powerful muscles—your physical equipment is  better than the average. Of course, it is just about useless while you  sit out here on the mountainside and grieve over your misfortunes, real  and fancied. But you could do great things with your body if you would  hasten off to where great things are waiting to be done. You are trying  to run away from your unhappy self, but it cannot be done. You and your  problems of living are real; you cannot escape them as long as you live.  But look again, your mind is clear and capable. Your strong body has an  intelligent mind to direct it. Set your mind at work to solve its  problems; teach your intellect to work for you; refuse longer to be  dominated by fear like an unthinking animal. Your mind should be your  courageous ally in the solution of your life problems rather than your  being, as you have been, its abject fear-slave and the bond servant of  depression and defeat. But most valuable of all, your potential of real  achievement is the spirit which lives within you, and which will  stimulate and inspire your mind to control itself and activate the body  if you will release it from the fetters of fear and thus enable your  spiritual nature to begin your deliverance from the evils of inaction by  the power-presence of living faith. And then, forthwith, will this  faith vanquish fear of men by the compelling presence of that new and  all-dominating love of your fellows which will so soon fill your soul to  overflowing because of the consciousness which has been born in your  heart that you are a child of God.  
130:6.4 (1438.1) “This day, my  son, you are to be reborn, re-established as a man of faith, courage,  and devoted service to man, for God’s sake. And when you become so  readjusted to life within yourself, you become likewise readjusted to  the universe; you have been born again—born of the spirit—and henceforth  will your whole life become one of victorious accomplishment. Trouble  will invigorate you; disappointment will spur you on; difficulties will  challenge you; and obstacles will stimulate you. Arise, young man! Say  farewell to the life of cringing fear and fleeing cowardice. Hasten back  to duty and live your life in the flesh as a son of God, a mortal  dedicated to the ennobling service of man on earth and destined to the  superb and eternal service of God in eternity.”

I’m young but my anxiety makes me feel like I’m about to drop dead. Im in therapy, I try different coping mechanisms, but it really frustrates me that whenever I go to see the doctor about some of my more concerning symptoms like heart palpitations or dizziness, I have the symptom treated and not the root cause of whatever is happening to me. 


I’m going to start looking into integrative medicine and hopefully find a doctor that can run more in-depth tests and maybe figure out alternative lifestyle changes I can make. I’ve always been anxious but I really wonder if in the last year going off birth control or my sudden weight gain has been a factor. It’s gotten so much worse in the last two years that’s I don’t even recognize myself. I wonder if it’s hormonal. 

Have any of you on here had a similar experience and then tried an anti-anxiety diet, or a series of supplements, or even did further testing and found out that the anxiety was coming from some thing that regular doctors wouldn’t test for??

2022-11-04 13:50:04,Anxiety,"Hey guys! This is my first time in this sub and after thinking for a while I think I have to come clean. So i’m 24M and i’ve had anxiety issues since I was around 10 and the issues have essentially manifested physically with CPPS after an injury.

Heres a bit of my background. Recently I joined the army since its mandatory where I live and it’s something I wanted to do in my life. Before enlisting, I was really just on another planet freaking out about everything and my CPPS (pelvic floor pain) was exacerbated. I enlisted I felt better but obviously not 100% and now I got in a predicament that has made me very anxious. I’m ending my beginning course meaning i’m going to be doing a lot of changes again like loosing my friends i made and being comfortable, plus I had issues getting the job I want (still fighting for it) but was put in an infantry brigade which I don’t know if I can handle.

Due to this my CPPS got WAY worse and now I realize after coming home for the weekend and having a pretty restless night I really have an anxiety problem. Also good time to add 100% is genetic my dad has an anxiety disorder that basically controlled his life. And I used to have major panic attacks in the past and can have “scares” I call them but very mini episodes every so often.

My CPPS is a separate story maybe someone has it too, but it was caused by an injury falling and most likely doing minor spinal damage but my pelvis never fully recovered and the tensing from anxiety is preventing me from healing and making my symptoms far worse. Its effected my daily life and is truly my problems physically manifested.

So I know this is already a lot, but I don’t have many options but one this is for sure: now more than ever I want to beat my anxiety. I’ve tried therapy never worked, I find it better to talk to friends. So I think I first need to figure out how I will deal with it and overcome anxiety, and also things I should do. I don’t want to use medication, and I think supplements are much better for helping aid it and which ones are best that anyone recommends? And ultimately what do I do to beat my anxiety once and for all? What are the steps and goals I need to achieve?

Thanks!",Anxiety and CPPS

2022-11-04 13:33:34,Anxiety,"So im noticing that when people have panic attacks or really bad anxiety. They typically get a sudden increase in their heart rate. Suddenly theyll find their heart going 160 BPM. But thats nit what ive experienced when i get attacks. Instead of getting faster, my heart just skips a lot of beats. Now the people who get the increase in heart rate have mentioned that they get skips too but, the increased heart rate seems to be the main symptom. Its the opposite for me. It starts with skipped beats. The skipped beats continue. And only a few attacks, ill get an increased heart rate.
Idk is it the same for anyone else?
I remember before i started getting frequent panic attacks in highschool, i had these palpitations in middle school
I remember running a mile around the track and afterwards my heart would go ""beat beat skip beat beat skip beat beat skip"". And it would keep doing that until ive finally caught my breath after running.
But when my depression got really bad in highschool, thats when the panic started. I would notice my heart skipping beats like it did when i ran on the track, but this time, they happened when i was lying down. And they got worse when i started panicking I saw a cardiologist. My ekg was normal. Of course it was. I wasnt having palpitations when they took it I wore a monitor for a week. And sent it in. And i never beard back from them. But somehow, my anxiety dissipated, and i was able to live my life again. Idk how
But now. Four years later. Im getting them again.
Except this time its every other beat. And it happens when i take a shower. Or whenever im too active after an exhausting day.
They are horrifying and theyre all i can think about. Ive had palpitations before. Im usually able to brush them off. But not these specific ones that occur for a few minutes at a time. Just. SKIP BEAT SKIP BEAT SKIP BEAT.

2022-11-04 13:11:27,Anxiety,"I have several anxiety disorders (general and social) as well as depression and ADHD. I've always been bright at school (when I can keep my attention) and love school. Hell, it's ine of my goals to teach in the future. But in the past few years because of plenty different circumstances I've had crazy trouble with school. I got accepted into my dream university (great!), and moved to another state for school. I got my own appartment, got a job. All good. But then... my anxiety for everything...
I never really looked into getting help, I intended to, thought it was a good idea, but never got to it.
Finally, about a year and a half ago I finally started getting help. Got a specialty personal mental/academic coach at my university as well as (very recently) a therapist.
And really, since then, I've gotten so much better! I've felt optimistic and getting things done since then. Been great. But, because of side circumstances, even though I've been doing good, I decided to take a one term break.

Just ONE term. Not the hole year, just one term. Just wanted to give myself some time to cover some personal goals and other small troubles and still have time to breathe.

So, I decided to take a break this term.

All good, fine. But then, last month, I was in a small car accident. I was fine, and my Dad was able to travel up here and help me fix it up so I didn't have to pay. And my car's all good now. The issue is, I wasn't able to work while my car was down (I Doordash for an income right now), which set me back about a half month in expenses. And now, I make up for my lost time it looks like I am litteraly going to have to work full non-stop for the next month. No weekends, no breaks. 11 hour days for the next 23 days! Just so I don't lose my apartment.

Now, my family has helped me out with money in the past. But, right now, everyone's broke. Most of my family has been out of work lately because of there own medical issues. So asking them for help is a no. And I have 0 friends at all anymore so no help there.

So, my only option right now, it seems, is to work none stop for the next 3/4 weeks.

And really this wouldn't bother me if I still had time to get my personal stuff done that I took this break for. But, after I get caught up financially, it looks like I'll have only a month to get to the stuff I wanted to. And that's not enough time.

And so... I'm arguing with my self if I should take another term off, my winter term, and wait until spring to start back. But, if I do, I'm terrified of the constant pattern I always hear of. If you take a break from school you'll likely not return. And even though I love school, I really want to take an even longer break. But, I'm terrified if I follow in the pattern of many others of not returning.

And that terrifies me...

I don't know. Not really looking for advice, just wanted to spitt out my anxiety...

Thank you.",I'm tempted to take an even longer break from school

I also get very faint in the head and things start to go a little black sometimes. It gets a little bit harder to breathe too, and it's VERY hard to think. That also leads me to sometimes say the wrong stuff and just sound angry which makes me feel even more dumb as I'm not articulating what I want to say correctly. Does anyone know if this is related to anxiety and if not then please direct me to the correct subreddit, because I would really love to know how to make myself not feel this way? Some way of coping would help, as therapy isn't really an option for me. My household is very against therapy.

2022-11-04 11:45:08,Anxiety,"Low intelligence or anxiety?

Quick question?!

I've been on the verge of thinking I have low IQ. BUT, I have my CNA and passed that.. some people don't. Anyways, my therapist said I'm average intelligence and she doesn't think I have an intellectual disability, but I did miss a lot of school in my learning years. So I was placed in special education, I had normal classes for all of them just some had a paraprofessional. They put me in cause i fell behind due to missing a lot. I do have ADD, got diagnosed in middle school. I have this thought that staggers around my head that I'm intellectual disabled or impaired. Everyone around me says I'm fine, but I keep obsessing over it. I took a few Mensa tests and the first time I took Norway I got 88 then I took Denmark and got 102. Like I said my therapist said in order to pass my CNA I'd need to have average intelligence. Is she right? 
The ladies at work always say I do a great job and got employee of the month after two months being here. I've been a CNA 5+ years and I felt like after that I started to mess up I switched to the hospital. Do you think the nurses think I'm dumb? Idk I'm so worried. 
This is strange I know, but I was considering moving to Texas and I thought of the list of things I needed to do. Like look into insurance, jobs, wondering about my taxes. Am I normal? Or am I just low IQ? I KNOW I shouldn't be asking on here. 


Wouldn't they found it before turning 25!?",Is this all in my head?

(22F) I’ve been on medication for my depression and anxiety but I don’t think it’s working. As far as I’m concerned (although I haven’t taken every single med in the world) I feel that nothing will work. I’m constantly on edge and even if something has nothing to do with me, I put my emotions into it and stress more than usual. I have a job that I love but there’s someone there who makes it difficult as they pick on me for everything I do and make it out to seem like I’m dumb. Being home is enough for me to lose my mind as I have no friends, but work isn’t an escape as I’d like it to be. I’m extremely sensitive, cannot take constructive criticism most of the time, a slow learner (which does upset people sadly) and very chatty to the point where I reveal too much and become annoying to those around me. I’ve been isolating and becoming more introverted, more scared of the world and I know people say live life to the fullest but I just can’t, it won’t happen — I have an extreme fear of death and am afraid that once I loosen up and become more happy/out there I’ll die suddenly. I know this is all over the place, but my brain simply cannot process putting it all in paragraphs together that will make sense. I need help understanding myself (yes I have a therapist/psych) and understanding the real world..I have a bad habit of spending heaps of money when I’m depressed too, I’ve tried budgeting but it doesn’t work. I put myself into predicaments every time and tell myself that it’s okay cause I’m going to k*ll myself anyways and I need to stop.

It will be like on all day long, with minor ebbs and flows. Lately my left jaw line will get mildly tingly and I’ll get shaky too. This has been off and on for many days now.  I’m hypothyroid but had that checked and I’m still within my same range I’ve been for 10 years.  My vitamin D was insanely low but I’m on 50,000 twice a week now, and that’s it. I have psoriasis but don’t take anything for it.  Nothing extra about my life now but I went to the doc because my heart palpitations and feeling had me worried and my EKG was normal.  Slightly elevated BP.  Normal heart rate.  Anyone had similar symptoms and it wasn’t just anxiety? I smoke almost one blu ecig pod per day which may contribute as previously it was half.  It just feels like more than anxiety but at my last medical visit all my vitals and such were OK except vitamin D.  I have other anxiety symptoms with this, such as spaced out feeling, fatigue ( don’t sleep well anyways just up too late) and some mild dizziness.  It’s really getting in the way of life.

They did offer me a full refund which i mention in the video but i just felt like it doesn’t change the fact that this part of my wedding experience was ruined.

I have Panic Disorder, my panic attacks make me have trouble breathing, puking, and sometimes passing out. They're pretty brutal. And one of the triggers is needles / blood. I've been thinking of testing the meds with getting a piercing I've always wanted, after taking the Hydroxyzine haha.

Hey ppl! I need advice on how to deal with my hypochondria, because it is honestly quite awful. Also, really sorry for a long post lol

I haven't been able to get good sleep in like, ever, but since I developed hypochondria it became much worse. When I lay on bed I can't think of anything but my body, and I get all weird feeling from it like pressure in my chest or headaches or pain in some part of my body, etc. This all triggers my anxiety and gives me panic attacks, feelings from which trigger my hypochondria and it's all just a vicious cycle. I had an ambulance called for me twice because of this, and the first time I got hospitalise because from what I described it was quite bad, but it turned out to be ok a couple days later

Recently I had to had alot of medical tests because of some reasons not related to my hypochondria, and all of them come out fine. My brain just doesn't registre it properly, and still thinks I'm having something serious. And even the things I actually do have are not severe at all. The most severe thing I have is scoliosis. So I understand that all those feelings are irrational, and all my physical ""symptoms"" are either a things that I'm feeling because of my posture getting fixed, or because of my hypochondria causing them

Sometimes I have a random thing that triggers my hypochondria to a point of a panic attack. Like, even the smallest thing can do that. My panic attacks faded away for a while, but now they're back and they are related to me being afraid for my health 90% of the time

The worst part is that I can't get any professional help with that, because I live in rural area far from towns/cities, and because my parents don't believe in psychology, and I don't have any money yet

2022-11-04 09:05:05,Anxiety,"On my bus ride home from work, I started having some really bad thoughts. It's thoughts I've had before but I've been on medication for GAD for about a year and a half so I haven't had these thoughts in a while. I'm nervous to express what the thoughts actually are because 1. I'm embarrassed and 2. I'm scared of voicing it, like something bad will happen if I do. But it's existential dread kind of anxiety, makes my stomach drop, and I feel like I am dying. Any suggestions on how to get out of this existential dread feeling? I'm trying to distract myself but anytime I'm free, it's there again. 

Thank you.",Bad anxiety night.
2022-11-04 08:59:51,Anxiety,"I'm not a super talkative person usually, but recently I've been trying to break out of my shell a little bit. At school, usually I'm very quiet, I play games or watch netflix on my phone during lunch, and I don't try to initiate hanging out after school unless I'm really comfortable. My school friends are used to this, and they like to have me there just cause, which makes me really happy. But I've been trying to overcome some of my anxiety, so I'm trying to put myself out there, but I think people don't like me when I do this, or even when I speak, and it's making me really paranoid and upset.

Few examples, I got some guts to speak up about a mentor text we were annotating, and everytime I spoke everybody just went dead silent. My teacher is an absolute angel, and she smiled at me and added to my points, but it made me feel so uncomfortable and unwelcome how everybody just stopped. She tried to push me a little more to share, but I got nervous and forgot what I wanted to say which kind of caused a scene, which made me feel even worse. And the biggest mess up happened at dinner about half an hour ago, where my family and I were making sarcastic jokes like we usually do, although I was more into it today than usual, but then I said something mean about my sister not having a boyfriend, and my family got quiet. My mom told me the comment was rude and I just kinda said ""yup i know"" out of panic because I really didn't know it was going to sound rude. It gets like this sometimes, where I don't feel comfortable talking to my family, even though we're so close, because of things like this. Either they're being judgy towards me or I'm accidentally causing a scene, but now with this happening my fears about people only tolerating me feel like they've been confirmed.

Should I just stop putting myself out there and be more reserved? I feel like a total dick, I didn't mean to upset her and I really don't care if she's dating or not, I just want to not feel like such a burden on the people in my life. I've just been starting to get over the feeling that everybody hates me, but now with these 2 things and a few more incidents I feel like I'd be better off closing up again. I don't want to make anymore mad or upset at me anymore, it feels like that's only thing I ever do.",I feel like people hate when I talk

Rationally, I understand that I spend WAY too much worrying about certain things and even about things I don't have to worry about period, but my irrational mind is really good at justifying my rumination.

Is there a way that you're able to tell the difference between ""this is a reasonable amount of worry for this thing"" and ""there is literally no use worrying over this""?

I know that I should let go of things out of my control, but I tend to also worry about future things that are indirectly in my control (see what I mean about being good at justifying my anxiety?).

For example, I worry a lot about how other people perceive me, so I will spend hours worrying about saying the wrong thing when I talk to them. Technically, the way I present myself is in my control, but at the same time, I technically have no control over what other people think of me.

So a bit of background about me, I'm not sure if it's mild autism or just my anxiety but I have a REALLY hard time making and keeping friends.

Here is where the anxiety comes in, I think its due to my low confidence and the lack of other people I felt safe and connected with I just have this sense of dread that I am annoying him. It's not his fault, he is nothing but kind and so so caring to me. I just have a terrible anxiety that he hates me or thinks I am annoying and is gonna leave. It's not his fault, he has done literally nothing to make me logically think this, its just my anxiety.

I went through this thing where I thought I was choking every time I took a bite of food, my heart would jump in my throat, I couldn’t eat anything dry or brittle or hard. I basically just ate yogurt and soups for like a month because I was so scared of choking. This also just came out of no where.

I also wake up at night sometimes gasping for breath cause I feel like I can’t breathe. Happens more often while I’m about to fall asleep. 

I don’t have any health issues that I’m aware of. I had a phase when I was 14-16 where I’d OD on caffeine every day (like 500-700, sometimes 800mg of caffeine a day, it was bad) but now I just drink coffee in the morning. I went to a doctor, and they said I’m fine.

I just, feel like I’m dying, often, very often, and I’m not sure how to make it any better. I just kind of deal with it. I’m experiencing chest pains from anxiety as I type this.

I remember how scary it was, two months later, she was diagnosed with schizophrenia (and I lost her forever). This, what happened (3 years ago) still haunts me.

2022-11-03 15:31:05,Anxiety,"Hey, everyone. Know some people on my main account, so using my throwaway. CONTENT WARNING: if you do not like reading about medical issues, throwing up, physical illnesses relating to digestion, or eating disorders, please stop reading.

I have GAD, and I know this is just that messing with me, but I just need to rant. I'm not looking for advice, really, just support, especially if you've gone through something similar.

A few years ago, I was really ill. Throwing up almost every day, sometimes multiple times a day. I saw 7 doctors, all of whom refused to listen to me. I was a teenage girl throwing up, so of course it wasn't real, I just had an eating disorder. One of them diagnosed me with an extremely obscure eating disorder (Rumination Syndrome, if you are interested, I don't recommend reading about it on a full stomach) that didn't match my symptoms at all and prescribed behavioral therapy. Every single one of my doctors worked to convince me that it was all in my head.

Spoiler alert!! It wasn't!! they forgot to do a test they should have done months beforehand. People's gallbladders are supposed to work at 90-95% efficiency, mine was working at 11%!! I had an extreme case of a common disorder (Biliary dyskinesia), which basically made my gallbladder writhe around while trying to work, making me puke. Had the gallbladder out, perfectly fine. Well, except for the fact that constantly throwing up gave me a hernia and permanent ""significant"" acid reflux.

A couple years later, and I'm doing great. On medication for acid reflux, only been sick a couple times since then.

Except for now. I'm really sick, and I know it's just the flu or something, but I'm puking over and over again and each time it feels like being back in the middle of it.

I don't know how to explain how hard and frustrating it is to have a chronic illness and not be taken seriously. I thought I left all of that pain and anger in the past, but here it is.

I'm just so terrified it's back for good. Maybe that wasn't really the problem, maybe it is just my brain, maybe I'll be like this forever, maybe maybe maybe. Logically, I know it can't be it. My gallbladder is long gone, it's impossible for me to have the same thing that made me sick.

I'm just scared, in pain, and still so angry and traumatized from my experience. If you got this far, thank you for listening to me rant.",Terrified my illness is coming back

I could see everything so much clearer and the trees looked so much more beautiful than they previously had. Moreover, I’ve realized I am bold and assertive. I dont take crap from people anymore and speak up when i dont like what someone says. I feel in control of myself. I feel like ive been living with a blindfold on for the past few years of my life. I was very surprised with myself when i started talking back to this person who was getting on my nerves. Or when I recognized this person from one of my classes in public, and I approached them and started talking to them. I have very little hesitation when speaking or acting on things. I now realize that theres been this part of me that was missing, or better yet, that this part of me was trapped in a closet. It feels like ive taken an axe to that closet door, yanked out that part of me, and threw it on. I feel like the guy from that movie named Limitless. Where the guy takes that pill and turns into a proactive genius. It’s like I was the only one who couldn’t see myself for what I truly am. Amazing. Intelligent. Attractive. Responsible. Kind.

I’m so anxious nowadays I can’t even sleep without getting a panic attack first. The dizziness, difficulty breathing, fatigue, irregular heartbeat, etc is so overwhelming.

2022-11-03 13:42:50,Anxiety,"This is my first post on here, literally just looked this subreddit up just to get some insight as I don't really have a lot of people to talk to, let alone to bother with talking. I don't really have a lot of friends and the girlfriend I had lied to me about her friends dying and when I suspected it she blocked me. That's a whole thing that no one cares about. The main thing is, I want to put myself out there and I've been trying to really hard recently. I tried to talk to people that interest me at my online school, but to no avail. During class no one seems to acknowledge me. I don't *think* I am that weird, uninteresting or unapproachable but I assume if I get better at putting myself out there, maybe I can make new friends or possible serious relationships; people that care about me and that I can turn to with my problems and concerns.   


I talk to my therapist about it and I just can't really handle the ""real-life"" setting (yeah, I know it's stupid) and would be more comfortable with meeting people online. However, there are massive tradeoffs to that; trustworthiness, you don't physically see them, no body language to read, etc. I'm pretty confident in my ability to stay cautious but I just don't know how to start. I mean, the only thing I can think of is VR Chat, yet the demographic that comes to mind when playing that game leaves me with a horrible taste in my mouth; narcissists galore, and people with fake personalities. And still, I'm fine with using VR Chat as an outlet even with those drawbacks if it means I make at least some progress, or learn something. I just don't know how to start. What do I do? Just jump into a random world and say hello? Like, just get right into the thick of it? Because I don't know why I'm just so scared, and if you asked me why, I could either think of a lot of answers or none. Sorry for the rambling, guess I'd just like some advice or some encouragement.

I'm the baby of the family and somehow I came out looking ugly, I look like trailer trash. I've struggled with my weight all my life. I had it off in HS, but now I packed it on plus some, I get no dates, no numbers and the only time I'm partially flirted with is online. Even then guys treat me like a hookup, like I'm an easy target cause I'm fat. I've had guys come up to ask me about my sister and even my mom when I thought they were coming up to talk to me. The pounding of the heart leading up to it, and them mentioning that I should tell my sister to go out and dance on the dance floor when we went out dancing. Or her being approached to dance when I've been going there for months upon end. 

It fucking sucks, pretty privilege exists. It's funny when people tell me I have to wait for the right person, lol. Nah, I'm fat there's no right person for me. I got told to stand away from her and MAYBE guys wouldn't be intimidated to come up to me with my sister being in my presence but guys have no issues coming up to her when she's around me.

She worked as a bartender and I can't imagine what kinda comments she got. I got told that no one would come up to me infront of her.

2022-11-03 11:56:10,Anxiety,"I have always had some anxiety and depression and it comes in waves comes and goes and whatnot throughout my life. But it's always been very manageable when I had pretty good quality of life up until a couple years ago after I was introduced to kratom. Throughout my twenties I partied quite a bit and it got more frequent and serious towards my later 20s but addiction and drug abuse were never a focal point and didn't seriously hamper my life in any way.

But since daily abuse of Kratom it's been a stepping stone to alcoholism and now since using for a couple years gotten to the point of bringing out my anxiety and depression to such extreme levels that I'm very dysfunctional have a hard time coping and being a functional adult.

I've always been really good and knowledgeable about health spirituality and very in tune with that sort of thing but I also had this side of me that like to have fun be social and party. So I know the tendency was there but now it's gotten so exacerbated and surfaced from Kratom and alcohol that I need help and it's hard to stop I've quit so many times but have relapsed the longest I've made it was 33 days and since this relapse for a month I'm having a hard time getting back on the wagon it's very scary.

I have gone to the doctor and have discussed with them my concerns and my difficulties and have been prescribed buspirone Lexapro and Wellbutrin but I haven't given any of them a chance part of me wants to let my brain heal and do the holistic thing because I know given the chance my baseline state of being is very much functional and mentally and physically pretty healthy.

But now I'm starting to slowly kill myself and it's really hard to take care of myself and I don't want to let myself go down this road anymore. Should I use the motivation of throwing in the towel and giving antidepressants a chance and give that a go and just let that be a stepping stone to getting through this brutal phase that I can't seem to snap out of long-term? 

I recently tried Xanax and it provided a huge relief should I consider something like that to quit the alcohol and the Kratom and to help get me through a few weeks?

Thank you all for being here and would love to hear your input.  I definitely need to be more proactive with therapy and meetings and get help but I feel so isolated and antisocial with the state that I'm in I don't want to end up being some lost cause you can't function and get by in society I can't and I won't let that happen....

2022-11-03 11:46:01,Anxiety,"A local nightclub was having Halloween themed nights all through the weekend, and since I've been putting myself out there more lately, I decided I'd go. The first night I went was actually a fairly decent time. Now, I didn't necessarily interact with anyone, but after I consumed a few drinks I got into the right mood, went to the dancefloor and had a good time bopping to the music. They played a bit of everything: some house, edm, pop, hip hop, etc.

The second night, however, went pretty badly, and it was a total 180 from how the previous night turned out. I waited in line for around 45 minutes, but luckily the weather wasn't too cold. As I looked around, I was surprised to see not too many people were dressed up. This was on Halloween night, by the way. I was wearing a wig and a small wizard hat – nothing too extravagant. After a while though, this girl who suddenly stood next to myself waiting for her friend began talking to me, asking if I was excited. I'm not used to having conversations with people, so for whatever reason I responded by saying that this was my second time being at a club. She seemed confused, ""like, ever? how old are you?"" I didn't want to tell her my real age out of potential embarrassment (23), so I said I'm 20. She then asked when I was born, and I said ""in July, 2001."" That's when it all began to fall apart, because she quickly realized I was lying by doing the math, ""but wait, that'd make you 21 then."" I nervously laughed, ""sorry, I'm just kinda drunk"" (I wasn't). She asked me my name and if I was currently in school, and I fucked up again by saying ""I think so, yeah."" She then looked at me with a confused look, ""... You think so? (name), you're really confusing! I'm having a hard time understanding you."" Her friend eventually arrived, and I then asked if she wanted my Instagram, to which she said ""Sure... we can be, like, friends."" The rest of the conversation was fairly stilted and awkward on my part, and I could tell she felt uneasy and uncomfortable. She then waded off with her friend and that's when we stopped talking.

Eventually I got into the club, and my objective was to get into the right headspace by having a few drinks – to hopefully forget about all of that. Unfortunately, it just wasn't happening, even after downing five drinks throughout the night. I only just felt a bit tipsy a few hours in. I went to the dancefloor, but for over half the night they only played shitty rap remixes, which I'm not into whatsoever. So, I sat in the lounge area for a while. By the time they actually began playing different music, it was just generic pop like Britney Spears or Black Eyed Peas.

I didn't see anyone alone, and almost everyone was with their friends. I felt very out of place, and stood out in a bad way. I wanted to avoid that girl, but I did cross paths with her a few times in the night. The first time we walked passed each other, she looked at me with a stone face. The second time I accidentally bumped into her on the dancefloor, and she seemed annoyed at first, but then shouted at me, ""I've seen you too many times tonight, (name)!"" She looked like she was clearing her throat, saying in a light tone, ""You're freaking me out, (name)!"" I couldn't hear her at first over the music, ""What!?"", and she repeated herself, ""I said you're freaking me out!"" She then looked away and disappeared into the crowd. As I was leaving, I saw her sitting on a couch with her friend, and she pointed at me while talking into her friends' ear. I just waved and immediately left. I did her a favor by unfollowing and blocking her right after. In a way, it's a good thing I was wearing a wig and a hat; it concealed my actual look/identity somewhat, so hypothetically if she ever saw me again, she likely wouldn't recognize me.

So, yeah, it was bad. I felt like a failure, a weirdo, and a loser. I kept thinking, ""This isn't me. What am I doing here?"" I want to have fun, and make the most of my 20's, but when you have no friends and zero social skills, it's difficult to get anywhere in life.",How to recover from a bad social experience?

2022-11-03 10:32:13,Anxiety,"Currently trying to fight a panic attack that just decided to come on for no apparent reason (well, I guess I have reasons, just not sure what the trigger was.)

But whenever I have a major anxiety attack, I feel like my joints are so stiff that it's hard to move at all. My eyes only focus on one spot and it's an effort to visually focus on anything else. I have to consciously remind myself to breathe or else I'll either hold my breath or hyperventilate. My jaw is cleched so hard it hurts. 

My mind feels like that static screen on television. Even my thumbs, as I'm typing this, feel like they are grinding to a halt. 

I want to call for help, but I can't. Speaking feels impossible. My neck is so stiff right now from holding the same uncomfortable position. I tell myself to move but my body feels so delayed. Like I'm not even in it. 

I know all of this sounds super exaggerated, but my anxiety really feels like it's paralyzing me.

2022-11-03 09:36:06,Anxiety,"I don't want to sound like I'm totally careless or something, I've cared so much to making sure the pets I've had would have the best care possible, but usually that's just ended up with me worrying too much about doing everything correctly and being scared the pet won't be happy.

First pet I had was a hamster, and I got him exactly the right care with a big space to burrow in and everything, but he was really skittish and I had no idea it'd be so scary for me to try and socialize with him. Every time I had to, I felt such anxiety towards if he'd bite me or if I was doing stuff right. I kept him for some months and always tried to take care of him and socialize with him but he honestly just didn't want to and sometimes hamsters don't, so my friend who wanted a hamster (previous hamster owner got him instead and still takes care of him).

Second pet(s) I had were two rabbits. I was dumb and younger at the time and thought it was cruel to have them in a cage at night and so I had them free-roam and I really couldn't handle that and all the poop and pee they'd leave around the room which is definitely on me for not knowing keeping them in a cage during the night would've helped. If I could, I would have bought a cage for them so we could keep them. Instead, we had to leave them back to the breeder (not backyard breeder or something). I felt a lot of anxiety around then too but I know that I wouldn't have had they not been so hard to litter train (I know it would've taken time but with me being in school irl at the time it was really hard).

Okay, so like, my question is: would it be a good or bad idea to get a dog? (an elder dog from a rescue)

My family is not up for it, but I've made improvements with my anxiety and depression and overall wellbeing this year but get very lonely as I don't have school (because of social anxiety, it's until next semester when I'll start online school) or have any irl friends and don't go out that much unless I have to do something.

That's why like having a dog to go on walks with etc. could be nice to actually have a schedule and a friend to hang with. I don't mean as a sort of dependency on the dog and I know it would be difficult even if it were an elder but it wouldn't be impossible.

2022-11-03 09:03:00,Anxiety,"So I've been diagnosed with GAD. I've had it for almost 2 years now. I've had episodes of worsened anxiety that last over a month where my anxiety will get really bad and I can't live my life. Even sitting at home trying to relax is difficult. I've come out of them successfully, and I'm currently coming out of a really bad one, probably the worst one yet. My anxiety mainly encompasses my health. I'll worry about every little symptom I have, fearing the worst possible health condition. Not surprisingly my biggest worries are the most vital organs like my heart and brain. I'll obsess over how fast my heart beats or any headache that feels slightly different. 

Well recently I've been fighting to get out of an episode. Something that keeps my anxiety at bay for me is exercise. Something as simple as a 30 minute walk at the park every day is enough to keep my anxiety from rearing its ugly head. But recently from time to time after a walk I'll start feeling an anxiety/panic attack start to set in. And a few times, it has actually progressed to that. \[TW: Possible anxiety triggering symptoms\] During the walk I'll be feeling fine, enjoying the nature around me and listening to scary stories on my headphones. But after the walk when I get home I'll randomly feel my pulse in my neck with my hands and it will be racing obviously. I'll obsess over it and then I'll start to feel the telltale dizzy/lightheaded symptom. That dizziness will also get worse when I stand up, like when you stand up too quickly, which makes me worry its not anxiety and instead cardiovascular. Then I'll start worrying that because of my sedentary lifestyle from my anxiety, my heart is unhealthy or there's something wrong with it or my lungs. 

I've had countless EKGs, X-rays, Bloodwork, and other tests as a result of hospital visits and routine doctor visits. The most recent EKG and bloodwork happened 3-2 weeks ago ordered by my new PCP. Everything came back fine other than elevated LDL levels which is another reason I'm trying to exercise more. I almost had another attack after coming home from a walk tonight but I was able to relax and only felt lightheaded which then subsided. Despite the bloodwork and the EKG and all these other tests I've had performed on me coming back fine, and I myself know that I'm fine, I can't shake the fear that something is wrong with my heart. This makes it very hard for me to want to continue exercising and expanding and evolving my exercising regime. I should also mention that this doesn't happen everytime I walk, only sometimes. So I write all of this to ask, has anyone had anxiety or panic attacks triggered by a racing heart rate? If so, how did you overcome this? Thank you.",Anxiety/Panic attack triggered by increased heart rate.

2022-11-03 09:00:06,Anxiety,"Hi there! 

For context, I am a female in my mid 20s who has been formally diagnosed with Panic Disorder with Agoraphobia, SAD and depression. I've recently just switched to a different medication (Pristiq) within the last couple of months and have been slowly rebuilding my life. 

I've noticed that I've always had a tendency to hate when I am attracted to someone. It gets stuck in my brain like a bad melody and it quickly is all I can think about. I think this is fairly normal, however I realize there is a component of anxiety to this as well. 

I've become extremely close with a guy over the past couple of months. For context, we are life long friends and we share a deep connection over a lot of different things. However, we have both made it very clear that we are not attracted to each other and I would like it to remain that way. 

This situation has fucked me up. Recently, someone suggested to him that we were dating or should date. He took this about as well as he could and politely told this person (I have no idea who) that we were just really good friends and that there was 'nothing there.' 

My friend has brought this to my attention twice and I'll be honest, he's the type of guy that when he brings up something more than once..you listen because he has a harder time expressing things that trouble him. 

I put two and two together and he was acting very awkwardly around me. He stated that he was still hung up on people thinking we are dating. I played it cool and told him that it wasn't a big deal and that we had an open friendship to where we could discuss these things. 

Well...then I began ruminating over the situation. I cried as soon as he left and became convinced that he was disgusted with me. That he found me so unattractive that is why he was acting this way ect. 

Some have suggested that he is attracted to me but cannot say something, but I disagree. He is not attracted to me, he has told me that more than once. But him acting uncomfortable has made me so upset. 

I've decided to just ask him about the situation to settle my nerves. I've been an emotional mess and I just want to settle the situation. My therapist has urged me to tell him that he did hurt my feelings because communication is always good. 

I fear that if I bring this up, I may be opening up a can of worms I am not prepared to face. For reference, he's made it very clear that he doesn't want to date me (Believe me, I know) so I'm unsure about what this is.

The appointment could not have gone worse. As the periodontist started explaining the gum grafting procedure and how many times I would need to come in, I started panicking. My heart was racing, I couldn’t breathe—all the stuff I’m used to but embarrassed and self conscious about. The periodontist noticed and said “What’s wrong with you?” I explained that I was trying to be calm and not have a panic attack, but I the procedure information was making me nervous. I said, “I know this is kind of ridiculous but could I please be knocked out for this?” She said “that would be nonsense. Nobody needs that for a gum graft.” I started crying and said “well maybe you just haven’t dealt with someone like me.

2022-11-03 07:43:25,Anxiety,"High schooler here. I've had issues basically my whole life. Nowadays I can mostly deal, except sometimes I get a bit panicky. 

One thing that never fails to set me off is unclear guidelines. Like, when you don't have anything to go on. And this teacher is the kind of teacher to mention something in passing one day and expect it for a grade 3 days later. Like, not literally, but you get the gist. She put some stuff up on the board last week with no mention it was going to be graded and I missed an assignment because I didn't finish it at home. That kinda thing. Add it seemingly random expectations about everything, and it drives me up the wall. Most teacher I can sort of feign a sense of knowing what's going on at least, because I can predict it. I can never predict this teacher because nothing she does ever seems to make sense, at least in my head. So the whole class I have 0 confidence in knowing anything that's happening.

Add in that, for me, my anxiety issues come out looking like having a really short temper. Because while I do have a short temper admittedly, when I get worked up it sorta feels like my head's just cloudy. Like, there's just stuff happening, and I can't think quite straight anymore, and then that all comes out as just being really frustrated. So now the teacher seems to think I'm just some crybaby hothead or something because I always seem to be super frustrated and I ask a lot of questions and crap. Add in me treating her like a dick occasionally, which I really shouldn't, but the whole situation just has me so frustrated with her.",I clash really bad with a teacher

2022-11-03 07:32:14,Anxiety,"I have my 2nd real night of work tonight. I was scheduled for last night, but I had a breakdown crying hysterically. My girlfriend will very understandably kick me out if I can’t hold down a job. I’m 30 years old. I feel like I’m still a child. It’s an overnight job in a grocery store, historically this kind of job bodes better for me, but I’m also in a new town and I’m just overwhelmed from every angle. I don’t even feel like I deserve to complain. I really feel like moving back in with my family is an inevitability. 

I’m gonna try to remember tonight that a job is just a way to get money. I don’t need anyone at work to like me, and I don’t need to like them. I’m not necessarily rude, I just don’t even have it in me to engage at all about anything. I just want to do my assigned tasks and then leave. 

The worst that can happen is I get fired. Even though that can feel awfully unpleasant, it won’t actually affect me any differently than if I quit. 

I’m so scared. But I have to do this. All I have to do is get dressed and show up. I can ignore how I feel. Because once I’m there, it’s just a matter of doing whatever I’m expected to do, and the time will pass on it’s own. I don’t have to do anything to make the time pass, I just need to do what’s expected of me. It’s so hard… 8 hours… it’s so long for my brain, my heart to just turn off and be a robot. But I have to do this. It’s a job and any job would be like this to an extent. And I’m not the only one that has this kind of anxiety. I can do this. It’s just a means to an end. 

I want to be a little stoned for work but I worry it can have a reverse effect where I just don’t even want to be there. Of course I’m also aware I could seriously hurt myself or someone else.

2022-11-03 07:11:48,Anxiety,"Trigger warning: health anxiety, death

Tldr; health anxiety has been really really bad this year. I'm just so incredibly stressed out, I can't function at the moment. Just really need a hug / support. And if you know any reasources for dealing with the concept of death, let me know.


I am struggling so hard this year and it has gotten so bad. I've had health anxiety / OCD since I was a kid, I'm 25 now. But wow has this year been terrible.

In the beginning of the year a neighborhood dog had jumped on me - so of course, I'm afraid of rabies for the next month. Go to multiple urgent cares, waste time and money. Ugh.

Then, I start having GI issues. Oh shit (literally!), What if it's bowel cancer?? My mom is a retired doctor and reassured me that I was fine, but that didn't help. I went to a GI specialist, and that didn't help. Finally I end up getting a colonoscopy and finally that put my bowel cancer fear to rest. 

I worried about rabies again a few times. Worried about various cancers. Went to urgent cares, doctors, all said not to worry.

Then I got a routine blood test done, and found out I have really high cholesterol and elevated liver enzymes. Now, the enzymes are due to meds likely. But the high cholesterol is familial. But damn, having actual abnormal labs is scary for me.

Then, a really bad thing happened to me that caused me to face my own mortality. I can't go into details as to what happened, because I'm not supposed to talk about it. But needless to say, I've been obsessed with my own death for like two months now. It's been a real struggle and it's making my health anxiety and OCD go into over drive.

Now I've been worried about oral cancer for the past week, and it's all I can focus on. I had a canker sore from stress, so of course I think it's cancer. It took several weeks to heal, which is longer than usual, which is why I'm worried about it being cancer. It is healing though, and the white patch on it has gone away, it's just a little swollen now. Of course, last night I was picking at the spot where it was and I caused some bleeding, which has sent me into even more panic. I haven't gone to work in several days. My mom (retired doc) says she thinks it's fine and not cancer but it's so hard for me to trust that for some reason.

I'm not looking for reassurance for my latest scare, because I know reassurance doesn't help in the long run. I am in therapy, and I've been on meds for many many years at this point. 

I guess I'm just looking for a virtual hug, some support, some cheerleading so to speak. Because it's getting to the point where I am so sick of riding these waves of panic and terror.

Also, I've started to realize that at the root cause of my health anxiety is a major fear of death. Is there anyone else here like that? Has anyone here found any good resources, philosophy, etc that has helped them reconcile with the concept of dying? I wasn't raised with any sort of religion, but my mom's side is Jewish so I've been considering looking into that, maybe that would help. Or spirituality of some kind? Idk.

Thanks for reading this. I hope that someday we'll all be in a better place mentally.",This year has been so bad

2022-11-03 07:07:14,Anxiety,"I don't know. Everything is deteriorating. I just want to go back when I was 16-17 and start over. 

Back then I would cry when I think everything goes bad but I'm just sad now. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 100 kg and 175 cm (220 pounds - 5.7) for more than a year now and I need to lose weight obviously. My parents and my family says that I should lose weight all the time and I'm trying to but it stagnated around 100. 

&amp;#x200B;

For months I don't do any work. I take a monthly grant for my MsC. degree and it's been a quarter of the full time but there is nothing done. I'm trying to get started and I did something but it's not satisfactory I guess. Last week, there was an expo that I was an attendant for my uni's stall. It was thursday and friday but I worked on designing a business card for my prof in order to give to guests whom are interested in being a sponsor on tuesday. It took so much time that I left school when it was  7 at night. At wednesday morning, I went to print shop to get the cards done and carried the stuff to the stall for expo. It was also 7 at night when I was done that day. Two days after that were the expo and it was so tiring and busy that I got sick after that and couldn't even wake up at the weekend. 

&amp;#x200B;

After that, I went to doctor on monday and because of that, I missed half of my class on that monday. So at the end of the lecture I asked for the powerpoint slide to the teacher and he said ""You should take notes. I'm not obligated to give these."". It was the only week that I went without my laptop because my body hurt and I couldn't carry. No one else took notes either and there was an exam a week later. So I said whatever and went back home to sleep. 

&amp;#x200B;

On tuesday I woke up early to take my medication and I felt like staying up. Like it was an instinct. My professor called to ask about the last week's progress and I said I got nothing done because of the expo. And he replied ""are you kidding? You are going to get in big trouble if you go on doing nothing. Expo was on two days. Where is the rest"".

&amp;#x200B;

I just explained where was the rest but not to him because I don't want to argue on phone ever and he should have known better. He knows that I worked 2 days before that to get ready and I said I am sick as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel better by now and I will work tomorrow and the day later. Actually, this might be the reason for me to study on my thesis. So I can get rid of all this. Like I can't believe. I worked hours in order to get the business card right for his liking. There was more than 30 revisions saved on that and not only I designed, I went to print that at 8 in the morning and took them back at 6. All this for ""expo was on two days"". No shit it was two days, I worked on that for two more days so we can be ready for it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Usually I treat people that I respect nice. It won't change after that. Despite I'm grateful for so much things he taught me,  this and so much else that I forgot by now was just stupid at best. And even ungrateful in my opinion. 

&amp;#x200B;

There was some more stuff that I wanted to write about but I'm tired of it by now. I don't feel any anxiety but I'm just sad and disappointed. And when I wake up, I will work hard and treat some people not as nice so I can get by. Enough is enough.",I'm Bored With All of This

So last week (and perhaps for some time before then) I had become rather lax with taking my Paxil every day. I would say I would remember about every other day. Then, the Sunday a week and a half ago — it started.

This went on for a week. No other symptoms. I could eat any other meal with no ill effects. But, if I consumed anything more substantial than toast for dinner - poop time. 

This was until it occurred to me that I am supposed to be regularly taking an SSRI (this occurred to me as I was blowing up my cousin’s dorm’s bathroom. Many thanks to him and his roommates and I’m deeply sorry) and serotonin services to regulate most GI functions so maybe things were connected and I was doing this to myself. 

This week I have been much more diligent about taking my meds and things are… solidifying into place. Even if the alarm bells are still ringing 30 minutes after dinner.

I'm worried about being too deponent to even leave the house. Last time I went into town I had a huge panic attack, and that was months ago. I live in the middle of nowhere and I don't know how I'm gonna get out of this.",Dependence on computer and phone

2022-11-02 13:55:34,Anxiety,"Several years ago I lost access to a Gmail account, so naturally I moved all the important things/services I could think of from that email to my current one.

I had tried to recover it but missed the recovery mail from Google to the recovery account and since then I have been permanently locked away.

This is because I don't have access anymore to the phone number that was tied to that email account.

In the present, I was feeling very intensely anxious about recovering that email and gave in to a very stupid impulse: getting in touch with the person that has my phone number now, which has since been recycled.

It was a business account now, from a large company. Useful anxiety would have stopped me from getting in touch with this number because they could have otherwise thought that I was trying to scam them and idk if I could be sued for this (this causes me anxiety on its own).

The person agreed and told me that they would pass me the code. I naively sent the code and, after waiting a little while, got nothing in return. The person claimed that it had not arrived so I sent it again, after which the person took a while to answer again but simply said that because of company privacy, they could not share that.

I didn't hear anything back again.

So here is me, crying and intensely desperate because I just told someone that their phone number used to be mine, so they can use that to find out the email it is attached to in Google (since they can easily figure out my name), and ask to recover the account because they have the number.

I am fairly confident that Google is more likely to believe them because this would be the first attempt in years that can provide a text message code, and this makes me concerned about them not even requiring them to provide the recovery email and going directly to the password change part.

I think I might need medical help. 

I have had personal issues with my family but it all resumes to the fact that I can only rely on myself as I am now estranged from my parents. I’ve been struggling with that feeling and have been feeling depressed. I started to skip meals, have difficulties with personal hygiene and most importantly I started getting work anxiety.

Objectively my job is good. Coworkers are ok, it’s almost fully remote and the job itself isn’t hard. But there have been stress factors and the salary is basically just enough to cover my expenses. For these reasons, I can’t motivate myself to work. I get this feeling of a pit in my stomach, my heart starts to race and I even had a panic attack that was started by a work issue (which in retrospect wasn’t even that much of an issue and it shouldn’t have). I need to keep this job but I can’t bring myself to do what I need to actually keep it.

I’ve been doing therapy once every couple of weeks but now I’m thinking maybe I need to go to a psychologist for a medicinal treatment. I’m really scared of losing my job even though I logically know even in that case I can somehow make do. I’m just paralysed with hypotheticals.

I let him know about it and he said he wouldn’t make us meet or anything like that. What I went through because of that girl was traumatic and worsened my anxiety for many years.

2022-11-02 13:13:22,Anxiety,"Hi! First time Reddit poster, long time reader. Yesterday morning I had a panic attack for the first time in my life (26m), and it felt as though I had more neurological control of my body than ever. 

Before I went into full breakdown of crying and uncontrollably shivering in the fetal position, my body was relaxed as I laid in bed. I had the sudden onset of sensitivity of my skin. Everywhere I touched (arms, face, chest, legs) became hyper sensitive. It felt as if the woman of your dreams was ruining her long fingernails gently against your skin, but it wasn’t. It was my dry, cracked, calloused hands. 

I stopped rubbing my hand against my arms, then started to feel each individual hair as they shifted back into position. Out of the blue, my wife says something about orgasms. I wasn’t paying much attention as I was trying to fall asleep, but the word orgasm echoed in my head. 

About 10 seconds later, I had the most uncontrollable orgasm of my life. My hands gripped the sheets as my chest was fully flexed. My penis going from completely flaccid to throbbingly erect, mid orgasm, without any contact. The only thing I didn’t do was ejaculate, yet. 

At this point, I was terrified. I had no clue why this was happening, I just wanted it to stop. I couldn’t control my body, or so I thought. The moment my brain subconsciously told my arm to grab my phone (for research), the orgasm stopped. My penis fell completely flaccid again almost instantly. 

After 30 seconds of googling, I arrived at the WebMD page for panic attacks. As I read down the list of symptoms, every one of them hit me as fast as I could read it. By the time I reached the bottom of the list, I was in full breakdown. Tears rolling out of my eyes, entire body shivering uncontrollably, wrapped in a blanket and my wife’s arms in the fetal position. I couldn’t stop. After about 5 minutes of this, it finally broke. 

I understand that panic attacks happen, but was this normal? Was the orgasm an early effect of the panic attack, or did I give myself a panic attack while in a heightened neurological state?! 

Thanks for any advice! I’m genuinely concerned as I’m a relatively healthy 26 year old USMC vet, this type of thing has never happened to me.",Orgasm on command during panic attack?

2022-11-02 11:13:38,Anxiety,"I have had anxiety for 10+ years now and it’s been getting consistently worse every year. It’s at the point now where I know what i’m worrying about is so ridiculous but I can’t stop thinking about the thing. I repeatedly seek reassurance from my partner that my thoughts are in fact irrational. We even laugh about it when I do it because the things I worry about are SO far fetched and I sound like a broken record because i’ll ask them the same thing over and over but even doing that doesn’t really lessen the feeling of dread inside of me and it doesn’t make my thoughts any slower or less loud. 

For example, I can’t find my hairbrush at the moment. Not a big deal it’s a hairbrush but the way my brain thinks of it is… Hairbrush is lost. It’ll probably turn up, or not because what if someone stole it? It never leaves the house so what if someone took it? They could’ve come in and stole it, idk who would do that because that’s weird…. There’s someone in the house at all times… But what if they did….

Then i’ll end up asking my partner even though I know the answer, “Nobody has stolen my hairbrush have they?” and despite the reassurance I get given that i’m being silly and we laugh about it, the thought will cycle through my brain until I find something else to worry about. 

Another example, I used my phone in a supermarket the other week and then when I got back to the car all of a sudden my passcode wouldn’t work anymore (and I KNOW I was entering it correctly) so I had to completely wipe my phone to get back in to it &amp; then I spent DAYS worrying why that happened and looking out for signs that my phone had been hacked. 

I was already constantly checking my accounts, changing all my passwords multiple times a month, checking my emails for warnings of suspicious activity etc before that happened so I think that’s why that messed with me so badly, played perfectly into my fear of cyber security. 

My question is, what is the difference between anxiety and paranoia? Is paranoia a symptom of anxiety or something else that needs addressing in a different way? I feel like i’m going crazy. It’s never been like this for me before but it feels like it’s getting out of hand. 

I’ve just started SCM therapy but not sure how effective it’ll be for me as a diagnosed avoidant as it’s heavily based on attending group sessions :(

2022-11-02 11:01:48,Anxiety,"I live in an area right outside of a major city that has a gun violence issue. I also live close to a town where a mass shooting occurred. 

Over the summer I went to a concert and there was a shooting half a block away from me. I feel guilty even having this fear because the area I live in has very low violence compared to other neighborhoods where individuals are living in a constant state of stress. I know that I am in a privileged position, But I cannot shake this fear that I am going to be shot and killed. Part of it is because violence clearly can happen anywhere in my country, so it really is a matter of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. All of my friends live in the city so every time I visit them, which is almost weekly, I’m just overcome with this sense of dread. Where I live, shootings happen on the highway even, so while I know that I’m not entirely crazy to feel the way that I do, I also feel like everyone else is less afraid than I am in some sort of way?

I don’t know, I just feel so crazy, I already have really bad heart and death anxiety so if I’m not worrying about what’s going on inside of my body then I’m worrying about the violence going on around me.

i’ve been struggling with this for a while now and i’m kind of reaching a sort of breaking point. since around april, my anxiety has skyrocketed, and instead of suffering from anxiety attacks, i’ve been puking from anxiety instead. it often doesn’t happen when i’m alone — usually when i’m with people, probably because my anxiety that it will happen in front of someone causes it to happen. it gets triggered by the smallest things — sometimes even excitement (for example i had some friends come visit me that i had never met in person before and had to leave the room to puke about five times). sometimes it’s anticipation — so i can’t really go out anymore. eating at a restaurant is pretty much unfathomable to me right now since i now get pretty anxious eating in front of people, which usually causes me to vomit. its a sort of self-perpetuating thing, i guess, especially since i have emetophobia. it’s gotten so bad lately that i’m nauseous almost all the time now.

I have been actively working on my social anxiety for the past two years. I've made a lot of improvements and have occasional set backs.

I don't want to offend them. I am getting anticipatory anxiety thinking about how to talk to them and how to deal with being at a table with strangers.

2022-11-02 08:05:16,Anxiety,"I'm new and get anxiety sometimes, advice?

So, I arrived home from work at Target feeling down for no reason. This morning started off fantastic; I was joyful, energized, and productive; however, after lunch I began to feel down and unhappy. It was like a switch was flipped, and I have no idea why. Nothing had happened, and no one had said anything. Have other people experienced this?

Do you do anything to keep you feeling motivated and positive?

Despite the fact that I've only been there for 5 days, I've already established a routine for when I arrive at work. I don't like to feel rushed, therefore I always make sure to arrive early. Occasionally I'll go to the restroom first, then collect my equipment (Zebra Device, Walkie Talkie, etc.), grab a cup of coffee, and settle in to work. I usually arrive at work a little frazzled, take a seat to collect my thoughts, and then punch in on the clock.

In terms of my mental and physical health, I feel that some days are better than others. Questions like how productive I am or how well I interact with my coworkers and the guests are examples.

I'm an introvert and I get nervous talking to people. I feel like I come across as shy or awkward. Sometimes after talking to somebody I think to myself ""That was a stupid thing to say"". Not that I say anything rude but just my response feels like it could have been better.

My coworkers aren't rude; in fact, they're all very kind and helpful. Nonetheless, I never feel like I truly ""fit in"" with the group. In the same breath, I have no interest in altering who I am merely to be accepted.

I'm standing next to them as they talk, and I can't decide if I should join in or remain silent. They were discussing the Targets in Hawaii the other day, and the topic naturally shifted to the very first Target store. Then I started remembering along with them about the old Target, complete with neon lights and a red and yellow french fry carpet, and they were all like ""I don't remember that,"" making me feel like the idiot. 

It's possible that they're not trying to exclude me at all; perhaps I just need to make more of an effort to engage with them. Even as I type this, I feel like I'm providing an answer to my own question.

Anyways, sorry for the lengthy book chapter response, haha. But i'm hoping you read all of it and would like to hear your thoughts. I sincerely appreciate it.","I started a new job and get anxiety sometimes, advice?"

So I turned to the internet to make friends. I was able to have online friends for a couple years but that's not the case anymore. My anxiety has gotten worse every year and now I'm at a point where the thought of messaging or recieving a message from someone online skyrockets my anxiety levels.  Just knowing people might respond to this post makes me anxious. Earlier this year I had a full breakdown and even puked from having a small conversation online. I want to go back to talking to my old online friends and even make new ones but it feels like an impossible task. I haven't had any communication with people outside my family for about 6 months now and I feel so lonely.  The fact that I've been diagnosed with depression alongside anxiety doesn't make this any better. :/",Friends lead to a panic attack

When I was around 17 or 18, my mom put my cat to sleep. He had cancer, and took him to the vet for a scheduled surgery to get a tumor on his face removed and the vets and my mom elected, right before the surgery, that it wasn't worth it and to just put him to sleep instead.

I had no idea until I woke up that evening, home alone with his cat carrier on the table and i called my mom to ask where he was. I didn't get to say goodbye, and my mom just left his body at the vet clinic for them to do whatever they wanted with him.

I fucking loved this cat so, so much. I cannot put into words how much he meant to me. I was so devastated. When i got off the phone with my mom i just screamed and cried my heart out.

Every now and then I'll be reminded of him. My mom told me she left the room when he was put to sleep. He had dementia, and needed to be held to calm down. I can't stop thinking of how she just left him there, alone and scared and confused in his last moments surrounded by people he didn't know. I think of how she let his body be thrown in a landfill like a piece of garbage, like no one cared about him. I worry that he was one of those rare cases that woke up at some point in between, and the thought is so horrific it's physically painful.

I resent my mom for doing this when he deserved so much better, his passing was inevitable but he deserved for it to be perfect, not the chore my mom treated it as. I regret not being there for him, not saying goodbye. I regret everything i couldn't do for him. It's been years and i still break down and bawl my eyes out over him and how unfair it all is.",Guilt and grief for my cat (TW)

2022-11-01 16:13:17,Anxiety,"I just need to get this off my chest. I work in the restaurant industry and I changed jobs a month ago from a very anxious company that was really abusive, to one that’s far more stable and my coworkers are kind and supportive. I’ve been trying to transition to my new role without  bringing in all the tension and anxiety I had from my previous job. I feel like I am finally getting the hang of it, but it’s taken me the few weeks to get settled, and feel confident. The trouble is when my manager has asked me to speed up, I’m struggling to. And she pulled me aside today and basically said she isn’t confident that I can get faster. I’ve been keeping up with the rushes and doing ok. 

She just kept repeating that I was slow, everyone is picking up my slack, and that I’d be fired if we were having the same conversation in a month. I tried reassuring her that I felt like I was improving and I think I can do it. But one of the temporary managers that is covering for the week, basically didn’t let me do my normal position and just had me helping in other ways. And it really made me feel like I couldn’t prove it to myself tonight that I could be faster. I tried a few times when others were busy, but overall I wasn’t covering the rush. 

My mind is just racing. I don’t know what to tell my brain to let it know it’s ok to sleep. I keep trying to tell it, that I’m doing fine at work, people like me, I’m capable, and I can get faster. But my mind keeps wanting to be upset. 

My coworker thinks I’ll be fine and I’m doing well. I think maybe more than anything it was all the building up of tension and the day not going as I expected. She made me wait an hour between when she told me she needed to talk and when she actually told me all that. 

Idk my confidence is just jarred. I don’t want to constantly be aware of my manager and worried about her opinion. I don’t want to be hyper vigilant, but I already am with this anxiety.

2022-11-01 14:27:33,Anxiety,"Depending on how life is at the moment, I get crying fits anywhere between once a month to once a week. And these aren’t just a couple of tears that come out of the blue. Instead, its *nonstop* crying for hours and hours on end. The tears **do not** stop pouring. I can’t quite figure out why this happens but its been happening for almost a decade now (I’m 22m and in college) and each time I just feel so empty. Its like I’m mourning something I can’t fully understand. 

If I were to venture a guess, I think its because I sometimes feel robbed of the freedom to pursue my passion in the arts (I’m from a very conservative immigrant family so this isn’t even an option). Or its a longing over the thought of what could’ve been had the circumstances of my birth been different. I also have anxiety so when I start thinking about stuff like this, I can get really worked up and often consider just leaving everything behind and running away to pursue my actual dreams regardless of how unrealistic they may be (and I actually have run away before, twice). 

But this hypothesis seems like a stretch. People go their entire lives doing things they don’t like. And its not even like I hate my current major, I actually really love it. Its just that deep down my life ambitions seem to be almost exclusively related to my true passions in the arts, even though I’ve never really had the opportunity to explore them properly. I’ve been daydreaming about them for as long as I can remember (probably since I was around 5). 

But I’m not naive. I know that a successful career in the arts is extremely rare and I already have a late start should I decide to pursue it now. Plus, my current major is extremely employable and I’m pretty good at it. Many people have advised I should secure a well-paying job first (which is essentially guaranteed with my current major) and then fund my actual passions with my day job. And this makes sense. But to be honest, I’m not sure if I even have it in me to power through anymore. With each month that passes, the crying fits seem to be getting worse. Its like a wave of emotions that comes back stronger each time. I’ve already uprooted my entire life twice before due to them and I don’t think I’ll be able to live if I continue burying these emotions. But I’m not sure if this just means I need to better manage my emotions, or if its a sign that I should actually pursue my ambitions or else risk losing myself (in terms of both my spirit/sense of self and my life) should I choose to continue ignoring them.

I recently started medical school and it’s been a big struggle to be ok with not knowing everything. I find myself not only getting frustrated at trivial things like not knowing the answer to a question (something others may not have even known), I start instantly tearing up. 

During these times, if I can’t control it, I’ll need to excuse myself to a bathroom or something to start full on crying. There’s been too many instances after class where I’ll just go cry in the bathroom, or get triggered by thinking others understand things better.

2022-11-01 12:24:57,Anxiety,"I've always had an anxious / overthinking mind. Certain scenarios are always stuck in the back of my mind until I finally decide to do something about them then a new scenario just takes over and I'm stuck being anxious again for months / years. 

An example is one day I would suddenly feel bad about bullying this kid in the past then I would keep obsessing over that until one day I decided to apologize to him and his response was that he was fine and he didn't care about it. Then after some time, I will start to think that I have treated my ex girlfriend quite badly and start to obsess over that thought for a few months until I finally decide to message her and say ""I'm sorry for treating you bad"" in which she replies with "" It's fine, no need to apologize"". 

For the last few months I've been anxious about this other scenario. This is that one time my dad asked me to help him share a file and I saw an app with a big red heart on it. He has cheated on my mum in the past so seeing this just got me thinking if he is using a dating app? Afterwards I went to search up all the dating app images to see if that picture matched with any of them so I can be sure if he was using a dating app or not but was unable to find any matches. He hasn't shown any other signs of cheating and is always home etc. So I was just thinking if I am overthinking again. 

I feel like If i do confront this issue and ask him if he's using a dating app and ""resolve"" this issue, another scenario will just pop up and replace it and I'll be stressed over another thing and the cycle of never-ending anxiety will continue. There are more examples of these scenarios but I have just named 3 for this post. These scenarios always take me a long time like months to confront with the targeted person, because maybe the logical part of my brain is fighting with the anxious part of my brain and telling me that I'm just overthinking and nothing needs to be done, but in the end the anxious part always wins.

When he first moved in and went over and asked him if he'd mind turning it down and he did but then still did it other times. Since then I've gotten 2 white noise machines and have tried to ignore it as much as possible (like on weekends and stuff) but tonight was super super loud so I just went over and had this convo:

Me: would you mind turning the bass down a little?

Him: (rudely) do you know what day it is?

Me: Yeah it's Monday

Him: it's Halloween

Then he slammed the door in my face when I was in the middle of a sentence. I emailed our HOA but now I'm feeling so anxious about that and just super anxious about seeing him around in general? I had a small panic attack immediately after when I got back to my place and now I feel nauseous just thinking about him, still listening to his heavy bass through the wall.

I have dealt with three pretty close deaths recently and I have been locked in grief, but at the same time I find myself afraid to sleep and unable to wind down while locked in existential panic.

Even when I was a child I have been terrified of death, but it fills my head so much recently that I can hardly think. I’m not afraid to say that I’m still very afraid not only of dying, but of what happens after. 

The permanence of the end and ceasing to exist are two things that really freak me out as well as actually slipping out of life into death.

2022-11-01 09:12:35,Anxiety,"Anxiety, agoraphobia, ptsd, or what?

I was diagnosed with generalised anxiety disorder recently after asking a doctor. 
I have had it all my life and it was mistaken for me being shy or awkward but as I grew I realised how bad it really was, especially when I moved out at 18.

 I had traumatic things happen to me that lead to be being even more anxious than usual. Sensitive to sound, avoiding human contact, having panic attacks every second and being on hyper alert etc I would argue it’s ptsd mixing with my already bad anxiety 

It’s gone up and down over time, it started being this bad at the start of 2022.

I got diagnosed september 2022.

I have realised it’s like this and worse now though. 
I got a kitten for emotional support and as I believed she has helped, I feel more relaxed in my own home. Before this I would have panic attacks if I heard a noise in the hallway. 
My boyfriend came to visit and even though I feel more confident usually when he’s with me as I feel safer and secure, I panicked whenever I was outside. I felt overstimulated and like my world was closing in on me, like I would faint.

This occurs whenever I go outside. I feel hot, sweaty, lightheaded. Might have chest pain and my heart will race. I would be shouting in my own mind to calm down to telling invisible demons to stop, or don’t let anything happen or just simply shouting “please” repetitively so nothing bad will happen and I’ll get through it. I often feel close to passing out.
I avoid going out or seeing ANYONE. I’m confined to my room. Meaning I can’t study either.

After I had a really bad roommate experience a couple years ago I’ve developed an intense fear of living with roommates. The experience made me feel like I was an awful person for taking up space in their home, despite them choosing to rent out to me, and would constantly be passive aggressive but never directly communicate. I’m autistic so this whole situation was very confusing and distressing since I didn’t know what I was doing wrong and it honestly felt like I was doing something wrong just for existing. 

My therapist says I’m probably being re-triggered by my last experience now and that I’m so used to being anxious and on edge constantly I subsconsciously seek it out. 

Now I am living with roommates again over 2 years later and even though they are nothing like my previous one, respectful and honestly mind their own business, I still feel similarly trapped and constantly feel guilty for being there and feel like I have to tiptoe, never make any noise or draw attention to myself. I just hide out in my room when I’m home as much as possible. I know this isn’t healthy but I’m literally afraid of them in case they tell me I’m being a terrible roommate or try and kick me out despite there being no evidence they want to do this.

2022-11-01 06:23:27,Anxiety,"Help!

I'm incredibly afraid of bumping into people of my past. This stems from the idea that they'll embarrass me in front of my partner.
I've changed a lot since school, I used to be very wild leading to a lot of embarrassing decisions.
Including sleeping with people and other sexually explicit things while under age.
I haven't told my partner about my past and try to hide it at all costs. I didn't speak to my family for years (we've recently began speaking again)  and I've moved away to the town my partner is from. One of my partners friends (we'll call him Dave) who I didn't like began getting close to someone I knew in school before my partner could meet the person from school I asked him to stop hanging out with Dave. I pretended the reason me not liking Dave were the reasons I didn't want them hanging out. 
In reality the reason was because he was hanging out with someone who went to my school and it was getting too close for comfort.

I've had a lot of trauma where I used to live, I think this and the embarrassment are the reasons I avoid the place.
My partner knows about the trauma but not the embarrassment.
I feel it's getting too far and I'll never escape it, I haven't found anyone who relates to this.
I feel like I'm being a bad person not telling him and lying to him but also feel the embarrassment is similar to trauma where I shouldn't have to tell people unless I feel comfortable. 
But avoiding the place where my family live in is increasingly more difficult and my attempts to move further away seem futile. 

Can someone please help give me some clarity.",HELP

2022-11-01 06:07:10,Anxiety,"Background, I'm 16 and in 11th grade. Have had issues since I was born, basically. Lotta meltdowns in elementary school when I would get too stressed and just shut down. I'm a lot better at managing these days. And as much as I hate it, a lot of times the anxiety, instead of just being a meltdown like when I was 8, comes out as more of like a really short temper. Cause I get really panicky inside until something sets me off, like it did today.

So it all starts with my batshit crazy Spanish teacher. Like, for the love of fuck, I have never had a single  other teacher who I haven't gotten along with as much as this one. I love clear rules and deadlines. Always have. She's the kind of teacher to mention something in passing one day and then expect it for a grade 3 days later. She once loudly cut me off midsentence because I didn't answer a class discussion question the way she wanted me to (you see the problem... it was meant to be free discussion). Just yesterday she expected me and a friend to bring an entire loaf of pan de muerto into class Wednesday for extra credit when all she specified for the project was to bake it. It's sweet bread and takes hours to make. Basically have to make it Sunday and that stuff only lasts like a week. 

Anyway, today I sorta hit my breaking point. She expected us to turn in a short writing thing she had up on the board last week when she had a sub cause she was gone. Nowhere did she mention it was due as homework. And I mean, I know I should have done it anyway, but the pileup of everything stupid she does just gets so frustrating. I have a B- in her class and an A in literally every other one purely because I never know what to do. Add in me being noticeable pissed off in class and rude to her a little because I was stupid and couldn't help myself. I know I shouldn't and I won't try to excuse that part. Guess I just truly realized I'm stuck with her for another 7 months. 

So I was really panicked inside, and the kicker came the following period when a packet I thought was due Tuesday, was actually due today. Crumpled the paper, threw it at the ground, and kicked a chair. Whole room went silent. Turns out the paper wasn't even graded. 

I hadn't done that shit since last year.",Had an incident at school for the first time in like a year.

Before I get a ""seek professional help"", I started therapy just two weeks ago. (Also, this is a throwaway account.)

Anyways, it's so frustrating and I don't know how to deal with it. Every day my brain finds something to be anxious about, and usually it doesn't make sense! I try to disregard them because it's literally not going to happen, but I don't know why.

It ranges from something like ""What if (X) secretly hates me?"" to something health related like ""What if I was pregnant?"" even though I didn't do the deed AT ALL! I feel so broken, and I don't know if I'll be okay ever again.  I don't know why this is happening to me.

My brother vaping indoors isn't helping either, because it makes me even more anxious. I already told him directly to stop but I can still smell it and it makes my head ache in worse cases. Sometimes I overthink about what if that vape had something illegal in it and I was second-hand inhaling it.

But now after 3 unsuccessful meeting with my girlfriend(long distance) I manage better. I still have my mind racing all day but it doesnt break me.

Do I need the validation?

Lately I feel so fucking lost and broken.  After a conversation with a doctor they diagnosed anxiety with not seeing the NPD, but admittedly I'm not completely honest with health workers.  I'm scared to be that vulnerable so who knows it I tried to hide my narcissism.

I was called manipulative, overly trauma dumping and sensitive.  I see the errors in how I acted with these friends and I think I feel bad for what happened.  I was a shitty friend to them and it hurts.

It was all water and bile because I already did number 2 before I got the anxiety attack. But what was worst was the last of my throw up was tiny blood. I immediately went to google and Reddit and everything and everywhere. All day I was nervous and full of anxiety. Crying because I thought I was going to die.

I don’t know if it’s normal because I haven’t thrown up since I was a kid. All because of my anxiety doing this to me. I drink to get away from anxiety only for it to come back and do more damage.

2022-10-31 12:50:32,Anxiety,"Hi. I am 23 years old and I am a gay man. I’m 6’3, and I have major anxiety issues. all my life I was bullied and discarded by most friends, and the one friend that I did have up until high school, always took advantage of me and was never really a true friend (she’s a Gemini by the way) 

My father was never really there for me, I maybe saw him once a month, and now it’s mostly once a year. My mom has always been there for me, but there’s always that underlying tone of homophobia that, for example, this allowed me to play with Barbies or play with nail polish, so I was constantly in denial of myself, not really knowing who I was.

I would say I know who I am and what I stand for, but anxiety ruins at all for me. I walk into a room and I think everybody’s looking at me. I tell myself it’s in my head, but my heart pumps like there’s no tomorrow, and I just can’t get the idea out of my head that everyone is judging me. I can’t say the things that I want to say, and I barely speak, because if I say some thing, I might be embarrassed. I Usually I’m really good at communicating and making friends one on one, but when it comes to a group of more than three, especially with  involved, there’s no luck for me. 


I struggle to ask simple questions to my boss, instructor. I have major bystander effect, even though in my mind, the person that I believe I am, will immediately help someone in need, but this ‘embarassment’ that I have literally takes over my life. 

And the thing that sucks the most is that I can’t share, or have normal conversations with my mom or my sister or my boyfriend, for some reason. I can’t figure it out, it’s almost like everything that I say is embarrassing, but I would have no problem sharing my deepest thoughts to a stranger that I just met, or a stranger on the Internet. Maybe it’s pride issues, trauma etc. I’m not sure but it is debilitating and extremely tiring.

I wish I could do a cart wheel in front of a stranger, I wish I could smile with my teeth to a stranger, I wish I could sing in front of a stranger (I’m a singer lol and have done live shows before, and usually only do amazing things like interact with the audience, when I’m high or drunk.)

I could take sertraline, I could do that. But I want to figure out another way to help myself. I’m tired of being afraid of the world and afraid of people, afraid of men, afraid of situations.

This goes much deeper than what I can describe in words. The embarrassment, let’s call it, is more than I think most people experience. It really controls my life to a point where I don’t know what to do, who I am, and how I can navigate in social situations, without being high or drunk.

Please help me, any advice or starting points would be wonderful.

For example, today I had a fashion show where I did two runs, where I’d walk back-and-forth on the red carpet with other models that I practiced with. Walking down the runway was one of the most scary experiences I’ve ever had. I know who I am, mostly, but I’m not confident. Every single thing was in my head, like oh that person is looking at me, oh I twisted my arm the wrong way so it looks weird, etc. etc. All of this while my heart rate is through the roof and I’m overheating. 

Some of these models are really really nice, but things like, me reading their facial expressions, which I use as a tactic when I was younger to dictate what I’d say to my angry parents or angry boys, overtakes me, and I end up saying.

2022-10-31 10:50:01,Anxiety,"To preface, I (22f) went through something pretty traumatic last year and where I thought I was dying. It turned out to be a mixture of post-covid syndrome, Vit D deficiency, and anxiety. But I felt like shit everyday. It turns out these ‘symptoms’ I was having, although very real, really were chalked up to some extreme anxiety/chronic panic. I have corrected the physical problems but mentally I’m suffering. I had my first episode of this ‘not feeling real/ questioning reality late last year Nov 2021. Over the last year I’ve tried different treatments.. low dose Xanax (which helps greatly) and Prozac (which helped at first but turned south really fast). 

After my Prozac was bumped from 10 to 20mg after relapse in symptoms everything got turned up 10 fold. I’ve been off it for a month now. I feel confused 24/7, my thoughts all blend together, my memory is fucking horrible. I don’t feel like myself anymore. I’m angry, irritable, I feel like I just want to start yelling at strangers and doing crazy things. I’m constantly on edge and have to stay busy or I get too in my head. The scariest thing though, I question my own sanity. I don’t feel connected to anyone, my voice is super quiet now I don’t have the energy to talk, when I’m in a busy place I question whether the things I’m hearing are real, and if what im seeing is real. I feel like im living in a different plane of reality and im close to going over the edge. Another thing is I really believe sometimes everyone hates me. I also grew up Christian and in a spiritual home so it’s hard for me to not think theres some ‘evil force’ around me sometimes. It just constantly feel like something  bad is about to happen and my life is going to end. 

I have a good life, my family has money, I have a decent job, nice car, nice home, amazing boyfriend and friends. I try to participate and maintain those relationships the best I can. But it’s hard when you constantly feel like you’re crazy or feel like on the brink of really losing it. I’m afraid I’m gonna start seeing  and hearing shit for real. And my mind is too clouded to convince myself otherwise. No mental clarity upstairs.

I’ll just write everything i’m feeling and hopefully you guys can help me out. Well for context I’ve always been an introvert, I never spoke in class, I was always the quiet kid in my friend group, I was always too shy to talk to girls, etc. So, I just graduated highschool a few months ago and ever since then, I haven’t felt the same. I’m constantly missing school, regretting not trying out for my basketball team even though I was really good, missing my friends so much, missing how simple life was. This year I’ve had a lot of trauma in my life that I won’t get into too much, but one that fucked me up a lot was my uncle passing away in April. Now the last time I think I was truly happy was December 2021, my favorite superhero is spiderman so the new movie had me extremely excited, the girl I had been wanting for all 4 years in highschool finally started hanging out with me (she ended up fucking my friend which left me feeling empty for a few months, I was really messed up in the head for a while), my family was in good health, me and my dad were hanging out a lot, everything was just good. Ever since then I feel like my life went downhill, I started smoking, drinking, partying, doing shit I wouldn’t normally do. I guess in a way I feel like it’s not me doing this, more so it’s just me trying to fit in to this new life. Anyways, what I really wanna ask you guys is this

Will life really get better? I’m traumatized from what this girl did to me, anytime I start talking to a new girl I lose interest because I can’t trust her, I also live my life in fear constantly because I’m always thinking someone in my family will die because my uncle died unexpectedly, I also really miss school because it was the only place where I would be distracted for a while. I’m in college now but it just isn’t the same, I miss my old life so much and I feel like i’m getting extremely sick.

2022-10-31 08:28:49,Anxiety,"I’m feeling so stuck and so lost. I (24F) have been dating my boyfriend (24M) for just under 2 years. I was actively seeking something casual when this relationship started, but eventually it progressed into a relationship because we had such a strong connection and he is such a wonderful human being. Throughout the relationship I have had many doubts pop up that eventually led to extreme relationship anxiety (is this the right relationship for me, am I attracted enough to him, is this what love is supposed to feel like, etc.). The first time this happened it lasted for about 3 weeks until I decided to talk to him about it. I told him I was doubting our relationship, feeling extremely anxious and didn’t know what to do. He was nothing but supportive and kind and said we could do whatever I needed to feel better. Immediately after that conversation I felt 100% better. But overtime the relationship anxiety crept back up. It’s unbearable. Almost every day I was waking up with an extremely heavy chest, heart racing, feeling like I had a fever, stomach pains, racing thoughts and lack of appetite. It has been so painful living like this for the past couple months. But because he is such a wonderful person, we have so much in common, the same values, same plans for the future, I narrowed it down to relationship anxiety and was committed to healing and working through whatever issues I was having within the relationship. I started going to one on one therapy, joined a group counselling program specifically targeting relationship anxiety, and continued communicating with him about the whole thing. But nothing has gotten better. I have my moments of hope that eventually I will feel okay in this relationship. And I still have moments where I really enjoy my time with him. But it’s just so much anxiety. It’s excruciating. I can’t even begin to describe how awful it feels. I can’t tell if the anxiety comes from a place of guilt? Or if the anxiety is coming from the fact that deep down I wanted to end the relationship but wasn’t admitting it to myself? Or if it’s because I’m not feeling how I think I should be feeling? I don’t know. The only really tangible part of my anxiety is that within this relationship, I’ve realized that I am bisexual. And it bothers me that I have never gotten the opportunity to explore my sexuality. 
I have a doctors appointment tomorrow to talk about anxiety medication. But I’m hesitant to take medication if the root of my anxiety is the relationship. Is it silly to consider medication before a break up? 
As of right now, I told him that I needed to take a step back. I asked him to give me a couple weeks to sort through my thoughts and figure out what I needed. I feel like I’m already leaning towards a break up being what I need, but I so badly don’t want that to be the solution. I can’t express how wonderful this man is. He truly deserves the world. And I know a break up would absolutely crush him. I really don’t want to hurt him. I’m feeling so guilty and already mourning this relationship. It’s the only healthy relationship I’ve ever had and I just can’t figure out why I don’t feel settled in it. We’ve only been on this “break” for 2 days and I miss him. But… I haven’t been feeling anxious. Not to the degree that I was before. Just really sad.
I love him and care about him so much, and I can’t figure if this anxiety is something I can continue working through or if it’s a sign that this isn’t the right relationship for me.

2022-10-31 08:07:30,Anxiety,"I struggle with daily life and it has only been getting worse and worse as time goes on. I’m diagnosed by my psychiatrist, therapist and a psychiatrist that works in the psychiatric hospital I was in. I’m diagnosed with schizophrenia, OCD, OCPD, Derealization Depersonalization Disorder, GAD, and Persistent Depressive Disorder. On top of all of that I’m also autistic. I have gotten better with some things here and there, especially with my OCD and my feelings towards my own self identity and self worth. My therapist is awesome and helps me a lot, even with resources that are available to me if I need them.

I often think of the past and how things for me were better. Since my mental health has kept declining over time. I want to enjoy life, and be happier, and do things I have always dreamt of doing like traveling, and doing things in life. Now I stay home all day, everyday. I sometimes go 8-16 days without food, I starve myself. Not because I don’t want to eat, but because my appetite is gone (especially during a psychotic episode where I become catatonic). Also my appetite is affected because I worry about contracting parasites from the food I eat, and then those parasites (like a tapeworm or something) traveling to my eyes and damage my vision permanently. I constantly am worried about my senses like my vision and hearing, but more so my vision.

How can I start enjoying life and being happy, and doing things in life I want to do? I worry about everything and it is ruining my life.

2022-10-31 07:37:42,Anxiety,"There is nothing in this world that terrifies me more than the thought of losing a close family member. The intense fear I have had when I'm in situations where I believe serious harm has come to them (whether it was a warranted belief or not) is debilitating and it feels like my world is crashing down around me. I'm also scared of what I would do if one of them did die, I don't think I could go on living because everything would remind me of them, but that's not the point of this, it's just to say how much it scares me for a little more context. 

My uncle passed away over the summer, and since then I have become terribly convinced that doing or not doing certain things will keep my family protected, or doing/not doing certain things will lead to harm. I'm not a religious person, I don't know if there's a God or anything, but I find myself praying every night just in case there is someone or something listening, and I pray for their safety, their good health, etc etc. I can only think of one night in the past nearly year where I haven't prayed, and it's because I was drunk and fell asleep. I beg for signs of some way I can help make sure my family stays safe, and I think this is the root of my issue now. 

My dad ended up in the ER 2 weeks ago. I woke up to him being taken by ambulance. He came back home later that day, I nearly fainted staring at the ambulance from my front door, my grandfather had to hold me up and walk me to a couch to sit down. Normally when I know I'm going to faint, I do something about it, I can recognize it and sit down. This happened when my uncle died, I was able to catch it and sit down before I collapsed (though I did still end up throwing up). But here I was so paralyzed, staring at the ambulance that my dad was in, so scared of never seeing him again. 

He's currently mostly stuck in bed as a result of what happened, the doctors aren't even 100% sure what caused it/what is currently causing the ongoing issues, but they believe it's nerve damage as a result of my dad writhing in extreme pain, and causing damage to himself. So he's on pain killers to manage it, and has been mostly resting in bed. This has resulted in me looking for anything I can do to possibly keep him safe. Anything I perceive as a sign that I should or shouldn't do XYZ to keep him safe, I will do/not do. Even if they make no sense. If the thought pops into my head that ""close the door a little. If you don't dad's going to end up diagnosed with something very bad, or worse."" I have to close the door just a little, until it feels arbitrarily right. There's random things I can't bring myself to do that only affect me, because right now the main thing is (and has been for the last 2 weeks) that I need to prove just how far I am willing to go to keep my family safe, how much I'm willing to sacrifice to prevent harm because I claim that I put them above myself, so if that's true, then I should be able to give up XYZ thing which gives me enjoyment/pleasure because they matter more than I do, and so I have been abiding by that, not doing certain things, like I've made a deal with God or the universe to prove it. 

I know this is ridiculous. I know it's not sensical. I know I should just do these things, and then I'll see nothing bad will happen, but the one thing I'm terrified of doing most I did the night before my uncle died, and the night before my dad was taken to the hospital, so it feels like if I do it, then something will happen again. And I know that even if I do that thing, and nothing bad happens the next day, if anything bad happens AT ALL in the coming days, or weeks, I won't be able to stop myself from attributing the bad thing happening to being a result of my actions, and blaming myself for it. I just don't know what to do. I'm in therapy, but my next session isn't until late November (I'm keeping an eye out for sooner openings, I just managed to move it from early December to the late November date, so with any luck I'll be able to grab a cancellation sooner, but it's hard with my college schedule). 

I don't really know what I'm asking for, I don't know if anyone can talk me out of this but if anyone can offer any help or support or advice I would really, really appreciate it.","How do I do things that I've convinced myself with cosmically lead to harm coming to family members?

I experience, what google very confidently describes as a heart attack, often. I’ll get chest tightness and pain, with numbness in some limbs, and shortness of breathe, occasionally with like nausea and vertigo. Truly debilitating. I’ve tried many meds, herbs, and just random vitamins but nothing ever seems to help. Both preventative or to reduce symptoms in the moment. The only thing I can do is lay down and ride it out for an hour or two. 
Obviously the fist few times it happened I was sure I was dying and went to the hospital. Every test they did came back fine. I would experience this multiple times a week, and sometimes a day, so the Dr ordered countless other tests. Every single one came back perfectly normal. 
All signs point to anxiety, and while I definitely had one moment within the last few years that was not great and catapulted my world into a new place, I’ve always felt my anxiety truly lies in how I don’t feel “good”. I feel like I’m dying a lot.. but the only solution seems to be just to ride it out and hope it doesn’t actually take. That clearly leads to more anxiety. 
So I guess my question is this.. wtf am I supposed to do about anxiety about my health, when my anxiety symptoms mimic catastrophic health issues.",New to the sub and looking for… well I guess another perspective? Maybe an answer if I’m lucky.

2022-10-30 14:44:22,Anxiety,"One of the things that really bothers me about my anxiety is that it is so difficult to talk about sometimes, not in terms of vulnerability, but rather just because I don't know which words to use.

I have such strange physical symptoms that I have no idea what to call them. If you have a symptom like sweating, it's easily understandable. But with some of them, it feels like there's no way to describe them because they're so odd, complex, or unfamiliar.

I get this one feeling that I guess you might call tension, but not like muscle tension. Like I just feel uneasy in my skin, and there's this weird ineffable energy about me. If you've ever taken stimulants, it's like the unusual, uncomfortable feeling you can get in your body when you're coming up. And it's always accompanied by the mental sense of being trapped, like I am claustrophobic about something which doesn't exist. There's a certain dread about it, though that's a very vague descriptor.

I feel like if I could better describe and understand these feelings that it would help me to address them better. And if nothing else, it's nice to have names for the things that happen during anxiety, because it makes it easier to relate to other people and realize you're not alone. You can look up ""anxiety sweaty palms"" and read thousands of examples of people who struggle with that. But no one really has any clue if their weird-energy-uneasy-uncomfortableness is the same as what I'm talking about.

Well I was googling to see if other people got this and then found out a ton of people were diagnosed with anxiety and panic disorder but were actually having partial seizures bc a symptom of a partial seizure is dissociation, dizziness, panic attack or strong sense of doom, and shaky legs or arms. I get all of this with panic attacks- so then I was looking to see how you can tell a difference and they’re like they’re basically the same thing- like sometimes a panic attack causes a seizure or sometimes a panic attack is a seizure. And now I’m crying and panicked because if that’s true I’m having tons of seizures a week and they’re saying like the symptoms are identical which is why a lot of them were misdiagnosed with panic disorder or attacks. I’m so scared I’m having seizures and am gonna die. And I wanna tell my doctor about it but I’ve already gone to him like 4 times in the past 2 months over other health anxiety stuff and I don’t think he’d take me seriously and I can’t go to a neurologist without a referral.

And we still occasionally text but we mostly just send stuff through Twitter, Instagram, and tiktok. I barely hangout with her since she hates coming to the city, she works, and I’m at school full time. 

During the summer we bought tickets for a concert and we both got tickets for our boyfriends too but then she told me he got a ticket for her friend. When the concert came around it felt awkward and they kind of left me and my boyfriend out. 

Tonight is Halloween weekend and I invited my friend over since my boyfriend is away and she hasn’t seen my new place but she said she was busy. And I see on her story she’s with the friend. Of course those plans were probably in advance but wow did it hurt.

31 and now also more recently diagnosed with OCD which explains the constant anxiety and being in constant fear. In the past the depression was more than the anxiety but now within the past 5-7 years it’s the anxiety which honestly makes it harder to live my daily life. 

I’d love to hear what others do to cope with anticipatory anxiety, or any advice is also welcomed. 

I am in therpy, and have been for over a year, I enjoy my therapist, but sometimes I don’t feel like I’m making any progress at all. It’s been a long time since I’ve seen a psychiatrist, I know I need to just get over it and see one I’m just not interested in spending all this money to find a medication that works when I would love not to be reliant on medication. Currently my primary care prescribes my mediation but I go through periods where I do it for a few months and stop because I don’t want to be on mediation and I’ve seen no improvements. I recently did just start on  Buspar again last week a very low dosage but I sort of feel it’s making me a little more anxious than normal. 

Lately I’ve been dealing with constant anxiety to the point my brain won’t turn off. Mostly it’s anxiety about Anticipatory things that are out of my control, living in fear of losing a family member suddenly, a car crash, or being at a store, or event, or theme park and there being a shooting or something. And some of those things come with me thinking if I choose the wrong date/time to go it will be my fault putting myself in that situation. Every single day I’m in fear having thinking about any longer drives we have coming up whether taking my dog to his physical therpy , or driving to my moms that’s 2 hours away, and a few cruises we have coming up I’m not anxious at all about cruise ships but the drives there, and the fear of what If something happens to a love one, or my dog and I can’t be there back home. I’d say the biggest is the driving one though, I prefer my fiancé to drive on our longer drives but I typically end up saying I’ll drive because I’m afraid if I make the wrong choice it’s a matter of a life or death car accident and I can’t shake that. I’ve never been in a car accident or lost someone in a car accident so I’m not sure where that new fear comes from I used to drive down to visit my family often but now if I decide to drive down there I’m thinking about it for days and weeks in advance. Just lately I can’t shake the feeling that something bad is about to happen , and my mind won’t stop thinking worst case scenario. 

Back in May my sister called me during work to tell me my uncle died, and it was suddenly and now I’m afraid of my phone. I’m constantly afraid that I’m going to get a phone call that something is wrong or someone is dead, I’m in constant fear about my mom, my dad, my sister, my dog, and fiancé. About a month after my uncle passed my mom was in the hospital for 2 weeks with multiple blood clots in her lungs and it terrified me. And she seems to be doing okay now but I’m still in fear I’ll get a call one day. So I know both of these are reasons why lately it’s so intense but it’s really gotten to the point I wish I could calm my mind down and not be in constant fear.

I say this because I'm sure that for some people anxiety is the cause of not liking those chaotic events and for me, it isn't (at least consciously, maybe subconsciously it is but that is a topic for another day). Even if I actively would avoid these chaotic events even if I had 0 anxiety, I feel like there can be some value in addressing this anxiety and getting it figured out. So I'm asking is it worth going through addressing it? Or would I just be better off not addressing it and only deal with that anxiety in the rare situations where I might be in those chaotic events (I can't really see when I would ever be forced into one of these chaotic events, but just saying). Thanks!",Is it okay/healthy to avoid certain situations?
2022-10-30 12:17:57,Anxiety,"It was a hostess/bussing/food running job at a restaurant.  I knew going into it that it would be challenging for me but I had been a server before (at a not very busy restaurant and I still found that very anxiety inducing) so I thought this would be an easier position even if the restaurant was busier.


I'm quite socially anxious (and I've long suspected I have Avoidant Personality Disorder) and find interacting with people (even people I know well) difficult.  So I naturally found just greeting/seating people a bit challenging, but other things I found challenging: answering the constantly ringing phone and talking to strangers/answering their questions I don't know the answers to, learning the software they use to manage the restaurant/reservations, the fact that they overbook the restaurant so people show up for their reservation and their table isn't ready so you just have to scramble to figure out somewhere to put them which begins a domino effect of messing up all of the other reservations, rude/impatient patrons who talk to you like you're a dumbass when you're just trying to be polite and learn the position.  Realistically I was probably doing much better than I'm making it sound, but I was just finding it so hard.  It was supposed to be a side job for extra money, but I didn't want it to be a thing where I'm anxious when I'm there and then anxious when I'm not there in anticipation of having to be there again, if that makes sense?



The other staff were generally nice and supportive, but I was still anxious asking them questions.  I'd been there six days and then last night was so overwhelmingly busy that I just came home and cried after the shift.  I've tried to force myself to do jobs interacting with people hoping that eventually I'll improve and it won't be such a struggle, but it never gets better.  I sent in my resignation today effective immediately and I can't be certain but I'm betting they're angry.  I just thought it was better to let them know sooner rather than later and not waste more of their time.  Now I'm just sitting with this feeling like they hate me and like my anxiety problems are insurmountable and will weigh me down all my life.

2022-10-30 11:46:28,Anxiety,"I always thought that my issues would be resolved if I had more friends, I been a loner since elementary school. Close friendships would come and go, each lasting around a year with a few lasting 3 years. But I always end up dropping them after constant arguing and a negative mindset that makes THEM out to be a bad guy. Even now, I’ve had a solid friend group for about 5 years (my longest ever) that my younger self would have dreamed to have but lately found myself repeating the same cycle. Why?

Because they were never the problem, I was. I’m not sure if I was so used to this cycle of gaining a new friend then leaving them, but I found myself struggling with commitment. And looking back, I was struggling back then too but didn’t truly understand why this was happening. I tried to take note these past few weeks on what makes me anxious and found that a lot of it revolves around my friendships. I panic when it comes to this idea of being a friend. Am I a good friend? Could I be better? What am I doing wrong? All this analyzing of who I am as a person to them and how they think of me is so damn exhausting. 

I also have an issue of comparing myself to others, especially to my friends. Started when I developed imposter syndrome in my major and never seemed to fully get rid of the obsessive behavior. A friendship that is based on competition and jealousy is never successful and I feel like I can’t fully break away from this cycle of thoughts unless I end it. I can’t keep up with the exceptions that are within a friendship. The pressure to hang out, talk to them, go all out and spend all sorts of money on gifts. This isn’t me. Because the entire time I just want to be in my room, alone, doing what I love. 

Is it really that bad to be alone? With no true friends? Society makes it seem that way, that my way of thinking isn’t normal. But I find true company in myself, I want to try new things, deeply connect with my hobbies and myself. Most importantly, spend more time with family and work on my mental health.",Setting myself up to be alone.. a vent?

I (28M) am currently freaking out. I met this really lovely girl at a concert on Sunday and we really hit it off. We’ve been texting pretty much every day since then, and I’ve decided I want to ask her on a date.

Some background about me - I’ve been in addiction recovery from alcoholism for over 2 years now and I also have Borderline Personality Disorder, and I’ve come a long way in regards to both. However, romance has eluded me in that time. I have not been on a date or intimate with someone without being completely fucked up in over 6 years. All of my romantic relationships in the past have been at best toxic, and at worst traumatic. I haven’t had feelings for anyone since I got sober. And now this silly little crush has gotten me feeling sick with anxiety, because it feels so foreign.

Honestly, whether she says yes or no, I feel like I’m going to freak out. This whole situation feels like a test, almost. Can I handle an incredibly triggering situation with grace and dignity no matter what the outcome is? I’m not one of those guys who is shitty and mean to people who reject him. But I do have a history of being incredibly self-destructive in response to rejection (drinking until I black out, binging and purging, cutting, and trying to hide it) And after two years of intensive therapy and working on myself I desperately want to think I’m a better person, but I haven’t faced a situation like this.

She is a very sweet person and we have a lot in common. If she just wanted to keep things platonic, I would be glad to be her friend. 

But I’m just afraid of this ugly monster that is still clawing at me. Regardless of the outcome, I haven’t been put into a situation like this in sobriety. And I have never been able to handle romantic feelings at any level in the past. But by that same token, I never will be able to handle them if I don’t try. Whether it’s the thought of her saying yes or no, it’s overwhelming.",Severe anxiety over asking someone out - but it isn’t about the fear of rejection

23 male 137 6ft

I remember having this when I was a younger kid, but basically after running around or doing some activity for a couple hours and I'd come home it would take maybe around like an hour for my heart to fully go back to resting rate?

I've also always had anxiety and a slight fear pf my heart beat and how hard or soft it is so maybe that has something to do with it? But recently I started obsessing's over my heart and I kept thinking about that... Today I was out for a while shopping and when I cam back home after moving the groceries it took maybe took like 30 mins to an hour to kinda calm down? I mean idk.

I just know that now its 70 and its been like an hour. It seems to always be like really sensitive after being out and like really reactive after? Its like it doesn't beat super fast but its really sensitive to when I stand up or something, more than if I were to be sedentary for a while.

I had an ecg which they said was heathy and the dr had no concerns. the only thing they found was signs for LHV but he explained it off as normal. Something about electrical misfire not within my heart but the way the machine reads it or something like that but no concern for my build and age.

I have also been kinda sedentary these past few years due to worsening depression and anxiety but still. I had this as a younger kid and I was very active back then.

Is it safe to assume this is normal for me? Whenever I google heart recovery it says some scary shit and how normal recovery should be just a few mins and no more than 10.

Like I said to reach like full stable resting it takes like an hour. It might be elevated from like 80-100 during that time. My resting is like mid 60s on a tired fatigued day and like 80 on a stressed day, but around 70s on an average day.",Worried about my heart recovery rate

I’m constantly terrified that I’m going to burn out or take too many drugs at once or fail. Sometimes I wonder if I wouldn’t be better off in a long term care facility. Other times I wonder if I actually have anxiety at all - maybe it was just a diagnosis made too early?

I noticed 1-2 of the side effects, but I don't feel less anxious. I am still just as worried and nervous as I was before. Still nervous enough where thinking about something can trigger a bowel movement I need to use bathroom. Still don't sleep well at night and can easily get nervous where I will not eat at all. (these two symptoms were what I wasn't able to solve with natural tries which was why I eventually tried meds). Because not being able to sleep/eat was affecting my life.

What I did notice, was a general 'uplift' mood. Like I could draw up a better mood without much difficulty. I wasn't sure if this was because things in my life were generally going well (as in if I didn't have meds would I still feel this based on what was happening) or the meds working. I feel like it didn't solve my symptom though. Being uplift didn't make me more pleasant with others and didn't solve the overthinking or anxiety.

I cannot let others see me as weak. It's my biggest fear. Above all else. I have plenty of other fears, but none that run as deep to the core. 

I physically cannot tolerate being thought of as needy. I recoil at the thought of pity. It's pretty bad.

I'd rather be seen jumping towards failure as if that were my intent than be seen fumbling at an attempt at success.

I don't know how to change this. And unlike a lot of other things, I don't know if I can fully convince myself to want to change it. Something about allowing people to see me as weak feels wrong on an instinctual level.

I mean I can vent on hear, talk about all my fears and insecurities. I am perfectly fine anxietyposting a bunch of bs while I'm panicking. But that's only because it's anonymous.

I can think of a list of, relatively normal feelings, that I've locked so deeply away that I've never discussed them with anyone, not even my closest friends. Not my family. Or if I do, not with any sincerity.

It feels like I'm not ""allowed"" to have these feelings. Or it would be wrong if I did. Namely wanting a close friendship or wanting a relationship. It's like I'm ashamed of wanting those things. Wanting those things makes me weak. But I do.

Maybe because it opens me up to rejections and I'm afraid of that? But I don't know. It's more the fact that they'd know I wanted something closer. They'd know I had those feelings that I'm not allowed to have.

Maybe that's what fear of rejection is and I'm just overthinking it. I know I'm allowed to have those feelings, it just doesn't feel like it.

Unbeknownst to me, back at my SO's family house where I was spending the night, there was a street parade, so finding parking was hard. On top of that, his extended family was over that I hadn't met yet. I quickly went to my SO's room and haven't left since. 

So badly I'd love to introduce myself, be a socialite and just have fun. But instead I'm sitting here in tears, unable to even bring myself to use the bathroom.

You know when the sound of the clock chimes in and it feels like this existential dread, like the walls are caving in. That's how it feels all the time.

I'm not even sure what I'm asking for as I get to the end of this. I just can't seem to run away from this feeling that every moment I create; every conversation, every look, every thought is wrong or I'm wrong.

I started noticing them 2 days ago. At first it was just 1 - 2, or so I thought. But today I must’ve killed around 13, and there’s still 1 that I noticed but couldn’t quite catch. I have a bathroom attached to my room, so maybe it’s because of the moisture? But I don’t think so because how come they only come now, I mean, my bathroom has always had moisture. Even in the summer time, I didn’t get this many flies. This is absurd. 

I have quite a bit of mould in my bathroom, could that be the issue? It’s black stuff in the corners of my shower wall. I’ve tried cleaning it but I guess you can’t wipe away mould.

2022-10-30 08:19:30,Anxiety,"I’m not sure if this is the right place for this, but I have not felt the same since getting vaccinated and I have been dealing with this for a full year now and have not found relief. Let me explain:

I got my first Pfizer vaccine October 28, 2021. The shot was okay. I did start feeling very dizzy afterwards which was strange because that has never happened to me from a shot of flu vaccine. It worries me a little bit, but after 30 minutes of sitting at the Walmart where I got the vaccine I was eventually able to drive my way back to work. Between that time and getting my second dose of the vaccine I started to get tightness in my chest. It wasn’t a constant feeling, but it would come and go at random times and I could not control it. I ended up getting my second dose anyways. This time after the shot I was dizzy for a full hour but it eventually subsided and I was able to return to work. That night I started having shortness of breath and difficulty breathing as I was laying down for bed. For some reason I did not have this issue as noticeable while sitting up. I was unable to go to work the next day as I was feeling very sick. I ended up getting a doctor appointment just to check if everything was ok. Doctor said I am young and healthy and there is no cause for concern. Over the next few day I started to have episodes of feeling like I was barely holding on to my consciousness. That’s the only way I think I can describe it. I went to the movie theater but started having one of these episodes, so I left near the beginning of the movie to drive to my parents house (they are only 30min away) on my drive home I was trying to do breathing techniques in the car, but ended up hyperventilating (this had never happened to me before so I had no idea what was going on) my body started to tingle and I was loosing the function of my arms. I pulled over and badly parked the car. At this point my fists were clenched (I was unable to move my arms) and my face muscles tightened up. I thought I was having a heart attack. I asked someone for help to call 911 for me “I think I’m having a heart attack” I said to them. An ambulance came as I was starting to calm down. Finally re-gaining motion in my arms and face muscles felt relaxed again. They checked me out and ended up attributing this episode to anxiety. I did not end up going to the hospital. I finished the drive to my parents place and scheduled another doctor appointment. Did a full physical and everything was ok. Went to a neurologist after that and had an echocardiogram and a brain MRI. The only thing that came back from that was a minor mitral valve regurgitation. The doctors were not concerned about this. After this I just tried to move on as if nothing happened, but I went to dinner with friends and was unable to be myself I had to excuse the table and go to the bathroom to try and compose myself. I went to the movies again and I made it through the film but felt miserable the entire time (I was constantly focused on my breath and felt like I was going to pass out). I’ve since been on planes and have the same miserable feeling there. Even while driving I would start to uncontrollably shake usually until I got to my destination. I saw a psychiatrist who immediately prescribed me antidepressants and beta blockers. I had never been to a psychiatrist before and this was odd to me and I ended up not taking the medication because I just wanted to figure out what was wrong. Talking for 30min and then being prescribed that kind of medication felt odd to me. Anyways since then I have started feeling like I am slowly getting better, but still have episodes here and there. Sometimes in public environments and sometimes while I’m home alone. I’ve started getting constant heart palpitations. My heard pounds and pounds and pounds constantly. Even in “relaxing environments” and I constantly get minor pains in my left arm/shoulder/armpit. I have no idea what is going on. I constantly think I might die.

2022-10-30 07:43:20,Anxiety,"Hello, I'm writing this to see if anyone is experiencing something similar, and if anyone has any tips on how to live with it. When I was 16-17 years old, for about 3/4 of a year I'd wake up anxious and nauseous, pretty much immediately as I opened my eyes in the morning. It's a struggle most of the time because I'm just vomitting up stomach acid and bile, and sometimes I feel relief after the first time I vomit, but sometimes it carries on for a few hours, where I'd vomit multiple times. I'd even try to drink water to help bring it up, and sometimes if I'm just anxious and nauseous I might force it because it brings me relief. I think the two main reasons were high school, and my ex-boyfriend I was with at the time. The first of these vomitting episodes happened when we were fighting, and he was throwing furniture around loudly, and I was having a panic attack that caused me to vomit. And then it was every morning after that.

&amp;#x200B;

I've seen the doctors about it back then, my first doctor just straight up said it's anxiety and gave me valium (16-17 btw. what the fuck). After a few months of it not getting better, I visited a different doctor who said we have to rule everything else out first, and referred me to get an ultrasound and a gastroscopy. Nothing was found. The gastroscopy happened around the time I broke up with my ex, and soon after it just went away for years. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm now 22, and the same thing is happening to me again. It started around July-August when I went back to studying, so I think it might be related to that.

2022-10-30 07:03:10,Anxiety,"I will never forget the day i had it, i was on a train heading to school. A early routine i did 5 days a week, trainride was about 6 minutes. About 2 minutes in i started to feel my heart racing, intens tunnelvision and hyperventelating.

Me who never had experience this was in short words afraid. 

The attack lasted until i got off the train, then i felt i had never experience such great breathing before.

A couple of weeks went and i was afraid of taking the train again, since thats where it happend.

It took me about a month or soo before i went on it again, but the day i decided to try to get on it even when i felt the panic come on was a ride of relife.

I had all the symptomes but i felt a calm in them as if i had neglected the present moment for a long time.

 As if the trainride was not scary to begin with the train had to stop, there was no way to get off the train. This did increase the symptomes yet i realised that if i were to always avoid the present moment i would suffer. 

Fast forward to this present moment as i write this post, my first post. 

Now this is around 8 years ago, and i have had soo much anxiety since,but i dont fight it or try to avoid it by any means.

When i feel alot of anxiety building up there is 3 thoughts i get and live by.

1. Acknowledge i have or having a panic attack.
2. I know for a fact that my body will produce alot of adrenalin which causes all the symptomes which is uncomfortable.
3. Our bodies cant keep this state of adrenaline for more then around 40 minutes +/-, i know i cant think straight and i am feeling a fog over me. And this i accept for the set amount of time, and it's fine i dont judge it.

I'v come to love the present moment regardless on how it is, cause it's the only thing i ever have and will have. And the present moment is no thoughts just alertness.

This is what my panic attack lead me too, a more present life. 

No longer do i neglect my wishes, feelings and thoughts, dreams and overall life.

It made me more aware and able to act, and I couldnt be more happy for it.

Now this is how i live with it, cause there is NO way we cant live without anxiety, it makes us able to act.

Now i know that might sound like a bummer, cause a panic attack is not the best of feelings. 

I hope this post may contribute to some of you as a perspective on anxiety in general, indulge into the anxiety more then tempting to avoid it.

It is easier said then done, this i know, i speak only of alot of experince and knowledge.

Wish you all the best!",My first panic attack was the best thing to ever happen to me.

Having a hard time?

I MISSED a ton of school during my education years, and fell behind rather quickly and I was missing so I wasn't there to get the material so was placed on an IEP. I was in normal classes it's just some of them had a para in the room. I wasn't diagnosed with anything I wasn't in where the autistic kids were. But am I intellectually impaired? Or is it my ADD. Don't you think by 25 they would've caught something if it was there?

I do have my CNA, I currently am employed at the hospital working on the med/surg floor and everyone says how good of a job I do. Am I just underestimating myself? Would missing school cause me to fall behind? Thats why my mom said they stuck me in those classes I mean some. English I was super good at, math and science I struggled a bit in. Could've been due to missing school too. I'm just really struggling, I'm 25 like I said and I only have been diagnosed with ADD. My oldest sister actually was in those classes also. She's got ADHD. Our whole family has ADD(HD). 

I just need advice here. This is my last resort. I see a therapist and she's saying it's anxiety but I'm not sure. She said I'd have to be average intellegience to pass that CNA.

I was surprised I passed my CNA boards lol. I know in HS I didn't really take highschool seriously. I didn't really study, I just hated school. But now I wish I could go back and re do it to see if I really am just being hard on myself or overthinking.

I don't have a job, no car and no girlfriend and he ridiculed me over it all. Him doing that on top of feeling lonely pushed me into making dumb mistakes like clicking on links you don't know and then actually adding someone who I don't know on snapchat who turned out to be a scammer all-along and giving the scammer money on their fake dating website (which I've learned is a common scam now and I now know not to fall for it again because of this and they were really phishing for my credit card info, which thankfully I did not give them, but I still fell for the scam using the last remaining amount on a visa gift card which was 10$) and then months after I fell for the ""pin"" code scam because I accepted this random person's message request on twitter and they turned out to be a scammer which I didn't know they were until after I fell for the scam too. I unknowingly did not know that you shouldn't ever share any pin codes with anyone last September and I learned this the hard way, they tried setting up accounts using my phone number on a dating app and luckily they did not succeed, I know this because the dating app company emailed me they couldn't find any accounts tied to my phone number. I unfortunately gave that twitter scammer my phone number and email too. I had no idea these people were scammers during the time, but I do now and I always wish I had common sense back then because none of this would have happened. 

However, I have lots and lots of common sense now and it's okay to ask questions if I think something doesn't feel right. I should have questioned myself last year and asked questions like this, ""what if I add this person on snapchat and it turns out they aren't who they say they are on tinder?"", ""what happens if I click on this link and they ask for personal or financial information?"" or ""what happens if I accept this random message request from someone who I clearly don't know and what rabbit hole will I be drug into?"" Common sense questions like these are questions I know now to always ask, I just wish I asked questions like these last year. I'm able to answer these questions now and I'm able to avoid adding strangers onto social media from some dating app now because I have the assumptions now that they're scammers if they want to swap to another platform because it could be for any reason and I never want to find out again and I assume now their scammers if and when they send me message requests on any social media app when I don't know them.

2022-10-29 14:49:27,Anxiety,"My mind is racing and I’m nervous about starting a new medication. Looking for some reassurance.

Health anxiety has been kicking my ass to the point of having a breakdown a few days ago. I caved and made an appointment with my primary. I mentioned my history with SSRIs; I do okay on them but eventually start feeling less like myself, more like a zombie. Also, the side effects that come with starting them and weaning off them only makes my anxiety worse. She recommended hydroxyzine or buspar and we ended up deciding on buspar. She is starting me on 5mg daily. I’m wondering if this was the ideal choice. I didn’t want to have to take medication daily again, but here I am. 

With SSRIs in the past, when I started taking them, I start feeling brain fog and zaps, dizziness, fatigue. Should I expect similarities with an anxiolytic? Has anyone experienced better results with this type of medication compared to an SSRI? Also, if anyone has took hydroxyzine as well, did that work out better for you?

I also will be going back to therapy.",Prescribed Buspar

2022-10-29 14:36:50,Anxiety,"\*I posted this in a different subreddit but also want to post it here\*

So, in the past year I started noticing that when I thought of something I said or did in the recent past that I was embarrassed, ashamed or guilty about - typically in relation to people I wanted to impress or make a good impression on - my mind would compulsively say ""I want to kill myself"" and ""I want to die"". Even though I don't actually want to do so. As time progressed, it stopped just being in my head, and I've started saying it out loud, often times repeatedly, multiple times in a row. And sometimes in conjunction with the phrase ""I want to murder my body"".

Let me repeat - I absolutely do not want to kill myself. I am someone who tries to practise mindfulness and presence, I believe we are all souls on this earth here to experience and learn through the ""good and bad"" times, that ""good and bad"" are labels we put on experiences. That one must ride the wave and go with the flow of life.

I'm not scared of these compulsive, suicidal thoughts necessarily - but it is becoming annoying. I don't like that I feel like I have no control over it, the words literally just come out of my mouth when my mind wanders to something I did, or said to someone recently. (Like tonight, I sent a text to a crush that was very forward and he didn't respond, which sent me off). I feel like it has become a coping mechanism for my brain, when feeling anxiety about past actions/decisions I've made.

It's gotten to the point where, even when I'm around other people ""I want to kill myself, I want to die"" slips out, low under my breath. No one has heard it so far, but I'm actually scared that I'll say it out loud. It's normal for human minds to be thinking constantly, which is toxic, but I think it's a different ball game when those thoughts are being spoken out loud. And even more so when it's involuntary.

Does anyone know wtf is going on or have any advice? Honestly just feels good typing it all out, I've been pondering it myself for some time but never layed it all out like this. Of course talking to therapist/counsellor would be a great call, I just...don't want to go through the ordeal of finding someone, though I know that's not a good reason not to.","Compulsive ""bad"" thoughts turning vocal"

Between the back entrance of work to where I get on the highway to go home I pass through seven intersections with traffic lights on the same road and the first five are all in succession close enough together that you can easily see the next four in the distance simultaneously after going through the first one because it’s a busy commercial district road with lots of shopping plazas/stores.

After going through the first three lights just fine I was approaching the fourth light when it suddenly turned yellow and in a moment of panic due to my distance from the light and driving speed I ended up speeding up and driving right through the intersection when I should’ve stopped and braked like the two trucks in the right hand lane beside me did so I ended up blowing a red light as a result and while no one in the opposite direction had gone yet it was definitely green for them.

I guess I panicked and forgot how fast of a yellow light that particular intersection had so I initially thought I had more time than I did and completely lost it when I realized I’d driven myself through a red light due to indecision and as bad as my anxiety has been sometimes I’ve thankfully not had too much trouble with it interfering with my driving in the last 22 years but that definitely scared me and I hope I never do it again!

Maybe it's just a trick of the mind, but somehow, that measly 7 minutes was enough for me to finally not have any anxieties tonight.

So basically I take 100mg of Wellbutrin in the morning (I'm tapering off since it's making my anxiety WORSE) and today for breakfast I had eggs and bEANS. But then... The horrible decision: COFFEE

there was nothing else to drink, and water and eggs and beans is a no go

Downed it (with milk ofc) and ate, then started my day


Immediately felt it an hour after. Was with my mom on an errand, felt the all too familiar ""Holy fuck this panic attack is AWFUL"" PA. The literal worst I had in 2 years, but I managed to fight it so well that I'm impressed. I didn't freak out too much, it was the physical symptoms that fucked me over. Pins and needles everything, breathing, lightheadedness and dizziness and feeling like I was gonna pass out. Mind you I had avoided coffees for the past couple years, so suddenly drinking a whole mug was not the best idea-

Had to spend all day deep breathing, relaxing, calming music, freaking tf out but hiding it from everyone since my dad got admitted to the hospital for a horrible kidney stone pain (he's fine, just needs to pass it) 

Spent hours in the hospital. So here's my timeline:

11:50am : THE DEADLY MUG O' JOE
12:00-1:00pm: the PANIC AND PINS
3:00pm: hospital time and anxiety 
4:00pm-9:00pm: downtime, starting to calm down :')
9:00pm-Now: another anxiety and restless spike, feeling like I couldn't sit and just was awful


Is coffee able to re-spike after a couple hours? Or is that my anxiety fucking me over? Also I hardly ate since the morning until maybe 7:00pm when I asked for a sammy and juice from the hospital staff

About a week later on Friday I started feeling significantly more anxious, woke up sweating (I usually don't sweat much) hands shaking, heart pounding, BP through the roof.

I thought it was just a bad anxiety attack and called the after hours line saturday, they said to go to urgent care or the ER, I couldn't either day due to work and my mom moving on Monday (worst day of my life)

Tuesday it was still going, I had gotten rid of the stresser so the panic should have been gone, but it was worse so I went to urgent care and they sent me to the ER, I told them I had just upped my dose of celexa and based on my research it seemed like a bad side effect (I was shaking dramatically and sobbing all day)

The ER gave me a Valium and sent me home saying it was a panic attack, and told me not to stop taking the celexa. 

I finally got in to see my nurse practitioner wednesday and she immediately believed me and gave me a BIG shot of benedryl and told me to stop the medication cold turkey.

My psychiatrist finally got back to me and told me to do the same.

It's now Friday and I'm still a nervous wreck, I'm still shaking and sweating involuntarily, and I believe what I had was seritonin syndrome, however all the sources I can find say the symptoms should be gone by 24-72 hours and it's almost been that long and they're still going.

2022-10-29 10:28:40,Anxiety,"Hey. So I've mostly overcome my anxiety. But today, I'm getting some and have no idea why.

This year, I beat my depression, bought a Six Flags Magic Mountain pass, and went there 7 times this Summer - riding every major thrill ride in the park. I had zero fear of roller coasters. I also have proficient engineering knowledge, so logically, I'm very keenly aware of how redundantly safe roller coasters are built, constructed with high safety factors and computerized block sections to make them safe - and statistically speaking, the risk of a roller coaster accident is 1,000,000 times less than that of a car accident.

But for some reason, I've been having some random fears that the coasters I'm on will crash. Specifically two of them, which, ironically, have never had any incidents in their entire history.

I'm also afraid of drunk drivers, since the park closes at 1AM and it's the weekend before Halloween. And I'm also afraid of driving tired and crashing my car, since I usually wake up at 6-8am nowadays.

2022-10-29 09:53:49,Anxiety,"23 male, 5ft 11, 137 lbs.

So I was a very active kid growing up. Didn't do much sports but I was always running, swimming, or riding around on bikes and such.

Over the years I kept getting more and more sedentary. 

Around 2015 I started getting depressed and bad brain fog and I would spend less time outside. I still had highschool so I was mostly moving for half the day, and some days I'd go outside but it was less.

I think it started getting bad in like 2017-2018 when college started and most of my friends either moved or were too busy so I was going out even less. I had like 3-4 hours of college and would come home and just spend the entire day in front of the tv or computer. Sometimes I'd go outside for a quick 30 min longboard ride but that was it. 

When covid started I was fully indoors. pretty much from day to night I was on my pc. so like all of 2020.

in the summer of 2021 I kinda started going out. Not really doing any exercise but I at least started going to stores and stuff like that.

Then around 2022 the anxiety and depression and panic attacks were getting unbearable so I started walking 1-2 hours a day for a couple of weeks and then I went to the gym to lift for 1 month. 

THEN in the summer of 2022 I got hit with even worse anxiety and it centered around my heart. I've always had some heart anxiety, even when I was in like the 1st grade I kept worrying thinkin my heart was beating too fast or I was gonna die from something. But this was super bad. I was obsessed over my heart rate and beat and how it fluctuated thought the day and any ""activity"" I'd do. 

I stopped doing anything active. I was scared of bringing my heart rate up. I even went to the ER and had a dr check me out and do an ecg/ekg and I was deemed healthy and he had no concerns for my heart. SO thats good. But the fear and anxiety stayed. its been about 5 months since the heart fear peaked and im a lot better and my symptoms mostly went away but I still too scared to start working out. And now I've been looking up a bunch of articles about sedentary life styles and im scared I've fucked myself...

Im very skinny and weak but I've been that way my entire life. I've always struggled to put on weight and muscles, my cardio was never super good either despite being outside all day as a kid. I was just never a long distance runner, more of a burst sprinter kinda guy. 

But yeah. I keep thinking back to how I hiked up Mt Rainier in like 2017-2018. It wasn't the full mountain, maybe just a quarter but the entire hike going up and coming down lasted the entire day. All I can think is HOW did I manage without having a full breakdown. Like I said, Im very sensitive to my heart rate. Always have been but never THIS bad. And I cant imagine doing that in this state. Im scared what if my life style really did ruin my heart, despite the drs telling me physically im fine, its anxiety, and some people others online telling me im fine.",How bad is a sedentary life style and is it possible to fix it?

2022-10-29 09:25:08,Anxiety,"Hello! I've been having some real struggles especially with health anxiety and contamination anxiety. When I've been anxious for a while, sometimes its hard to read my body's signals, one of those being my body's temperature control.

When I'm cold, I don't recognize it first as being cold, I recognize it first as anxious symptoms. I might feel anxious and don't know why, tense, chills, headache, etc. Then I start spiraling. When I am hot, I may think I am anxious because I'm sweaty, nauseous, short of breath, etc. Again, spiral.

So here is a possibly useful tip if your anxiety also detaches your mind and body signals a bit!

* Question what environmental factors could be affecting your body
* Try a temperature control solution, like cold water to your face or against your wrists, or a nice hot beverage or heating pad

In the last few months, out of nowhere I've noticed that I randomly get overwhelmingly sad for a short period of time and snap out of it quickly. This ended up causing me a lot of anxiety (I'd ruminate about if i was depressed, bipolar, etc.) and just made everything worse. 

I'm noticing very recently that its happening a lot more often because I'm thinking about it more. I'll be totally fine and then think to myself, what if i get sad? What if that sadness never goes away? And it'll send me spiraling for a short time. What's worrying me is when I do snap out of it, I feel totally normal, but then a small positive event may make me irrationally excited to the point of being nervous again. It doesn't help that I then get irrationally nervous that I'm bipolar.

2022-10-29 08:33:26,Anxiety,"Hey guys so around this time last year I (17 F) had gotten sick and thought it was a bug but months later i was still sick, so in the beginning of January the doctors started to treat me for stress ulcers. I was going through a pretty traumatic experience at the time and I've always had anxiety and depression so it wasn't a surprise to me. It very much affected my life I threw up constantly, had heartburn, headaches, panic attacks, you name it I had it all. For me the hardest symptom to deal with, which I still have even now, is  a weird feeling that's an extreme version of what having low blood sugar feels like. It will come in waves where all of a sudden I feel like I'm going to pass out and throw up and five minutes later I'll feel fine and then five minutes later it's back. To elaborate, my anxiety makes it hard for me to eat, I went from snacking all the time to being food repulsed. I don't have an eating disorder in the way that i'm not trying to lose weight or anything I am happy with my body. But I can't even eat my favorite foods anymore and if I do eat it isn't very much. The nausea and everything got to the point I had to switch into online school for 1/2 the year, which helped with the panic attacks but i still felt sick all the time. Over the summer I thought I recovered enough to go back to school, so I decided to go back to school for my senior year, but as soon as i got to school the everyday panic attacks came back followed by the throwing up and everything. It is super hard because the most minor inconvenience sets me off. Yesterday in the middle of an argument with a ""friend"" I puked a lot and we were at school, the argument was she told me she only was friends with me because she felt bad i had anxiety. I hate that I still feel this way, I have a happy life but I feel miserable. I have a very supporting  group of friends and family, I have seen both of my parents cry in the past year because they feel bad for me which just makes me feel worse. I was on 20 mg of Lexapro but for some reason they made me switch cold turkey to 37.5 mg of Effexor in August. I also have therapy weekly, and I love my therapist. I've gone to sooo many specialists and psychologists. I feel like I've tried everything but it's just getting worse again.  My childhood dog just passed, and a lot of people at my school are being awful right now, the girl said she felt bad for me was my date for hoco so we were close as something more then friends but not quiet together. But she told me a lot of people don't like me and even though I genuinely don't care if I'm liked but its still hard to hear and now I just feel lost. I told my parents about it but I really don't want to go back to the doctor just for them to try and change my medicine, or tell me to box breath, or drink ginger tea. And I mentally cannot take it if my family starts to cry again. And I am NOT going to a psych ward or anything similar to that. I don't SH in the typical form, I slam my head into the wall and am reckless with driving even though I hate it, and I have a hard time with substances I feel like I have 0 self control.

2022-10-29 07:35:03,Anxiety,"Hello folks,

just created an account to share my story. English is not my my first language, so please bear with me.

I hope this post will help some of you, who are suffering from anxiety or panic attacks.

Everything began with an initial panic attack due to severe stress.

Horrible lifestyle (poor diet, horrible sleeping routine, lack of exercise) + mental stress let to this point in my life.

After suffering from this initial panic attack my life changed to the worse.I thought ""just sleep a night on it and everything will be fine""...oh boy, was i wrong...

I developed a severe Emetophobia (fear of throwing up) and panic disorder.

The first years i arranged my life to ""live with it"" and kinda lost myself in a victim mentality.

""Poor me.""

""Why is this happening to me?""

At this time, i didnt know, that i f\*cked myself over with this kind of mentality, but we get to that later ;)

Fast forward // \~5 years into the disorder i lived through the most horrific panic attack while going to the cinema with my girlfriend. The world around me was spinning and i couldn't move for what felt an eternity.

After this incident, my mental and physical health were spiraling down rapidly. I lost 15Kg in 3 1/2 month...couldn't eat, couldn't sleep, couldn't even leave my house without having severe panic attacks.

I thought that it is over...the only future i had, was in a mental asylum on forced medication.

Lucky me, having a girlfriend with a (let's call it) ""drill instructor mentality"" (russian pragmatism i guess), she forced my into deep self-reflection and CHANGE.

Without her, i would be dead...

Quick note: I've always have been a person with a severe authority problem. So doctors, therapy and medication were never a real option for me...even on the brink of death (maybe i am dramatizing, but it sure felt like it).

So i took my healing into my own hands!

I read a heap of books, watched alot of videos and tried alot of things/methods. I will link the (imo) most important sources at the end of this text.

BUT LET'S CUT TO THE CHASE!

The most important tools on my journey were:

\* The Chill Pill (a must have)

\* Mindfulness / Meditation

\* Acceptance

\* A healthy, NATURAL lifestyle

\* Spirituality

Let me elaborate on those points:

Mindfulness / Meditation

A big part of anxiety lives from judging our own thoughts. And most of the time, these thoughts are about the past or the future...in case of anxiety the ""future thoughts"" are the BIG PLAYER.Because when we over and over think about things, that COULD happen, we are forcing our body into fight or flight mode (ANXIETY).

Thats how our brains work and should work: It should protect us from a possible threat. And the brain does not differentiate between a ""real"" threat and a ""fantasy"".

The moment we judge the thought, identify with it and are conviced that this is the truth, it's a ""real"" threat to the brain. And when there is a threat, there is anxiety. A normal reaction.

The problem is not the anxiety or the thought. It's the judgement of this thoughts / symptoms and the identification with it.

We have to see thoughts as what they really are: JUST THOUGHTS.

There is nothing like a negative or positive thought. This is just something we tell ourselves based on the content of the thought.

Also, there is nothing like a negative or positive feeling. It's just a story we tell about the feeling.

Feelings are just bodily sensations!

The big problem with anxiety (discorder) is: When we see anxiety as something negative, we force a stress reaction, that causes more anxiety. So if anxiety itself is relying on stress hormones and we force new stress hormones into our blood stream by judging a stress-induced feeling...we keep ourselves prisoner in this loop.

As soon as we drop the judgment, the thoughts and feelings have no more power to cause a stress-reaction and anxiety.

The tool to reach this state of observation without judging, is mindfulness.

I started with the HEADSPACE APP to learn the basics and started with silent sitting meditation soon after. This is where the real magic happens...when you are alone with yourself, in silence, ""looking"" at your thoughts and feelings.

Mindfulness is (imo) mandatory for the second tool: ACCEPTANCE.

As Carl Jung wrote: ""What you resist, persists.""

This is a key element for overcoming anxiety. If you hate your anxiety and resist it with every part of your body and soul, it won't go away. Not only that...it will grow!

Just imagine your feelings like a river. As long as it can flow freely, there is no problem. But what happens, when you build a dam? The dam collects the water at a particular place...the water rises...the pressure rises. And that's exactly what happens with anxiety. When you push it away and resist it, it will get bigger and the ""mental pressure"" rises.

YOU HAVE TO LET IT FLOW!

And to let it flow, you have to let go of your judgement about your thougts and about anxiety itself.Every negative judgement is a resistance that keeps you stuck in your anxiety.

Negative judgements are not only mental...a big part is language.

How you speak ABOUT your anxiety, makes the difference, if you can get rid of your suffering or not.

If you say something like ""My anxiety is bad / horrible / gruesome."", you are sending a signal to your subconscious mind, which will manipulate you behaviour in a way, in which you are starting to sabotage yourself.

And this is part of the victim mentality. As long as you see yourself as a victim of external circumstances, you can't change anything.

Why would you change something if you believe, that:

1. there is no way out

2. It's not your responsibility

You have to take control of your health and your live in general.

YOU have to change. YOU have to call the shots!Nobody can do that for you.

Yes, you can get external Input, but YOU have to take the action.

But lets come to the most underrated topic, when it comes to anxiety.

Anxiety is not a mere mental construct. Anxiety can also happen on a physical base, without any mental factor.

A good example is caffeine. Caffeine will force your body into fight or flight mode, without any mental mechanism behind it.

Some other factors that play in the same league:

Low blood sugar

Where there is low blood sugar, there is CORTISOL. Cortisol causes the feeling of anxiety.

Free radicals

There are certain foods, that can cause free radicals. When there are free radicals, there is stress and stress/stresshormones = anxiety

The earlier you understand, that anxiety is not always mental, the better.

Then there are certain factors, that are a threat, but wont get recognized as such.

What do i mean by that?

There are certain fundamentals, that are necesary for life to exist.

WATER

Not much to write here. Drink enough water!

FOOD / NUTRIENTS

Our bodies need a full spectrum of nutrients. Without these nutrients, the body can't function properly. With a typical western diet (fast food / nutrient deficient) there is a almost 100% guarantee, to suffer from (mental) illness at some point in life.

Your body literally consists of the food you eat. When you eat garbage, your body consists of garbage.

But not only that: As i stated earlier, there are certain foods, that can cause anxiety by themselves. The foods are not healthy, and they are not natural.

LIGHT

Vitamin D is a necessary nutrient our body produces, when we are out in the sun. The body also produces Melatonin, which is necessary for relaxing sleep.

When we are deficient of sunlight, we are deficient in nutrients our bodies need to function properly.

MOVEMENT

You have to see it this way: Our ancestors couldn't order food over the phone. To eat, they had to hunt or collect food. They had to move! Without moving, they would die.

So lack of movement = life threatening.And remember: threat = anxiety!

We are not finished...anxiety puts you into the so-called ""fight or flight mode"". What is the common ground between FIGHT and FLIGHT?

MOVEMENT!

Anxiety includes the mechanism to get rid of anxiety (stress hormones). To get rid of stress hormones, you have to move!

But what happens, when we suffer from anxiety in our modern society? When there is no ""real"" threat?There is no reason to fight or flee, so there is no movement.When there is no movement, stress hormones maintain in the blood stream, so anxiety can't lift.

REGENERATION/SLEEP ROUTINES

Your body needs rest! 7-9 hours of sleep. Ban your mobile devices from your bed room!

I’ve heard all sorts of methods to fall asleep faster &amp; get more quality sleep, but I’ve used &amp; continue to use The Chill Pill (highly recommend)

Long story short: The more natural your lifestyle, the better!

SPIRITUALITY

Never ever have i thought, that i would get ""all spiritual"", but spiritual teachings like Buddhism and Hinduism were a big influences on my way out of anxiety.

Don't be too narrow-minded and give it a try!

Buddhism and Hinduism are literally dealing with these kind of issues (anxiety &amp; depression) successfully for over 1000 years.

If a doctor can't help you or you don't ""RESPECT THEIR AUTHORITAH"", try Buddhism/Hinduism. You won't regret it!

With the help of this tools, i were back to normal after \~ 6 month – 1 year.

""Back to normal"" is a mere understatement, because my change not only got rid of the anxiety, but brought a quality of life, i couldn't even image BEFORE the anxiety disorder.

There is no solid time window...how long a person needs to get rid of his anxiety is totally up to im.

How much work does he/she invest?

Whats his/her priorities?

Etc.

TL;DR (How i got rid of my anxiety disorder)-Meditated 40-60 Minutes a day-Accepted my thoughts and feelings // dropped negative judgement of thoughts &amp; feelings-Changed my lifestyle (nutrient-dense foods, exercise, time in nature, quality sleep)

I think driving might be a trigger for whatever I am feeling. Is it possible for 1 event (driving) to cause anxiety/panic that lasts for a few days afterwards? I work from home, so I don't drive a lot. I don't know if driving is suddenly something that is affecting me. 

Any insight is greatly appreciated!",Anxiety/Panic lasts for day - driving as a trigger?

2022-10-29 06:56:49,Anxiety,"So lately I have been trying to be more positive and less judgmental and more understanding of other peoples behaviors (basically practicing mindfulness) and trying to be kinder but tonight I did something mean and I feel so guilty.

My apartment complex has limited parking and there are times where you can get a spot in the lot and have to park across the street. So tonight when I got home I was so tired and couldn’t wait to get home and get cozy and eat dinner, and there is a u-haul truck parked blocking off 5 spots in front of my building. There was no other parking besides these 5 spots that were being blocked so I had no where to park. There is plenty of space in front of the main door walkway where they could have parked the u-haul so that it would not have been blocking any spots, so I felt that them being parked there was rude. I was angry and frustrated and acted impulsively on my emotions and left a note on their windshield. It didn’t say anything mean, I wrote “nice of you to take up 5 spots” but I still feel terrible. I had a long/stressful day and I took my frustration out on them. I feel so anxious and guilty over this and I don’t know what to do :-(",I feel really bad and it’s causing anxiety
2022-10-29 06:50:35,Anxiety,"I have recently dated a girl who told me she is ""autistic"", because she ""sometimes gets hyper focused on things"", but I didn't agree with it, and didn't think much of it, because she's actually a successful entrepreneur, and she's smart, and looks completely normal to me, but long story short, she's been recently going through a lot of stuff, and she didn't wanna go out again because of it, and at first I was completely okay with it, and told her I'm always gonna be there for her, but then she started messaging me less and less, and then she just stopped, and we hadn't talked in 2 weeks, so I messaged her if she wants to meet me, and she didn't respond, so 2 weeks later, today, I messaged her again, and told her that it's hurtful to just ignore me without any explanation etc. etc. and she responded by saying this:

  
""I thought a lot about talking to you, but my anxiety got so overwhelming that I couldn't bring myself to"", and ""It's not something you've done, I think I just fell into a mentally unstable situation and I'm not quite sure how to interact with others lately"".

2022-10-29 06:35:21,Anxiety,"I’ve (24m) had anxiety since I was in 7th grade. It’s increased gradually over the last 12-13 years. I’ve been through a shitty couple years. Mid 2020 I started using edibles for anxiety. My parents kicked me out at the end of 2020, had to suck it up and just kinda get by for the past two years renting a room. Don’t really talk to my
Family like at all anymore. But I’ve finally landed in an apartment with my girlfriend of 1.5 Years. I have around 11k in savings, so money is okay. 

I attempted a coding bootcamp starting in September, right around the time a moved into my apartment (looking back I should have started later). I was becoming way too overwhelmed working full time and doing the coding bootcamp so I had to postpone my cohort until the future.



I’ve now since then been struggling to relax. My apartment doesn’t feel cozy, it feels like a workplace. I feel super anxious and on edge all of the time now. Even when I get high, I end up just getting panic attacks now.

2022-10-29 06:11:32,Anxiety,"I (23F) have an older sister (28F). I have some trauma from her in the past (maybe 10-13 years ago) when she used to be a drug addict. Minor physical abuse and a lot of emotional/verbal abuse. She has since become a really strong and capable person with a great job and hardly even touches alcohol.

Anyway, I still have a lot of residual ill feelings from that time, mostly subconscious I think. I have always felt a “wall” between us since back then. I feel uncomfortable around her, even though consciously I know she won’t do anything. 

It’s hard to talk to her when she’s at home (I live with my parents still and she sleeps here maybe 1-3 times a week, otherwise she lives with her bf). I don’t know how to say “no” to her about anything. For example, if she asks if she can have something of mine, let’s say some food or snacks I bought for myself (I also don’t make a ton of money, she makes 6x more than me), I always say yes. I feel like she’ll yell at me or something if I say no. She used to take my stuff all the time without telling me or replacing anything. I think she felt like since it’s in the house, everything is shared. 

I’ve pretty much resided to putting notes on stuff saying this is mine, etc. but I know that’s passive aggressive and not really solving anything long term. I feel terrible, and I truly love her, but this wall seems impossible to break down.

I think my really bad anxiety started when i was 11, then panic attacks became a regular thing at 13. We then spent however many years in lockdown and i came out worse than i have ever been. Last school year was alright, nothing good, nothing bad. But something is different this year, i miss being my old self.

My last pill was a week ago now and I feel more like myself but now the anxiety has come back like a ton of bricks. I kinda forgot how bad it was and the last few days have been rough. I've been having panic attacks in the morning, in the evening, and all throughout my day.

Its nothing I haven't dealt with tbh, I've been doing CBT for the past 14ish years so I am coping. Part of me is just so tired of this feeling. So tired of just every little thing being blown out of proportion in my head. So tired of feeling random panic and trying to track down my thought pattern to find the cause.

I had a counselling session yesterday and they said I should increase my dose to 50mg as I need to have a therapeutic effect?  

That if I was going to have serious side effects then they would show within a week so increasing should be ok and then I might start to feel better

I've lost 2lb in a week since starting the meds and don't feel like eating.

I was going to try and stay on 25mg but I don't feel any better so maybe it's meant to be at least 50mg for it to work?

I'm still not sure what the counsellor meant by therapeutic dose....maybe I'll have to Google it

2022-10-28 14:37:30,Anxiety,"This is going to be a rant. Not sure where this will go or what I mean to accomplish with it but here I go. And if this is the wrong sub for this post please point me in the right direction.

I’m a 21 year old guy and I’ve been anxious most of my life and socially anxious since I was 12. I remember being intensely uncomfortable around my peers and having no idea how to properly communicate  with them. I always felt like an outcast

In fact I was obsessed with Buddhism and becoming a monk throughout middle school and high school because I was so anxious all the time and Buddhism and Buddhist monks seemed so peaceful and comfortable. I even stayed at a couple monasteries 

But I’ve abandoned that idea and I’m currently trying to become an electrician.

However as long as I can remember this anxiety has been overwhelming. I have fantasized about suicide and addiction for a while but I can never seem to bite the bullet. I have tried many things to overcome this social anxiety, I’ve done improv, stand up comedy, salsa dancing, I accept most social invites. But this fucking anxiety brings me back down to my knees. 

This leads me to want to either kill myself or get addicted to drugs or alcohol so I can feel some relief. 

And I somehow managed to get a gf and she’s a sweet girl. But Im terrified I’m going to lose her. I’ve told her about my struggles but I feel like a person can only put up with so much. I don’t burden her with my problems but I’m so fucking quiet around her. I just can’t talk about anything, every word I speak is forced out tensely and awkwardly and I often cringe and get angry at myself for being this way. I feel like I’m not a human. Even a moderate amount of alcohol doesn’t help. And I’m typing this as I’m lying next to her while she’s sleeping.

I’m terrified of being alone. But I’m so uncomfortable around people and I hate myself for it. 

I seem to lose my ability to communicate. It feels like I can’t have conversations with people about anything. I have nothing to say and if I do know about the topic I forget everything in the moment. It’s like I can’t understand how to socialize or I simply am not capable of doing it despite having done it in the past. I’m so quiet and awkward and it kills me.

I feel so self centered and clumsy and inconsiderate. Just like an idiot.

I get so uncomfortable so often I’m reduced to tears nervous laughter and silent hopelessness. 

I feel hopeless and spend so much time on Reddit reading about other people who feel deeply hopeless and lonely and suicidal and some of the comments make me feel more hopeless. I obsess about suicide, or addiction. And I listen to depressing music. Thank god for kid cudi

I exercise draw read and watch movies but this it feels like anxiety takes a lot of pleasure out of these. I’ve been through therapy for years and it doesn’t seem to help.

But I’m reading a book called feeling good by David burns and I’ve been doing the exercises and they help sometimes so I hope to continue with that and I pray to whatever god will listen that it helps. I really hope I can get better and learn to be kind to myself. And I hope you can to. If anyone feels similar I get it. Hopeless is a lonely and scary place to be. I really hope you can find peace and I feel where your coming from, or at least somewhere similar. God(or something / anything) help us.",Social anxiety hopeless

2022-10-28 13:58:53,Anxiety,"For weeks I’ve been waking up absolutely physically ill with anxiety over an upcoming work trip. I was actually praying I’d get Covid so I’d have a real excuse not to go.

The first day here I felt nauseous and horrible and anxious all day. I couldn’t eat and tbh it sucked. But I made it through the day and that felt good and gave me like 10% more confidence for the next day. And so on.

I’ve had anxiety every day here, but every day it has been less and less. Now I’m leaving and I can’t believe I made it through.

Recently I traveled to Mexico (my first time leaving the country.) where I stayed for about 16 days. Really great experience. I went to about 9 different cities while I was there. Anyways..

I recently got back home (Wednesday Oct. 26) and I don’t know what’s going on. My first night back… I felt very exhausted. Mentally and physically. But mostly mentally. I hadn’t slept a full 8 hours a night my entire vacation in Mexico. I wake up at 3am and I was lost. My partner was laying next to me and I didn’t recognize him. I didn’t know where I was. I thought I was still in Mexico but everything around me seemed very different and I didn’t know what to do. My partner woke up and talked to me and I couldn’t understand what he was saying. It’s like I was awake but also dreaming and I kept slipping and out of sleep. 

I got up in a panic and I went to the restroom. On my way to the restroom I was looking around the house trying to familiarize myself with my surroundings. I started saying my address and state I live in. But then I would slip back into thinking I was in Mexico. It was such a terrifying thing. I felt like I was losing my mind. Eventually I was able to calm myself down and being myself to the present moment and I laid back in bed and fell asleep till 11am. I still feel very mentally drained and very tense and stressed out. My mind also feels foggy.

2022-10-28 12:28:41,Anxiety,"Just about any time olanzopine (zyprexa) is brought up it's in a negative light. ""This stuff will kill you, it will shrink your brain and make you a vegetable, it will make you gain 40 pounds"".... I’m not discounting all the negative things this drug can do. It is in fact an extremely powerful drug with a laundry list of side effects. But I feel that we only ever get one side of the story. For me, olanzapine has dramatically improved the quality of my life. I’ve been taking it off label for anxiety and OCD for 4 years now, and it’s the only that ever worked for the severe panic attacks, psychosomatic nausea, depression, and anxiety I’ve been experiencing since age 7. Initially I took 5mg of it and didn’t like how sleepy and heavy it was making me, but within a matter of months, I was down to 2.5 mg and feeling great with minimal side effects. For the 4 years I’ve been taking it, 3 of those years have been on 1.25 mg, half of the smallest pill.

I’ve only come to appreciate just how much this drug has helped me now that I’m currently taking a break from it just for the sake of experimentation. I didn’t suffer withdrawals, but before long I did find all my classic mental ailments from my childhood and teenage years creeping back into my life with a vengeance. I would barely consider myself functional now having been off olanzapine for a month. I’m depressed, have no appetite, anxious as all hell, have no interest in my hobbies…just feel generally terrible and hopeless again.

I’ve tried a lot of different drug concoctions over the years, and olanzapine was the only one that ever gave me lasting relief. Life is genuinely worth living when I’m on it. I won’t lie, I do worry about the prospects of having it slowly bore holes in my brain over the decades, but I honestly think that without it, I don’t have much chance for a high quality of life, and the risks might demonstrably the benefits I get from it.

Sorry for the 10,000 page manuscript I just typed out, I was just curious if anyone here has had a similar experience, since the reception to this medication is so overwhelmingly negative.",Anyone else had Olanzopine change their lives for the better
2022-10-28 12:20:46,Anxiety,"I 24M have been through many traumatic experiences but the one that i see infecting the way i act the most is relationship trauma.

I wont dive into my current dating scenario as i am trying to get over my trauma and not bring it into this new relationship.

I started dating amd having girlfriends in high school. I started out as just another npc in the school but i found my way into the 2013 emo cliche and i liked the aesthetic of the edgy experienced mature kids. Amd because i liked a girl with that style. I dated a few people and had a few girlfriends in high school and my early adult life but they all had one or a few things in common; they would cheat, or lie alot, or use me. I have even been physically abused by some. 
    I gave my all into every relationship ive been in when it came to giving and expressing affection and care to all of these women. I am the nice guy thats actually a nice guy with no bad intentions other than giving my love to a significant other.
   When i like a woman i commit right then and there to make a connection and let the feelings grow into a relationship. I have the mindset of when i want somthing, i fucking get it. Now i know how that sounds in this context but thats me for all things from a raise at work to a car ect.

To tell a story of an ex of mine, we were together for 2 years and lived together. I was the one with the job and the car so i provided almost everything when all i really needes in return was recognition and returned affection but she wouldnt give me either. I was convinced i was nothing short of her last option for a relationship and that i was mever enough in any context.  I didnt make enough money,  i spend too much time working on my truck or the house or taking care of my life, i was told my dick was too small for her even though im above the american average. She would emotionally manipulate me and verbally abuse me almost every other day to get what she wanted. I was so low in self image that i stuck around because i felt like i didnt amount to any better person than her.

    I gave her the cell phone she had and used it to meet other men while i was at work or school and she would sleep around in my own home. I eventually caught her and we broke up. Fast forward 4 months we got back together so i could cheat on her with the girl i was already with a month before so i could make her feel my pain at least once compared to the 7 times she did to me. She didnt care and continued to try to emotionally manipulate me.

I eventually moved across the country amd left her behind but the trauma from that one woman amd many others since ive moved has stuck with me like a cancer amd the trauma has eaten away at my ability to love anyone but more importantly it has made me so paranoid with every new person that they leave me behind. Very few have broken past my emotional barriers and theyve been great people but very very few.

Currently i am dating again and this one is the complete opposite of the toxic woman ive come to know. I want this connection we have to grow but i need to be at peace with my past so i dont bring the trauma enduced paranoia and trust issues into this new flame. I refuse to live my life and die without finding love and i have hope that this one is it. I cant mess this up because i dont know how to handle a heartbreak anymore and im afraid of what itll do to me.

The stupidest thing is that I had even had this bottle of alcohol before, so I KNEW it was alcohol but for some reason my anxiety brainwashed me to think it’s not bc why wouldn’t he ask me for ID.

2022-10-28 11:39:19,Anxiety,"My boyfriend and I both enjoy gaming. He has a number of friends he plays with, sometimes in groups and sometimes just the two of them. Whenever he plays with his friend group (mainly it'll be FPS games such as call of duty and modern warfare), I'll get super wrapped up in the fact that, mentally, he's more focused on his game than he is on me because he can't exactly pause the game he's on. And then I end up losing interest in whatever I'm doing (especially if I'm doing something by myself). It bothers me that I focus on such a thing, because I do not see myself as a clingy individual. Most of the time, it isn't a issue since I'm focused on my own game like Assassin's Creed or Elder Scrolls Online. But if I'm watching YouTube or Netflix and he's playing with friends, it becomes a lot harder for me to focus (and because he can be kind of loud lol). I don't have anything against the fact that he plays games with his friends. I'm glad he does. But for whatever reason, my stupid brain just can't relax and let it go. 

About a month ago, he told me that on Friday Oct 28th (tomorrow lol), that he's be playing the new Modern Warfare II game all day with his friends. All day.

I’m kind of shy and like to keep to myself, but I try to validate and make sure that I make people feel comfortable. In the past, though, when I’ve wanted to stand up for myself, people have called me mean or tried to shout me down, so I feel like I’m backed into a corner where people see me as a pushover and try to push me around but the second that I speak up then suddenly I’m a bully.

She was the type to like monologue about her life or would go on and on even if people were giving social cues for her to stop, and she was the type always to want to be the center of attention. She would get upset if people would compliment me and started to put down my personality and say things like you either never say anything, or you talk too much still love you, though or would tell me that my hair looks overprocessed. I did a slow fade with her after she started doing this constantly than she sent me some long text message saying that we shouldn’t be friends after she saw that I had been ignoring her for weeks, and I said OK, hope you the best.

She tried to come back into my life two years later, but I rejected her and told her that I hope her the best. She tried to get info from my mutual friend about me, saying she was worried about me and that her friend was toxic, mostly blaming me.

The last friend(30F) I had was the same type. Where she loves being the center of attention and constantly sends me photos wanting me to compliment her, or any time we go out, she wants me to take 1 million pictures of her. At first, I could put up with this because she was friendly towards me or would compliment me. But recently, her boyfriend cheated on her, so we started going out more to like bars and clubs, and she gets lots of attention. Still, sometimes I want to talk to guys because I’ve been hung up on my ex for years and not talking to guys, and she would get visibly angry any time a guy would compliment me or be nice to me.

Recently I saw someone new, and the week before, I had stayed with her the entire night and played wing women with her and got her phone that she left in an Uber the next day. Then the guy I liked was texting me a week later to come to hang out, and I was with her at a bar. I gave her Uber money to go home and went to see that guy because I missed him and didn’t get to see him the week before, and my friend sent me a message cursing me out and calling me an awful friend.

Then she called me an sl\*t to our mutual friend a week later, saying that I’m sleeping with the whole town even though this person works as a sugar baby or is Work does a sex worker. On my birthday, she started calling me stupid and started calling me names and got angry with me because the guy smiled at me and then the next night, when I didn’t want to go out with her my birthday weekend then, she got angry with me and tried to pressure me to go out with her.

I don’t understand why I keep attracting women like this. They always try to imply that I’m ugly or not as attractive as I think when guys pay attention to me, or they make it as though I’m making them insecure if guys compliment me. How can I stop attracting self-absorbed friends?

TL;DR: Keep having toxic friendships where they put me down and I don't know why",Why do I attract bad friends? (26F)

Working on it during any free time I have and helping make big choices about the house and my siblings haven’t done much to help and it feels like all the weight is on my mom my stepdad and I’s shoulders. Now here comes the part about the paint, we are finalizing the house and got down to the paint colors for my room which I’ll be sharing with my two older sisters. At the very beginning I told them I didn’t want to be involved in picking our room color because I didn’t care what color we did and it would just cause me unneeded anxiety about potentially choosing the wrong color. Well tonight my mom and I were picking up the last few gallons of paint and she said since my sisters wouldn’t answer the phone and they hadn’t decided on a color it was up to me to decide. They claim they don’t hate to color but they have a million and one critiques about the color I chose and I tried telling them that this is why I didn’t want to pick the color and none of them seem to understand that if we keep the color I chose I’ll never stop thinking about how much they hate the color and that I messed up our room. Now I’m crying hiding in the car while my mom and one of my sisters talks about paint colors in the house. I’m just really tired of this damn house.",I’m crying over a paint color.

Ive had dizziness, heart palpitations and tingles in my legs this year. Had my blood, heart, spine and brain checked- all good.

I did have the feeling before that I wasn’t able to breathe but it was only for short periods of time. 

Now I had Covid 4 weeks ago with mild symptoms. The first days I was out of breath quite quickly. After a week I felt fine again.

Now for the last 10 days or so I have the feeling that I am suffocating. I had it even before Covid but now I have it 24/7 almost. Especially at night when it’s dark and everyone is asleep I feel like I am dying. Now since I’ve had Covid I am of course super worried it’s Covid related and it’s all I can think about which makes it worse.

A client I’m assigned to has been upset at our team’s work product for the entire week. My boss and I were figuring out a response to their latest email and it happened. My heart rate was through the roof, I couldn’t breathe, felt like I was going to die, started crying hysterically, and could not stop shaking. All over typing a response to an email. I was so ashamed.

Thankfully my boss was understanding and some of my coworkers came to check on me. I ended up leaving work early and skipping important calls I should have been on. I don’t know what I should do. I feel terrible and embarrassed that I disappeared when my coworkers needed support. They’re still working right now (it’s late at night here) and I’m at home doing nothing. I don’t even want to think about what my client thinks of me just disappearing. I keep replaying the events in my head, my chest feels heavy and tight, and I just want to cry.

And since i started talking with her again i have this nagging feeling that i am not depressed, that i am not with anxiety, look at what shes passing and i caused that, and im feeling like im not enough, not even enough to be depressed, i wake up every day and go to school and i dont...i dont question it. My mind doesnt wonder during morning, i dont feel the need to be on the bed the entire day - in fact, i physically cannot do that, ive tried.

Ive posted before, one person helped me with a lot of stuff, but it also didnt go away, its piling up and the thing that i most hate about it is that i am still doing things. Getting happy. Smiling.

If I do take anything for those, it’ll be after trying stimulants. I don’t know if providers are just trigger happy to prescribe medication or what. My therapist mentioned anxiety and ADHD medication quickly and my PCP did the same.

I always overthink, and what makes it worse is I always think about the worst possible case scenario and the impact that could happen. I always overthink about the possibility and it makes me so anxious. I hate that anxiousness feeling. I hate it so much. 

I was recently diagnosed with hemorrhoids and my doctor said that it’s not as bad, she’ll prescribe me a cream to ease it, eat more vegetables and fruits etc. Even beforehand, I kept panicking that I may have cancer since I have bloody stools. Even though I don’t have it anymore, I keep thinking that what if it comes back. What if there’s something they haven’t seen. I just overthink and overthink and consequently my body feels bad over it and what if that body feelings from my body is the disease I may have. 


I keep thinking what if I pass bloody stool again even though it only happened a few times. I started eating more vegetables and fruits, taking sitz bath, limiting bad food that started my hemorrhoids in the first place. I ate a little bit of bbq frozen nuggets but not as much. Since my mom said it’s ok if you don’t eat too much which I didn’t and I ate more veggies and fruits. I guess things are getting better little by little but my anxiety remains the same. What if I pass bloody stool again? It looks more normal now but what if? I fucking hate anxiety. I want it to stop. I want to be known that everything will be alright and just keep eating more veggies and fruits and the hemorrhoids will most likely be gone.

I get nauseous all the time and experience tightness in my chest as well as palpitations. I do have panic attacks from time to time. I got a new part time job last week and I am having a very hard time adjusting. I have a hard time advocating for myself and asking questions.

2022-10-28 08:46:51,Anxiety,"I've guessed for a while now that a coworker of mine does not like me, but I'm starting to get  verbal confirmation from others that she has been (and I quote) ""shit-talking about me."" This year has been tough. I haven't transitioned into a new role that I was promoted to as well as I would've hoped. I've been experiencing burnout from a large workload, and there have been dropped balls on my end. That's understandably frustrating as a coworker. 

What's bothering me is that she never discusses her frustrations with me. Instead, she's turning to others in the office, many of whom are my friends (which she knows). When they suggest she talk to me, she shrugs it off. And in ignoring the issue, the situation has only gotten worse. I've been asked to be more vulnerable at work, while also being isolated from my team and gossiped about. Those two things don't add up.

The good news is that I received a job offer last week for a role for which I'm much more suited, so I'll be leaving in 2 weeks. But before I go, I want to confront this coworker. I tend to avoid confrontation due to social anxiety and people-pleasing, but I know I'll regret not speaking with her. At the very least, I want to let her know that the gossip has gotten back to me, and I'm disappointed that an issue that could have been solved civilly became so ugly and contributed to a toxic work environment. 

I'm a bit worried that my anxiety will take over or that my emotions will get the better of me. I really do want to keep this civil. Are there any words of advice out there about how I should approach her? Any similar stories?

But then they said that everybody’s human too, and admitted to themselves that they self talk as well. So it made me feel a tiny bit better. Don’t know how im gonna face them tmr tho 😩 I already asked my supervisor to take a day or 2 off and that I’ll be back on Monday next week. Need to calm my mind here 🙏",Bad day at work 😩
2022-10-27 12:26:40,Anxiety,"I found with my anxiety that a lot of the recommendations for managing/coping simply weren't accessible to me.  For example, reading and meditation.  I used to love reading and I used to meditate before my anxiety issues but with my anxiety my head was so busy that it was impossible.  

Over the years, I've come up with a few strategies that have been golden for me, and some I suspect probably not at all likely to be sanctioned by the typical therapist.  I'm sharing a few of my odd ones, and would love to hear about others that have little strategies that might not be among those commonly suggested.

Silly body: kind of like Monty Pythons silly walks, but embracing the entire body - the face (especially the tongue and mouth - because of the very high potential for looking very silly), the head, neck, arms, hands, fingers, shoulders, torso, legs, the feet and toes.  The goal: to move as many parts as possible, at the same time with no co-ordination, symmetry or repetitive movements.  And if my head would allow, to imagine myself out of my body, above myself looking down at myself and laughing. 

With my anxiety, I used to constantly feel like fear was literally running through my veins.  I could feel it through my entire body.  Trying to exercise increased my anxiety, but silly body never has and sometimes really helped relieve or reduce the sensation of fear running through my veins and quiet my head a little and have me feel freer and less restricted.  Thankfully, that sensation is now fairly rare for me, but I still embrace silly body just to improve how I feel mentally and physically.

My personalised delusion:  I get triggered by hearing peoples misfortune - for example, being homeless or not having enough to eat or not being able to access health care.  So in response, I decided to allow myself short periods of fantastical delusion.  I sit in a comfy chair, close my eyes and pretend that I invented a star trek style replicator that is self replicating but about the size of a small macbook, so that everyone on the planet can have one.  These replicators can create the perfect food for every individual so that no-one is hungry or sick.  They can also summon up homes holodeck style so that no-one is homeless.  This imaginary replicator pulls all it's energy from thin air by feeding on the energy within atoms, and converting energy to matter, so all basic needs are provided for everyone, without destroying the environment or torturing animals.   I know this is a fantasy, but it creates an imaginary sense of being useful and everyone being safe for a little while, which is a great relief and makes it easier for me to tune back into reality.

Embracing comedic hatred: Another trigger for me is hearing about people doing bad things to others or animals - violent crimes, wars, general animal cruelty and neglect etc.  I'm really fortunate to have a very understanding partner, who is incredibly accepting and compassionate.  So we've come to an understanding, that I call embracing comedic hatred.  When I feel anger at reading about someone doing something bad to others, I make a statement about what I feel the perpetrator deserves.  We both understand it is just letting off steam, not a reflection of anything I would actually do,  and that it's for our ears only.  There's no judgement by either of us, except maybe a laugh if I manage to express it in a funny enough way.  Attempted humour is a key focus, though not always successful because I'm not naturally funny.  Typically the statement will be of the form ""This person is a 'series of descriptive words' and deserves 'description of some form of obscure but appropriate punishment' "".  I find this often prevents me thinking obsessively or ranting and triggering myself.  I might even feel pleased afterwards if I've managed to make it funny enough.

These have been useful for me because these were the only forms of creative visualisation that I was able to manage and they helped me reduce unhelpful thinking.  Now I'm able to visualise more mundane scenarios for other things that trigger my anxiety.  For example, I can now visualise myself lying comfortably in bed, enjoying the sound of rain instead of being triggered by the rain and having runaway anxiety.  Housework always used to be a mental struggle because it didn't occupy my mind and the thoughts would race in.  Now when I'm doing housework, I visualise myself as someone who gets pleasure from housework and finds it relaxing.  Success in these areas is still limited, but baby steps are being made.",Sharing my personal odd little anxiety helpers - I'd love to hear yours - possible triggers

2022-10-27 12:18:08,Anxiety,"It's night where I am. Posting again here to get the clutter out like before since word votiming on reddit has been my final measure against 4am worry-fests. Relationships are hard. Knowing when to give and take always seemed like it was just apart of the package. But where do you draw the line? At what point does it become a game of ""who's the better, 'correct' partner"" tug of war. It's not about being innocent in the eyes of  the dating law, it's about supporting someone amazing who deserves it all. Feeling like a burden eats away at you and you feel compelled to provide. To perform. And as the pressure you built for yourself starts buckling your knees you wonder if they'd still be interested if they saw the ""real you"": a tired, hollow slob (at least you *think* you are)  Was that fearless, in-control, over-achieving person they first met even real to begin with? What if ""just being me"" is a detriment. What if that ""me"" is an empty soul sucker that's desperate for affection no matter how misplaced. 

The thought of my ""true self"" being a jaded, half-alive burn-out pushover is *mortifying* to me, but I've lived that way for so long now I don't remember how it feels to feel like myself most of the time. It's like that past version of me was a dream. *This* is what growing up is about? I'm not my anxiety or my depression, but damn those two beat me beyond recognition on some days. This is what the therapy's for, I guess. 

Mental strength is familiarity with pain. It's being comfortable with being uncomfortable. And like physical strength, its unattainable unless you've pushed yourself harder than the last time. At least, that's what I've gathered. Ahh the thoughts are buzzing again. I don't have to be giving all these scattered random topics so much time, thought, and energy, I really don't. How to act around others and your partner shouldn't play out like a script. Life happens all around us as it always has and always will.

2022-10-27 11:51:52,Anxiety,"I (24f) haven't been able to sleep for two days and have bugged my loved ones too much with this so here I am. They're sick of telling me, ""grow up, stop worrying, it'll be fine."" But that hasn't helped me sleep any better or made this terrible knot in my stomach go away.
I decided months ago to quit my job this month. We were going to move, but now we aren't moving, but I have already made travel plans that require me to not be working. So, even though I haven't put in my two weeks, there really is no going back. It's already decided I'm quitting (terrifying.) I've been so excited to quit but I've never quit a job before. It's a decent paying job that isn't awful, I don't really enjoy my schedule or what I'm doing but I'm pretty good at it. I'm putting in my two weeks next week. Another worker in my department beat me to it, which leaves only one person left after I leave. We're a retail store, too, so they are just entering high seasonal time. I am required to do a lot at work beyond just my assigned job duties and I feel so guilty quitting. I go above and beyond and do everything I'm asked, I'm very reliable and I feel like I'm letting everyone down by leaving. I don't really want to work here but I don't know if I'll be able to find anything that pays as good, plus I finally got over the anxiety of a new job and now I'm leaving.
As far as my net/plan, I have $20k in savings (we want to buy a house eventually, so its not totally expendable,) my bf said he has no problem covering rent and food until I get another job, and I finished my resume and applied today for 3 positions at a company doing work I used to do and enjoy much more with a better schedule. But because of my travel plans I won't be able to start until Jan and I also wanted to take a bit of time for myself and to see my family, who live far away and I havent been able to see them for more than a couple hours every month or so.
I'm just so anxious about big changes and uncertainty. And the confrontation of putting in my two weeks, I've never done it before. At my old job (at a school) all my coworkers knew at the beginning of the year I'd be leaving at the end of the term.
What if I regret leaving? What if I can't get a job in the field I want? What if I do and its worse than the one I have now? What if I try to come back and they won't hire me? Am I just quitting because things ""got hard"" and I ""can't handle it""? What if things don't get better (like my schedule) like I'm hoping? Should I have just stayed at my job and tried to come up with some kind of compromise?
I'm so excited for new opportunity and some time off to work on myself but I'm getting so anxious about it I can hardly function. So, please, any wise words of advice or reassurance of how to deal with quitting and making big decisions and life changes would be much appreciated. Thank you 💕",Quitting my job - need reassurance

Shouldn’t be a problem for a lot of people and I wish that were the case for me. Unfortunately driving long distances causes me to experience severe anxiety. I don’t really know why, I’ve been going to therapy, I take medication daily And most of the time I’m completely fine. Except for times like this when I had to drive the truck to an unknown destination. I’m 28 years old, I’ve been driving for more than a decade, I’ve never been in an accident and I have a clean driving record. Yet here I am, terrified to go on that trip tomorrow. Audiobooks don’t help, music doesn’t help, nothing helps. I can’t even tell you what exactly triggers it. I’ll be fine for 15-20 minutes and then I’ll start to experience waves of intense anxiety. It’s such a crushing physical sensation. Like I can’t catch my breath, my vision feels tunnelled. My heart pounding and hands are sweating. It feels like I’m being sucked into a whirlwind of anxiety and I’m constantly fighting it. Trying to repeat words of affirmation, trying to regain my focus and relax but I can’t. It’s extremely difficult to deal with… I love my job though. I don’t want to quit. Doing these long drives are the only downside to it and I rarely ever have to go further than an hour.

I’m not really sure how to deal with this so I thought I would try to vent and see if this helps. 

It was on my city’s public transit system - the particular train line I use for my work commute goes through some pretty rough areas. I’ve always minded my business and don’t look up from my phone and tonight was no different. A man and his (presumed) girlfriend got into a very loud argument on the other side of the train car, and she walked over to my side to get away from him and bummed a cigarette from the dude sitting across from me. He walks over and continues yelling at her - some pretty nasty stuff. 

My eyes are glued to my phone at this point, I don’t think I was actually doing anything, just anxiously scrolling back and forth on twitter. His focus turns to me (the only white person in the car, and probably the whole train) and he starts saying all sorts of shit to me that would make me sound like Rush Limbaugh if I repeated it all. Things like “because you have blond hair and blue eyes you think you got everything don’t you” (I have very dark brown hair) and some other race-related things - things I actually would agree with him on if presented in a less threatening way! 

Throughout his initial tirade I didn’t say anything, and I only glanced up once when I realized he had started talking towards me. He then started saying things I definitely do NOT agree with, mostly about how much he’d like to kill me, saying he was going to follow me off the train and to my house so he could beat me to death or something. He had a pretty vivid imagination. This went on for a couple minutes and my heart was racing the entire time, I didn’t want to get off early while all his attention was on me so I silently waited it out. Everyone on the train did the smart thing and didn’t say anything either, which is probably what I would’ve done also. Right before my stop, his attention was back to yelling at his girl and they stepped into a more private section of the car. 

I basically ran out of the train as soon as the doors opened, and checked behind me to make sure he wasn’t making good on his earlier promise. He was glaring at me through the train window, but luckily didn’t follow me off. I ran down into the subway to catch my connecting train, still looking over my shoulder every other second, and stopped at a CVS by my apartment to collect myself, which is where my first panic attack in a few years kicked in. 

I’m still shaking now, about 3 hours later, and have already started comparing therapists in my network. I’m going to use this situation to finally get back to therapy, something I should’ve done years ago, so that something good can come out of the situation. Whether I was actually in danger or not could be up for interpretation, and although I think I handled it fairly well, I’m really struggling to handle the aftermath of the experience.

The moral of this story is to not wait to go to therapy until someone threaten to kill you I guess!",Someone threatened to kill me today.

2022-10-27 11:15:42,Anxiety,"Warning for everyone who is triggered by discussions related to menstruation and abortion. 

Hello! I’d like to talk today about anxiety that is brought on or worsened by hormones. I am a 25F who has had anxiety all of my life, but in the last two years has worsened to the point where I can barely function half the time. Where to start, where to start.

2 years ago I fell pregnant. I was very happy but unfortunately due to medical issues with the fetus I had to have an abortion. This devastated me and caused me to be depressed and anxious. I couldn’t find my way out, and I had this nagging feeling that my trauma wasn’t the only thing causing my anxiety. I pushed that feeling down and went to therapy and psychiatrists. I got my thyroid checked. I changed my diet and started exercising more when I could get out of bed. My therapist said to write down my feelings and physical symptoms in a diary or an app. We started noticing that my anxiety was deeply connected to my menstrual cycle. Instead of feeling worse around my period, I felt better. More like my old self. Less anxious and by far, happier. I also had been dealing with loss of libido and dissatisfaction after orgasming. (I could get the big O, but it didn’t quite hit the spot). All of which could easily be attributed to my anxiety and depression, but something inside me tells me it is hormone related. I finally got my doctor to green light a hormone test but my insurance is fighting it, saying it’s not medically necessary. So I bought a cheap one off of Amazon and it’ll be here in a week or so, but I won’t get the results for 2 weeks-4 weeks after.

I am impatient and having quite a rough time (I’m post-period with the worst anxiety I’ve had in a while) and I was wondering if anyone has had a similar experience or knows someone who’s had a similar experience. Anyone in the medical field is also very welcome to put their two cents in. 

Sorry to all of those this may offend, but if you have an opinion on my abortion, please keep it to yourself. If I could have my baby in my arms I would give anything in the world. That being said, I’m very much pro-choice and very aware some people might not agree with that.",Hormones and Anxiety?

This time I hadn't done it in a while. 

Then 3 days later I see a video on YouTube recommended to me called ""Stop \*\*\*\*ing off"" and boom now I have intrusive thoughts that the universe for whatever reason, does not want me to be doing this, and that if I do, something bad will happen AGAIN. And this is so stupid and embarrassing that I can't bring myself to talk to my therapist about it.

About a few weeks ago I went to an event with some people I was familiar with except for one person despite being in the same organization for awhile. I forgot his name because the organization is big and we rarely talk. We only have mutual friends. 

At that time I didn’t know there were two people with the same name. I only knew one person with that name out of the two because I talk to them a lot. Let’s call them Bob 1 and Bob 2. At that time I was only familiar with Bob 2. 

So we’re in a group and a friend calls me to ask where Bob 1 is at but I thought she was talking about Bob 2 because that was the only Bob I knew of at that time. 

And so I ask the group, hey where’s “Bob 2”, everyone got silent and I didn’t know why. I told friend, “I don’t see him, he’s not here.”

No one said anything to me about it but Bob 1 never says hi to me or smile at me anymore and gives me a dirty look. Just bad tension between us. I didn’t find out I made a horrible mistake until two weeks later while talking to one of my friends that’s close to Bob 1 and she starts talking about him.

Recently I’ve been pursuing doctor’s appointments for a whole range of issues; daily headaches, trouble sleeping, bad stomach issues/diarrhoea, bad fatigue, constantly shaky hands, occasionally feeling faint, etc. I’ve known for a long time I struggle with anxiety but never really pursued it medically, and I thought maybe it had a physical underlying problem such as a thyroid issue. They ran some tests though and my thyroid is fine, and I’ve to get a neurological exam to rule out anything worse.

The doctor told me something interesting today though; I was explaining to him that while I am a very anxious person, I’m not anxious every minute of the day and only a handful of times have I felt like I was close to a panic attack; it strikes more randomly or in certain social situations from day to day. He told me that in men anxiety tends to present more in physical symptoms; basically every symptom I described above, and you can be living with it and perhaps identify it as anxiety but never really connect the dots to how bad the issue is.

He prescribed me propanolol for the physical symptoms to see if it helps (especially the constantly shaky hands which I think the doctors are concerned about most in a guy my age), but I was just wondering if anyone else knew this? The whole thing about men presenting tending to present more with the physical side of anxiety. I thought it was really interesting and made sense to me: society tells men to repress their emotions, so it comes out in other ways related to your health. If that’s true I think it’s something we should be encouraged to pay more attention to.

2022-10-27 10:09:25,Anxiety,"I’ve noticed with my own anxiety that I’ll obsess over an issue, usually until I get a solution, and then it’s onto the next thing to obsess about. For months I dealt with health anxiety (it was basically a different thing every two weeks or so) and every twinge would cause me to spiral. Now I’m obsessing over the health of my teeth. I’m so scared of losing my teeth. I recently had dental work done, I need to have a few more fillings and I should be done, but I can’t help but catastrophize over my teeth developing more cavities and causing more issues. I’ve started to analyze my teeth daily. Every spot makes me think it’s a cavity in its early stages. I started to buy a lot of dental care products like a water flosser, interdental brushes, etc. My front teeth, even though they were always sensitive, have become noticeably more sensitive since I left the dentist office the other day and idk if it’s a real concern or if my brain really is playing tricks on me. It feels too real for it to not be a real issue. Part of me would love to discuss it with my dentist, but I’m so scared of him saying “then those need to be pulled/root canalled”. I don’t want my front teeth to change, I don’t want to lose them and I’m trying to not freak out about it, but it’s hard to ignore. I also noticed that when I shined a flashlight on my teeth, there’s small cracks and I’m honestly freaking out since I recently started to clench at night and I fear going to sleep at times due to the possibility of cracking a tooth and losing it forever. The stories I’ve seen of people cracking their teeth in their sleep scares me. I noticed the cracks years ago (with the flashlight), but my anxiety wasn’t too bad before and I didn’t clench so I didn’t think too much of it. Would this be considered OCD mixed in with Anxiety or is it just anxiety that’s taking over my life? I’m HEAVILY considering seeing a therapist soon because this year has really done a number on me and I think it’s about time that I get a bit of help.

At some point earlier this year I recognized how bad my habits and daily routine are due to being preoccupied with my thoughts (honestly I was quite oblivious to it for a long time).
For example, I would go days without changing my pajamas (that I stay in all day cause I go nowhere…), forget to brush my teeth, forget to eat throughout the day, and just overall forget to take care of myself. It sounds kind of like depression but I’ve been through that and I would more so disregard doing such tasks rather than be forgetful.

2022-10-27 09:08:39,Anxiety,"

I’ll try to keep this short. Basically, I’ve (m24) only ever had my mom and my siblings in my life while growing up. Siblings helped me deal with my mom when she got crazy/moody/just mom things, my mom is of course just my mom and she’s the only parent I’ve had for the important parts of my life. 

Whenever my siblings give me advice, I listen to it more than if others were to tell me the same advice. A very real example is if my gf (f24) gave me advice or an opinion on something, I’d take it with a grain of salt because she can be a bit exaggerating at times and at that, we’re two very different people too (introvert/extrovert, patient/temper, etc) that I figured it may work or make sense for her but not me. Now, let’s say later my siblings gave me the same opinion or advice, it kinda solidified what my gf says. Or it makes it seem more true or believable in my head because they’re the ones who said it. 

Even when my gf and I had big arguments or near-breakups, whenever my siblings gave their advice or opinion then I felt like I had to feel the same way. It started to make me resent her a little or see her as more of a temperamental/ exaggerative person. 

Then, I’m also very defensive over my mom. Granted she isn’t Jesus reincarnated as she’s manipulative, twists stories, gossips, etc, she still is my mom and she’s all I have. Also, she isn’t a terrible person either as she’s extremely caring and truly does put others before herself about 90% of the time to the point where we have to scold her to focus on herself. But I catch myself being defensive over her when something is said about her, specifically from my gf. My friends who have known her for years? I laugh and don’t bat an eye. My gf of 3-4 years who has had multiple instances of bad or uneasy experiences with my mom? I get defensive and almost feel like I’m/she’s being attacked.

My therapist says it seems I have a problem with enmeshment but with my family, and I agree fully. But I don’t want to feel tied by THEIR emotions anymore. Nobody does anything to make me feel like this, I know I do it to myself due to how highly I think of my tight nit family, but that’s exactly why I want it to change. It’s a me issue that’s causing rifts to my own mental state and my relationship. Any advice or experiences is appreciated as to how I can tackle this and fix this.

TL;DR: I hold my family’s thoughts and feelings as the highest form of truth or advice I can get, even if I’m told the same stuff by others who aren’t my family. I understand this is enmeshment and is unhealthy, I want to be better",I believe I’m caught up in an enmeshed relationship with my family

2022-10-27 08:17:46,Anxiety,"Might be triggering for people who are obsessed with bodily sensations. Also driving I guess.

A little over 2 years ago, due to some sinus issues, I got obsessed with monitoring my breathing. Combine that with difficulty sleeping and for the first time in my life, I had a panic attack. Now apparently I have general anxiety. I was able to get my sinus issues to a manageable stage and over a painful period of a few months, my anxiety also reduced. I did see my physician who prescribed me a low dose of Buspar which I am still taking. Also saw a therapist through my work mental health program. Talking with someone about my problem definitely helped me. I can't talk to my family about this cause they will worry too much and I don't think my friends can really relate or understand. Eventually, I got busy with life and was doing okay.

I don't remember the reason why but about a year ago I started to get obsessed with other body sensations. I won't list them cause I don't want to trigger anyone (this was my main problem with reading anything about this issue. Every article, and post would literally include a list). Saw a different therapist cause work changed the provider. They were not great with suggesting any strategies or resources but at least they listened and I managed to get it under control eventually.

Even at my best, I was not back to how I was before but at least I was living life normally. Well normal by my standard. I would have episodes but they only last days and not months. One thing I never quite got over was traveling. Driving, flights, and staying in hotels all increase my anxiety. I think it's a control thing. I don't want to be in an environment where I can't control things. I was never really into traveling but I feel like I have to do this or people will think I am not normal.

This finally brings me to today. Went to a dentist for filling some cavities. No big deal. What I was not expecting was for the anesthesia to numb my nostril. Even though I was breathing I really couldn't tell. Felt like I was drowning. Anesthesia has worn off but my obsession with my breathing is back in full force. 

This has made me realize I am never going to get completely over it. There will always be things that will trigger it. I will spend weeks/months recovering and eventually something else will happen. Anxiety is going to be a lifelong companion for me. 

I think I am going to look for a good therapist. I read that the ones who don't take insurance are supposed to be better so maybe I will see if I can find one of those. I am just hoping they won't try to teach me breathing exercises cause I will laugh in their face and leave.

Sorry if this doesn't make sense. Just wanted to get it off my chest. I will also delete this in a couple of days. In case someone figures out who I am IRL, I don't want them to know about this. I know we talk about acceptance and open discussion of mental health but deep down people think of this as a weakness and they always will.

This is a huge trigger for my anxiety and I cannot understand why, just curious if anyone else is in the same boat. It’ll usually just be standard conversation with coworkers, or anyone really, and it’s like I can start to feel myself finding ways to get out of talking. Like I’ll start inching away, heading towards the nearest door, wrapping up the conversation even if it just started. But I usually immediately regret doing any of that once it’s over. This frustrates me so much, and I’ve never understood what it is that my brain is like “you need to get out of this, immediately!”

Hey all,

I'm new to this page and have been reading a few of the posts. But I'd like to start with a little background about myself.

I have something called emotional dependence anxiety, I am in a recently new relationship with someone who is very independent, but things are going very well and we have a very strong emotional and physical connection (strongest I've ever had with someone) but recently my anxiety has been skyrocketing. Today I got a text from my significant other saying that my emotional dependence is beginning to be a burden on the relationship and that she would like me to talk to someone about it. In no way was the text a break up or a we need a break text, she genuinely wants me to get the help I need so I can get myself somewhere better mentally and so it will have less of an impact on our relationship. (I believe that by this fact alone that she's being honest and saying it's having a burden and she wants me to seek help says a lot that she wants this relationship to work). Anyways like every where therapists are booked months out and I cannot get in to see someone for a while. So I am coming to this sub reddit to seek some advice for how I may alleviate me emotional dependency and get back to the feeling of normal. 

Thank you in advance. Please feel free to to reply to this post or dm me.",New Here

2022-10-27 06:55:47,Anxiety,"I'm asking this here to hopefully get more responses.

I've suffered from social anxiety disorder my entire life. I also have three other anxiety disorders that I've had since I was a child. I also have depression and I'm autistic. 

I have a fear of talking to people, even family. I have a fear of being judged and watched, these are part of social anxiety. I rarely talk to people or leave the house. I even have problems texting and using text chats.

I have issues playing the only online multiplayer game that I play because of anxiety. Things have gotten bad to the point of me having to use several alt accounts (this is allowed). I get so panicked that I play poorly and can't get my head in the game. This is a team based sport. There aren't many players as it isn't a popular game

I told a bunch of players that I have anxiety and discussed it briefly almost five months ago. Everyone was very cool about it. Recently, one of the server owners told his buddy about my alt account, then the buddy told everyone on the server it was me. I nearly had a panic attack. I had been struggling to play because of anxiety, so I started using this specific alt account. I play better this way. Now I don't know how I will play again.

I feel like I have a right to be angry. Server owners shouldn't expose someone's alt accounts. Both of these people knew about my anxiety. The only thing I can say in their defense is that they might not understand how severe it is and they are both young. I believe the server owner is around 22-24, and may not have known that his buddy is a blabbermouth. The buddy is only 19 and has a habit of making fun of people. He's an admin on Discord and he does not take harassment seriously. 

I'm not sure how to handle this. Should I send a polite DM to the server owner expressing how devastating this is to me because of my anxiety? Should I make a public statement on Discord telling people what they did? I've been considering for a while of telling everyone on Discord about my anxiety because people get upset with me a lot, especially new players who don't know about it. Or should I ignore the whole thing and use a new alt account?

I don't mind telling people about my anxiety because it brings awareness to the issue. If people know and understand, then it's less likely they will get mad and insult me for my weird behavior. I am hesitant to tell them about being autistic. I'm not even sure how much of a part that plays in my issues. But the social anxiety disorder controls me. I've always had it, it's all that I know. Fighting it always ends up in things going backwards - getting worse.",How do I handle this specific situation? People not respectful of my issues and privacy.

2022-10-26 16:57:37,Anxiety,"I already feel quite empty inside from depression. I avoid my feelings and pretend they don’t exist which can lead me to suddenly crack when I come to terms with everything. I don’t find much joy in things and I’m worried the medication will make me feel more numb.  
At the same time I do have quite bad anxiety and tend to feel anxious most days so perhaps it will help me deal with my issue of avoidance. I tend to feel extremely hurt by peoples actions and take them personally. I ruminate constantly and have low confidence.

I also have adhd so Im quite concerned I’m going to make things worse for myself with more medication (I take vyvanse which tends to increase my anxiety). Another concern of mine is that a lot of people have said it decreased their sex drive, I already have a very low libido so I’m worried I’ll lose it completely.

I feel less depressed on it. last night I accidentally added too much caffeine in my cup like a spoonful and couple hours later it gave me anxiety attack. I got up to quickly and felt like I was gonna pass out, had to sit down for a bit. that’s when my heart started beating fast proceeding with feeling weak and dizzy. One thing I noticed, when doing deep breathing, which I always thought was cliché and dumb idea to do when having anxiety attack, but it actually slowed my heart beat down I kept doing it every time my heart would start beating fast so that was amazing. I had to sit it out for half an hour. Never experienced this type of physical anxiety before it’s mostly always getting overwhelmed with fear followed by my legs feeling heavy and tingling all over my body which I think it’s more of a panic attack since it makes me feel like I’m about to lose my sanity. But regarding me drinking coffee, I feel like it’s a necessity in my daily life, before it I was always tired never got things done or would get burnt out and had low mood. Coffee really gets me through my day and the buzz from it temporarily Alleviates my anxious thoughts until I get the crash and feel tired and anxious again.

This is my second time testing. First time was two weeks ago, I was so nervous and anxious that I blew past the stop sign and failed to use my turning signals. I’m usually really really good about that stuff, I just couldn’t concentrate on driving I was just focusing on my tester and her trainee who was also in the car with us.

I’m also not that great at parallel parking, what if I get so anxious tomorrow I fail again?

I forgot to mention that on Halloween, I have my first tattoo appointment but it’s far away. If I don’t pass this test tomorrow I’m going to have to use public transportation or Uber‘s. Last time I had to rely on public transportation, I missed my ferry, and that sent me into a depressive spiral. That was back in February, and that incident jumpstarted the worst year on record for me. 

I’m so fucking nervous, and I can’t relax. My social anxiety and generalized anxiety has been so bad this past month. I’m having anxiety attacks and panic attacks like every day. I’m not necessarily scared of what happens if I fail, because I know I can probably make it to my appointment on Halloween. I am more so scared of how I feel if I fail. I’m already very very fragile, battling thoughts of self harm (2.5 months clean), as well as being passively suicidal. I don’t wanna do something I’ll regret. I need to pass this test.

I'm currently an adult in my late 20s, since 13 years of age my home life has gone to complete shit, I don't know what to blame but it's mainly my sibling who has undiagnosed mental problems of extreme rage and violence. He would always attack me and my parents. Always demanding items and things. My parents never removed him from home and are part of the problem. My parents were super hands off and worked a lot , I feel like I never got the love and affection from a mother and the strong bond of a father son relationship. My brother and I never got along and are more different as night and day.

Now this is resurfacing as heart palpitations, breathing problems and a hard time enjoying things. I get the most depressed when I have to come back home to deal with my family life. My parents treat me as I'm the parent and should deal with everything for them and my brother. This has lead me to not finish my schooling on time and becoming very depressed and physically ill.

I don't know what to do as I'm stuck in school, can't work full time and it's really expensive for rent where I live. I've also been placed the burden of being responsible for the family dog. Anything that goes wrong with dog my brother will attack me and threaten me yet he does not spend money or take care of her what so ever. My brother has never finished highschool and is extremely violent and has had run-ins with the law along with destructive relationships, nor does he want to work a job yet wants a luxury life at my parents expense and mine at times. He is a legitimate psychopath and pure evil yet he roams the earth unscaved. Nothing bad has ever happened to him yet he has harmed so many people.

I've been contemplating suicide as my parents have been unsupportive to letting me move out since my teens. They've basically kept me here to tend to their problems, I don't know what to do anymore.

so idk i’m tryna figure out what causing it, i guess it is anxiety?",Dizziness in certain places more than others
2022-10-26 12:53:53,Anxiety,"Hi everyone,

I’m freaking out right now and I feel so trapped and not sure what to do.

For some context, my whole childhood til I moved out (up til I was 18 years old) I lived in a house swarmed with carpet beetles. I mean literally, I could spot ~50-100 in a day. They were in the cereal, the clothes, my poor plushies… everywhere. They coated every part of my parents house. I can’t emphasize enough just how MANY there were. Probably a million in the whole house or more, I swear. Living with them made me extremely depressed, even suicidal as a teenager. I felt disgusting. I also felt like nothing could be done because it’s a big house, with all carpeted floors, and they were EVERYWHERE. That’s why I moved out ASAP after I graduated. 

So now I’m in a one bedroom apartment, and I’ve been here for ~3 years now. Problem is that it’s carpeted, but I figured I’d live (though I’d prefer hard wood floors since I also have 2 cats and I’m allergic to their dander). Until now, it’s been OK. But fuck. I just moved a plastic container in my bedroom and…

25~ larvae squirming on my carpet next to my bookshelf. Probably more, that’s just a guess based on the quick peek I had. And now, I see their husks in all corners. I’m fucking crushed. I’m not extremely organized, but by no means did I live in the hoarder situation my parents had. I feel so gross and awful. I can’t stop crying, and I do know what to do. They’re probably in both my closets, and my clothes drawers. They’re probably on my stuffed animals. They’re probably everywhere. And I’m legitimately terrified, and maybe this sounds odd but I would love to just leave it all behind. I don’t know how I’m going to deal with this. I’m gonna vacuum first and bag up everything on my floor, I guess. It just seems like an insurmountable task. I know logically there’s probably a solution, but my motivation is terrible due to anxiety and depression. I haven’t had a genuine panic attack in a year until today. I don’t know how I’ll sleep tonight.",Panicking over carpet beetle larvae

2022-10-26 12:48:22,Anxiety,"A while ago I was in my city centre to quickly meet with a friend before going back to my nans house. I walked him back to the train station and then made the trek back to town. When I had made it back I decided the trip to town wouldn’t be worth it if I went back empty handed. Having checked the book shop earlier and deciding I didn’t want anything else I set my sights on a record instead. I walked from the top of the town to the bottom and upon finally reaching the record shop I turned around and walked away. I got so nervous at the thought of being the only one in the store I left. While I was walking away I kept telling myself that it was ok to not want to go in and that it was ok to leave town now but I had another thought while I was walking, you can’t leave town empty handed. I eventually worked up the courage to walk back and when I had finally made it I noticed there was a group of people inside. Not being the only one in there helped me so much with the fear, but when the group left before I had picked a record out I was panicking. Until I realised there was a man behind me looking at a different section. I felt, ok in there. I shuffled through all the different genre sections with a strange sense of joy. Joy at the thought I was managing so well. When I had finally picked out the dark side of the moon I went to the till to pay. The only problem was that I had my earphones in (music helps with my anxiety so I didn’t take them out). I could barley hear the man but after some miscommunication with him asking if I wanted a bag I made it out. I was on the verge of tears when I left. Nearly full on crying because I had actually done it. Despite being so scared I went in and bought the record anyway. I’ve never been more proud of myself then when I sat down at that bus stop and I admired the record. The bus was taking a while so I started the 30 minute walk back and the entire walk I was over the moon. It’s such an unforgettable feeling even a few weeks later. Knowing that earlier the same day I didn’t want to buy something from a different store even though I was with my friend and then some twenty minutes later I bought something from the record store completely by myself was a truly intoxicating feeling.",I overcame my anxiety

I’ve had this issue of “smelling bad” ever since I was in high school and I sat next to a kid that smelled bad. From that point I’ve made it a goal to never get to the point of that person and to be as hygienic as I can be. Ever since school started this problem went away until someone that sat next to me mentioned to me that I smelled bad. However, after a while the person told me that they were just kidding. Other instances have made this anxiety be worse. For example if someone plays with their nose or if someone coughs I interpret that is if maybe I do smell. I’m so obsessed with these thoughts that it’s all I think about and it’s starting to take a toll on my mental health. I’m becoming less motivated to pay attention in school due to thoughts like “I probably smell bad” or scanning the room to see if there are any signs of me actually smelling bad. These thoughts make me avoid social events and I barely go out. It’s at the point where I don’t even wanna go buy groceries. I have to deal with this problem everyday and I honestly don’t know how much longer I can deal with this until I go crazy. I’ve looked this up and sure enough other people are dealing with it but it doesn’t seem like there are any fixes yet. This is called olfactory reference syndrome and it’s making my life a living hell. I just want to live a normal and social life like how I used to be and not having to worry about this. I shower everyday in the morning, I wash my clothes, I never wear the same pair of anything after being previously used, I use deodorant, and i let my shoes air dry. I also use colognes like YSL EDP and Versace Dylan Blue. I make sure to only put 2 sprays since it might be overpowering to some. This is a cry for help.",Anxiety of smelling bad

2022-10-26 10:46:46,Anxiety,"Hi there. I will try to keep it short but I am a 24 y/o female with bipolar type 2. I’ve always had social anxiety and gad as well. 

About mid September I started having debilitating anxiety attacks. From the moment I woke up to the moment I went to bed I was basically having one massive panic attack. I wasn’t able to eat at all because I was scared I would choke with how dry and tight my throat constantly felt (I have come to realize it’s a symptom of my panic attacks). I was taking up to 3 clonazepam a day at that point because my anxiety was so bad. I couldn’t leave my house. I was calling off work shifts because of the anxiety. I couldn’t even ride in the car which is one of my favourite things and something I normally find soothing. I would panic and feel trapped in the car. 

I’ve made progress since then. I am not able to eat in public yet but I can eat at home albeit I eat pretty slow. I am not needing clonazepam in the morning anymore and am able to function during the day. I still feel anxious but it is bearable. I can ride in the car without freaking out and saying I need to get out of the car multiple times. I am going to work and not taking a clonazepam before work or if I do it’s once a week maybe maximum. 


At night time however I feel like I get bit with a sludge hammer or dread, intense anxiety and feeling complete and utterly overwhelmed. My doctor prescribed me 0.5 mg of clonzepam twice a day but I’m only using one 0.5 at night time which I think is a lot better than I was doing. I am being monitored by my family doctor until I can get in with a psychiatrist who has a bit of a wait list. 

I know two people in my life who take clonazepam daily for panic disorders but when I read online about taking clonzepam daily I got really scared. People were saying I would go through trrribls withdrawal if I stop and now I’m terrified. I have reduced my clonzepam use a lot as I mentioned previously but I’m still scared.  My doctor said I might need to take a low dose of clonzepam daily but I’m scared because people said if you use clonzepam for more than 4-6 weeks I will go through horrible withdrawal for 18 months. 

I’m scared now. I feel hopeless. I’ve had dark thoughts about how if this doesn’t get better I don’t want to be here anymore. I know it’s not rational and I am not suicidal to clarify. Just feeling hopeless. 

What’s going to happen to me if I stop taking the 0.5mg at night? Am I going to have terrible withdrawals my brother was prescribed daily clonzepam for severe ocd and he stopped taking it and didn’t seem to have bad withdrawal. 

I feel hopeless a bit because my doctor said she can’t put me on any anxiety medication because it might negstively interact with the bipolar 2 so I have to wait to see a psychiatrist I’m on a wait list for. Is there medications people with bipolar can take to help with anxiety? Is there any hope for me? I feel so hopeless right now no don’t want to live the rest of my life like this. I’ve been to the hospital emergency room like 3 or 4 times in the last month and a half. Without going into detail I have a lot of self created mostly stress and overwhelmed feeling 24/7. The crisis workers all seem to think my panic attacks were triggered by all the stress I’m feeling. And how overwhelmed I feel. I know I’ve made progress from where I was in September but I’m started to get so exhausted and drained from this sick feel like I don’t want to keep going. I just want to give up and not be here anymore. 

I don’t know I’m if I should go back to the hospital inpatient or what. I know people who take clonzepam daily but I’m terrified after what I read. Please help. I take 700mg of quietiapine and 300mg if gabapentin 3x a day.

I can do it no problem on paper but to spit out information of mental math takes me longer. Because I overthink things, I always excelled at writing, I love writing. Math and science have always been tough for me. Maybe it's cause I missed a lot of school, I got placed into special education in 6th grade. I was in normal classes for history and writing, reading comprehension was tough for me but I have ADD. In first grade my mom would send me half days, and I'm sure kids talked.. they probably thought I was abnormal? I don't know. Maybe it's me overthinking. I've had my friends since elementary school so they probably knew something was off with me? I've always been quiet. 

Maybe they weren't talking behind my back, but I don't know if my friends know something and aren't just saying anything? I'm not sure. They talk about kids from high school and how they thought they had LOW IQ. Are they saying this when I'm not there? Is this just my anxiety? I'm a CNA in the hospital, so maybe they think I'm smart? I don't know. I'm so worried they think something is off with me and they are treating me like a friend cause they know? 

I was in special education, so I don't know. I'm very worried about this. I'm 25, and have nothing going for me besides my CNA.
I have issues with money, social anxiety and depression. I think so low of myself, I'm so worried I have low IQ or I'm intellectually disabled. I'm afraid everyone knows and they don't tell me..

I cant stop thinking that its too early to tell or she missed something, or that maybe i didnt explain the pain i was feeling correctly. I am constantly thinking about it, googling it, giving my self exams, taking my temperature,and checking to see if my lymph nodes are swollen. Its seriously getting out of control and i dont know what to do. Everyday i wake up thinking im going to find out that im dying. And i dont want to keep going to the dr about it/get checked for it and make myself look crazy. I am driving my family insane as well constantly talking about it, which makes me feel so guilty for putting them through this.

She has been to inpatient, outpatient, PHP, home school, everything and everyone who has worked with her says the same thing.  They can't help her until she wants help.  But how do you convince a depressed, anxiety ridden, probably neurodiverse 16 year old to take a positive step.

What do I do?  How can we help/support her?  How can we get her to the other side?

For example, she said she doesn't want to work in food service or retail, but she is 16.  There aren't many options available.  We ask her where she wants to work.  She doesn't know.  We break things down for her (do 1 thing today, one tomorrow), it never gets down.  She is unhappy about her weight, but won't go to the gym.  She wants to go to public school, but won't get up or do school work.  She wants a car, but she can't pay the insurance because she can't work.  

We have considered taking away what is valuable to her (the car and her phone) to try to motivate but will that cause even more isolation and depression?

2022-10-26 10:10:41,Anxiety,"I've dealt with health anxiety bullshit since I was 19. MS, ALS, cancer, fibro, brain tumor, fatal familia insomnia, and everything in-between. I'm 35 now, and even though I have more good days than bad, they've been in short order recently. 

It's my ears. I'm terrified that I've develop tinnitus. Granted, I've been a musician most of my life, and didn't take great care of my ears until maybe 10 years ago. But even though I've been told by an ENT that I'm okay, other than some minor hearing loss (drums w/o ear plugs for a long ass time), I'm still hyper aware of anything weird that my ears do. Or don't. 

Last night, I was sitting in my living room at 5 am and it was *dead silent*. As in, that creepy kinda quiet that makes you feel weird. Out of nowhere, I started hearing this nearly deafening roar. As soon as I turned my head to see what was going on, it stopped. I sat there for a moment to try figuring out what happened, and it came back. Cue a panic attack and shit else for sleep the rest of the night. 

It hasn't happened since then. But instances where I'm in complete silence like that are extremely rare. I've been body scanning (ear scanning?) all day too to see if I can make it happen again. Nada.

I have anxiety and take Lexapro 5mg daily and have been fine for 2 years.  2 weeks ago,  I was cleaning my right ear and noticed a speck of blood on it,  coming from behind my tragus. Went on with my day..  later in the day leaving the gas station,  I felt off balance like vertigo,  where I thought I was going to fall over.  Thankfully I didn't.  Got in my car and say there.

Ever since then I have had this off feeling with my head.  Temple pressure on both sides,  basically if I am constantly doing something and turn my head I feel the woozy feel.  Kinda like when you shake your head no really fast and suddenly stop. Occasionally pressure behind my eyes, head pressure all around the head,  jaw pressure on right side.

Saw Dr week ago,  he said my ears looked fine but scribed me some drops.  4 drops 2x a day.  Nothing  has improved.  I am unsure where to look.  I had covid a month ago,  thinking maybe it's a side effect of it.  Or it's just my anxiety making everything worse!!

I take multi vit,  vit d3,  Lexapro,  omeprazole,  dhea every day and all this came out the blue!

2022-10-26 10:08:18,Anxiety,"To give some context I have very bad anxiety, and not fully diagnosed with it but on the fence for OCD according to my shrink. On top of that I have always been high achiever and have imposter syndrome. Anyways I have noticed a pattern where I will join a company, where I will excel and go beyond expectation. But then I will make a minor mistake, which my supervisor will bring it up and from that point on I will just go super “can’t-fuck-this-up-you-stupid-piece-of-shit-why-are-you-so-dumb” mode and end up making more mistakes.

This happened recently and I noticed the pattern. And the thing is most of the time supervisors when they bring up the initial problem, they are super nice. But for some reason my head travel to when I was young getting punished for the smallest mistakes. Yes, I had tough Asian parents who were very demanding to put it lightly. The best way I can explain the situation is I feel like I’m being watched by everyone and I cannot make a simple mistake and then I try to rush things and end up losing my shit like I’m about to have a breakdown and start making more mistakes.

I had a really good time, and we met up again today, and he bought me a plushie and said he can't wait to see me again.

2022-10-26 09:41:36,Anxiety,"I suffer from extreme anxiety problems. Due to these problems, at school whenever there's a lockdown or fire drill I'm warned in advance.

It's always been a fear of mine that one day there'll be a drill that I'm not warned about, a REAL drill.
That has happened.

It wasn't a real lockdown, but I thought it was.
During science class there was the announcement. A hold and secure, or whatever it's called, I'm not really sure. I think it's just a soft lockdown?
Anyways, the whole class gathered in the corner as told. I was already getting panicked. I wasn't told, I wasn't warned, it was real.

Right when people were beginning to go back to their desks, another announcement came, announcing a lockdown.
The warning came repeatedly. ""Warning, initiating lockdown procedure."" Over and over again. Through the whole thing.

I asked my friend to go on their phone so I could text my online friends. Another fear of mine is that I'll die without being able to tell my online friends, leaving them to endlessly wonder what happened to me.

The whole time, I sat there as quietly as I could, trembling, feeling sick, trying not to drop the phone as i frantically typed, trying not to cry.
I really thought I was gonna die.
I was wondering how it would feel,, what would happen, where would I go, what would my friends do, what would my parents do.

And then it was over. It was a drill.
I genuinely believed it was real. I thought i was going to die. 

The moment it ended I burst into tears. I shouted at one of my classmates who asked what was wrong. I feel bad, but I'm too nervous to apologize. I'm not great at talking to people.
It was so embarrassing. 

I went down to the office with my friend who's phone I was using to calm down. I was informed it was a drill they failed to warn me about. 

This was about 9 days ago, and it won't leave my mind.

At school whenever there's an announcement or a sound, I start to shake and feel my heartbeat quicken. Every announcement, every noise, it feels like it's going to happen again. Its not, but I can't stop panicking every time there's any sort of announcement or sound.

Today during English class me, my friend, and their friend went into the room that connects two classrooms to do our work. There was an announcement that we couldn't hear from in the room, but I saw one of my friends pointing towards the room we were in.
I started panicking, heartbeat racing, sweating, shaking. I thought there was another lockdown and they were pointing at the room so everyone could hide in there.
It wasn't. It was just an announcement calling my friend down to the office.

No one else is like this. I think everyone has forgotten it by now.
Awhile ago my friends were mocking me for the anxiety attack,,  joking about it. It isn't funny. I thought i was gonna die.

I feel so fucking pathetic. I should be over it. I can't talk to anyone about it,, if a few certain friends hear that im still scared and thinking about it,, they'll make me feel worse about myself.

I shouldn't be like this. I'm so stupid and pathetic and I hate it.
Is this normal? Has anyone else experienced anything similar to this? Am I crazy? What's wrong with me?

I've never had any pass lockdown-related trauma, though it's always been a fear of mine.

I know this seems like a stupid thing to be so worked up over, it IS a stupid thing to get so worked up over. I wish I could tell my mind to stop, to just forget it ever happened. I wasn't this paranoid before it happened, but now I'm jumping at every noise that comes over that speaker.
The anxiety is even worse when I'm in Science where it happened. I really really wish I could stop thinking about it. 

I just,, want to know if I'm the only one like this.
Am I the ONLY one who gets so anxious and sick and paranoid over a school lockdown without experiencing any past trauma? 
I can't be,,  right?

Is it a valid thing to still be anxious about?
I know nothing actually happened, no one died, no one was harmed, but I really genuinely thought my life was going to end. It felt like the end,, it wasn't, but it felt like it.
And I'm still scared of how soon it could end, how soon another one can happen, a REAL one.

I'm sorry,, this has been on my mind so much,,  I just need somewhere to ask if this is normal,, somewhere to talk about it without being mocked, hopefully.",Extreme anxiety after false lockdown drill at school

2022-10-26 08:14:08,Anxiety,"I have had debilitating somatic anxiety for 15 years (I’m 23 now) it started out when I was a child and I would feel nauseous, then in my teens, after two friends passed in one week, developed somatically and I would experience chronic stomach pain; multiple times daily I would have flare ups so bad I’d have to call ambulances, so I was eventually put on tramadol daily. I was on 6 tramadol a day for 5 months, but managed to come off them by myself. 

At the beginning of last year I started smoking cannabis for reprieve and it worked super well, until I was smoking all day everyday and costing me hundreds per week. After this I had a psychiatric evaluation and was diagnosed with severe ADHD and moderate autism, which wasn’t a surprise as my half siblings and our father has them both too.
Ritalin has worked fabulously without any negative side effects.

My anxiety was still terrible and rapidly declining, so the psychiatrist put me on 2.5mg of clonazepam 2x daily, that psychiatrist ended up ghosting me so I ended up having to go through the public system and they’ve switched me onto the equivalent dosage of diazepam. So I have been on a relatively high dose of benzodiazepines twice a day for almost a year. 
My mental health is rapidly declining and the psychiatrist keeps giving me different meds for my anxiety and major depressive disorder, but I can’t help but feel as though the benzodiazepines are causing my excess anxiety and depression; due to the fact that they stop working after a while and then you need higher doses.  

My team don’t want me to come off the diazepam yet as I’m not in a good mental state, but I just can’t help but think that the benzos are causing majority of the issues.

Do you have any experience or knowledge with this? 
I take two diazepam pills day and night and without telling them I have started to take 1 &amp; 3/4 tablets at night instead of 2 tablets, because I feel like I might not need all of these excess meds if I wasn’t on them.

2022-10-26 08:09:03,Anxiety,"As I read through these posts it’s almost comforting in a sense. Not because people are struggling or uncomfortable, but because it validates that anxiety can be a very real and scary thing for everyone including everyday people. (People that works, have social lives, hobbies, loving people around). I am not saying this to exclude this form people with mental illness the prevents them from living a somewhat normal life, I am just able to relate to a lot of these posts from people that are having panic unannounced. 

Cannabis induced panic (triggering panic from days to years)
Having somatic fears (heart rate and breathing fear and focus) 
Feeling of deep fear or dread because of panic. 
Physical symptoms (sweaty hands, numb face)

I post this to say, you are not alone. Mental illness is scary and there are many ways to deal with it, just be proactive to making yourself better; Medication, exercise, psychotherapy, bloodwork…. Don’t live uncomfortable and let it debilitate you. 

I have had GAD most of my life. A stressful event happened in late teens that left me fearful and in a state of panic for several years a. I didn’t really know what anxiety was until this. I was convinced something was physically wrong with me. I had blood drawn, cardiologist visits, ultrasounds…. Everything was fine. 

I somewhat managed the panic and lived with general anxiety for almost a decade self medicating daily with cannabis and alcohol. Did well at work, was promoted multiple times, great social life surrounded with friends, family, and travel, and functioned somewhat normal at least to the people around me. 

I just recently accepted a new position within my company…. Weeks later, feeling full blown panic, dizzy, heart racing.. just as I remembered as a late teen early 20s.

I started Buspar reluctantly. (Always felt weak or scared of the end result with medication 2 days in and the real terror and panic had subsided. Still a long road to go, but YOU ARE NOT ALONE.",You are not alone….
