2022-11-24 09:18:38,depression,"I feel like I can’t control the bad thoughts when my partner and I have a fight, I don’t know what to do with myself. I feel like sometimes I’m dating someone who only stays with me because I won’t leave, I feel like he doesn’t care about me with the way he talks sometimes. It hurts me until I’m sick to my stomach. I’m tired of crying, he just gets mad when I cry. I don’t know what to do anymore.

Today I asked if he could do the dishes, to which he responded with “why don’t you do them”, idk if anyone else feels this way but I thought that was condescending and it made me mad, so I explained that I had already vacuumed and cleaned most of the rest of the house, and that he had already said he’d do the dishes, to which he replied that I was the one escalating thing and being shitty. Sometimes I’m just tired of being here, but I still love him. I don’t know what to do, I don’t understand why he treats me like this sometimes.

2022-11-24 09:06:23,depression,"New to the group so hi everyone! The last three years have been tough- my now ex-fiancé relapsed hard on fentanyl during the pandemic &amp; it took me a long time to end things, I also financially supported both of us, both of our parents were diagnosed with Cancer, &amp; I was diagnosed with PTSD because of the mental &amp; physical abuse (11 stitches in my head). A lot… I know. 

I moved in with family for a year which was nice but difficult but finally got back on my own feet. I’m working at a bar that is really good financially and I’ve made friends but it’s also cliquish. I’m older (38) than 90% of my work colleagues (including managers) &amp; while I get along with people because I’m the funny gay guy at work I feel like I have very few connections/friends. That’s hard when you don’t really have friends outside of work, your family is not super close though you try hard to be good to them, &amp; your rock (my mom) is always in pain in medicated.

I have my dog &amp; cat but I really feel like I have no one. It’s been two years since my relationship ended &amp; I have a lot of trust issues and am not putting my baggage on someone else.

I used to be SUPER outgoing- going to school, working three bar jobs, &amp; working at bank while having a social life. I discovered pills at 21 &amp; it consumed my life- over seven years clean. I go to meetings for myself, Naranon, &amp; I just don’t know how to socialize. I can fake it at work but my social skills are just embarrassing.

This was a long rant and I’m sorry but maybe someone will see something I say and it will resonate?

But I have this overwhelming feelings of nothingness. I fear I’ve become numb to everything. I feel like I don’t deserve to feel this way as there are many others who have it much worse.

I’m so used to being abandoned, betrayed and used that I just only feel good in very short moments. It’s like a memory. I see what I have, I love it. I have an overwhelming sense of love my gf. I want to protect her, give her everything. But I can’t hold onto them moments. I know I’m safe with her, but time is going by so fast. I can’t grab the good moments between the numbness. 

Work completely absorbs me at times. I hate my job, but it’s necessary. It’s a major trigger of past trauma as well as a direct source of trauma, but I need it to provide and survive. I feel trapped. I’ve thought about quitting for years, but my confidence is shot. I’ll only be taking a pay cuts and the grass isn’t always greener.

2022-11-24 09:04:23,depression,"After my first dog when I was 3 I never wanted another dog because I knew it would have to die one day or it could get sick. After a stay in the hospital recently I decided to get a dog as means of choosing life because I would have to take care of it and I wouldn’t kill myself and leave the dog alone. The dog turned out to have a genetic disease that requires expensive vet and medicine costs monthly for the rest of its life. This is on top of the $4,000 vet bill that I paid for it’s emergency stay. My biggest fear was that it would get sick and it came true. I feel like my life is a fucking joke because I can’t even have a dog. I’m gonna have to give him away or put him down if no one takes him in. That’s why I hate therapy because life can always get worse and you’d have no say.

2022-11-24 08:59:00,depression,"Dad stormed in my room yesterday and I knew right away he is angry.
“Why are you like this? You don’t eat. You don’t want to do anything. What’s wrong with you?”
I explained to him many times before what depression is, I even read an article to him because he refused to research about my illness. Why is he angry? I guess it is my fault for expecting that he’s going to be concerned. He went out and stormed back in and asked:
“What happened to your enrollment? I thought you were going to enroll already”
I told him I was but he said no. He wanted me to attend a big name school but with depression I can only do online classes which no big name school is offering. He used to boast about me being in one of the most prestigious school in the country to his friends. Sorry I won’t be able to boost your ego anymore. Then he proceeded to tell me to enroll in that small school instead as if he has no choice and that he is doing me a favor. How about let me see a psychiatrist? He said no to that too. How about let me live in another house where I won’t have to see his current partner. I live with dad, his current partner, their 3 kids, a cousin who SAed me and calls me stupid every chance she gets, and a grandmother who won’t stop telling me to call my mom.

Backstory:
I have 3 half siblings from my dads current partner(she’s the 3rd). I have an older sister from my dads first partner and she’s here every weekend to call me poor. We have another hidden sister who contacted us. I have one older brother from my moms first partner. I only have one sibling who I share same parents with(but actually we think his dad is my moms ex). So yeah it’s really messy. My dad refuses to be a dad to all of us. I haven’t talked to my mom in such a long time because she would call me names like “gold digger” because I now live with my rich dad. Sorry, I don’t want to beg for my tuition fee again from other people. Dad always sides with his current partner instead of me. Mom said I brainwashed my brother into hating her when my brother has been complaining to me for years that our mom doesn’t even talk to him when they used to live with each other. It sucks to have parents who don’t want to be parents. Dad says my situation isn’t as bad as my older sisters. Aunt says I should be thankful because I am blessed that I have no financial problems so I should set aside my depression and be grateful for the life I have. My dads current partner admitted to my brother that she regrets having kids. Dad admitted to me that the youngest is a mistake. Mom would constantly tell us that she wish she could put us all back in her belly. Both of my parents cheated on each other multiple times. Why do we have to suffer the consequences of her getting pregnant young? Why do we have to suffer the consequences of cheating? Why cant my dad understand why I am depressed when he’s the one who put me in this situation in the first place? What can I do when every time I try to get out my dad says no to my suggestions?",Dad got angry because I was acting like a depressed person…and he’s one of the biggest reasons why I am depressed

All my friends back home are successful and living out the prime of their lives while all I can think about is how much I am rotting.

I have ADHD and have been told I have an addictive personality (which I agree with completely) I have been thinking about this a lot and I can't help it and I've started to completely loathe who I am. I have never been more lonely in my life at uni as I have terrible social awareness. I am asexual and have never been able to form a relationship because of it. I hate how I look and I hate how lonely I am. **I am not thinking about ending my life.** But I'm really scared that this isolation and depression will lead me into alcoholism and addiction which terrifies me. 

I know so many people like me are out there, people who feel so alone when surrounded by people because they have no one to express their thoughts and feelings on to, and then turn into such self hating miserable helpless addicts who have no hope or favour for their future.

2022-11-24 08:06:24,depression,"I wanted to create this post to see if anyone else identifies with the above statement. 

I have suffered from depression since I was around seven years old and I can’t help but think about the person I could have been and the possible achievements or experiences that could have been open to me had my illness not completely consumed me my entire life. Whilst my peers were discovering interests/hobbies and developing their identities, I was trying to just make it through each day at a time. I had very little energy or motivation to pick up anything or really stick at it. My grades at school were usually well below average because I just couldn’t muster up any interest in the subjects or just didn’t see any point in applying myself. I also suspect that my poor mental health stunted the development of social skills and how to make friends. The kids in my neighbourhood were out on adventures and having fun whilst I was at home trying to think of good enough reasons no not end it all. 
I have been on this planet for 38 years now and feel that I have very little to show for it. I have no major achievements to celebrate, no obvious or impressive hobbies to show off, or in-depth knowledge or expertise in a special subject/area. My low self confidence, ADHD, and perfectionist mindset prevented me from giving things a decent chance- I put immense pressure on myself to be perfect and I abandon things if I’m not proficient straight away. I see myself as an incredibly dull and insignificant person as result, and feel ashamed for the waste of several decades. I dread it when people ask me if I have any hobbies or what I do in my spare time. I wish I could play instruments, paint/draw, do craft or DIY projects, play a sport properly, or excelled in an academic subject etc. As I’m approaching forty I feel that I’m too past it to bother trying.
I have been told to not focus so much on the past but I just can’t help but feel robbed of my youth and any potential that I may have had.

2022-11-24 07:16:49,depression,"a couple days ago my best friend overdosed on pills because of an extreme panic attack. he took every pill in his house that he could find beciase of an irrational fear of school. the only thing that stopped him was the fact that he told a different friend what was going on at the time and that friend came to his house and stopped him before he took too much.
my best friend ended up in the hospital where they told him that he might die in the next three days. 
i only heard of this after the whole situation (before he told his mom-who ended up taking him to the hospital), because i randomly texted him something unimportant that happened during my day and after that text he suddenly wrote about the situation which led me to have a complete breakdown. it was the first time i  cried in school, and it was one of the worst feelings ever. 
i can't believe he actually did this. i think im still in shock. i don't want to make the situation about me, but i feel really hurt that he didn't tell me what was going on earlier. he's my best friend, and i thought i was his. we've been through a lot of shit together, and we've always been there for each other. but suddenly something like this happens, and the first person he contacts isn't me. obviously i'm glad that he wrote to someone, becuase he was literally one or two pills from literal death. but the fact that he'd rather text a guy from his class about this and not me really stings. and the worst part is that if the friend didn't show up to stop him then i wouldn't even know that anything happened at all. he would have just died and not even told me what was going on. 
this isn't even the first time a person close to me nearly died because of a pill overdose. i hate these types of situations, but i keep finding myself in them for some reason, and it's really taking a toll on my mental health. i'm only 17, i need a break.

2022-11-24 07:09:53,depression,"Hi Reddit, 

Burner account here but just feel like I need to get stuff off my chest. 

Over the past 6 years I’ve watched my life fall apart. I recently turned 26 and just feel like there’s very little to my life that I actually enjoy. My girlfriend walked away back in May after I gave my all to support her through a difficult period of her life and I neglected my own needs during that. When life started to go to shit I was dropped like I was nothing. I lost my job shortly after, friends and just was left feeling entirely alone. 

I went from being healthy to now gaining stupid amounts of weight, I’m disgusted in myself. On top of all that, I was born with a hip condition that rendered me unable to walk without a serious limp which feeds my insecurities so much more. Whenever someone ever asks me about my leg I always find an excuse rather than share why I have these problems. 

I’ve always been an outsider to my family, the odd kid, different interests, different humour and it hurts because I can’t form a friendship and keep it without being scared I’ll lose it I can’t confine into my family without being told that I’m being ridiculous. My anxiety has blown out of control, my heart always feels like it’s going to collapse at times. I don’t tell anyone and compressing everything I feel is making me worse.  I want things to be better, but I don’t think I’m capable of it anymore. I haven’t got people I trust, my loved ones don’t understand me and I truthfully feel like my fear of being abandoned will prevent me from meeting someone. I could sit here and go on and on but right now these are my thoughts that loop over and over in my head. I’m simply not good enough. I can’t make anyone happy, I let everyone down and I just can’t bare to keep disappointing everyone.

That whole part made me extremely depressed, still now. However my dog had to be put down in 2019, I think it was because I was walking my dog and decided to run with her for fun at the last two mins of the walk but she kept stopping wanting to slow down but I insisted we kept running, when I went to walk in with her at the end of the walk, my neighbours dog came out of nowhere and attacked me and my dog, I remember shouting NO NO NO, I managed to get the dog off her but the dog had bit my dogs ear quite bad and cut my arm, im now convinced that because of that encounter that led to my dog getting an infection and having to be put down, basically making it my fault she died, my other small dog also got attacked on the neck, After that I started drinking heavily and hurting my mum physically trying to get her booze, started stealing from shops to get my booze as I was underage. A year later I watched vanilla sky and was convinced that I had a happy life and so was going to jump off a cliff similar to the ending of the film, around then I started abusing phenibut - a GABAergic euphoric drug, abusi g my sertraline. Also round then we had a parot that suddenly became ill, it was such a nice friendly bird, always landing on our arms, but one night I was in the living room while it was in its cage, and suddenly it somehow broke out its cage and walked through to the living room, limping, so I CRYLINGY picked it up while it was screaming I think because it was scared and I helped it back into its cage, it must have broken out and damaged its wing I think, a day later it died, so sad. Since then I have tried killing myself several times, with police involved and mental hospitals. Fast forward to now I've been using drugs which I won't name but il say was party drugs etc, and my phenibut, on and off extreme withdrawals and putting my mum through hell.

My father was severely physically abusive growing up, and so as much as i care for my mom, i keep contact with my dad to a minimum. Senior year of high school they decided they wanted to move across the country, so naturally i had to follow, to which they decided to move back across the country again, and i was not invited this time. I have a boyfriend (20M), we’ve been together for two years. My best friend unsliced herself around the beginning of our relationship, as well as my aunt whom I was close to passed as well shortly before, so I was processing a lot at the start of our relationship, but I have pretty bad abandonment issues i’m trying to work through. I feel like it’s hard for me to maintain friendships. I’m very much a people pleaser, so much so that I’ve let friend move into my apartment rent free cause I feel bad for not offering. I know it’s pathetic, but I have a hard time not thinking that I would want a dependable friend to do that for me. I first invited a friend which then I found out 5 months in that her and her gf were speaking bad about me behind my back, and then told me I was a selfish and bad person. It made me feel terrible for a while. I recently invited another friend to stay while they adjust to the city I live in, but recently, even today as I prep and deep clean for thanksgiving, told me that I haven’t been considerate of their mental health recently. I had asked for help cooking, baking, and cleaning cause it’s a dinner we’re throwing together, but they slept in until 3, and then said they were never told that they needed to help, and they didn’t like me trying to wake them up.

2022-11-24 05:14:33,depression," 

Title summarizes it for those who don't wanna read. Sorry if post is too messy but I'm just writing anything that comes to my mind coz I feel like I cant breathe. I am 22M, from a developing country. Trying to pursue master's degree in hardest school in my country for the major I study (one of the engineering majors). I finished my bachelor's also here. I have been always competitive academically, getting very high rankings in national exams. This put extreme pressure on me and I studied much harder than my fellows in teenage years. Rarely relaxed. In childhood, I could make friends but starting teenage years I rarely had close friends and I never socialize, do fun stuff. All I remember is sitting at home, spending time on computer or studying. In high school, I had 2 relationships. Second one was more important one, it lasted over 1 year and I really clinged on the girl. Ended up being abandonded as expected. After that, it has been 6 years and I did not have a romantic relationship. I still think about this girl every single day, she is in my dreams in nights. I am obsessed with her obviously, this may or may not be dependent on the fact that I am single, but I think it is an important detail.

As I indicated earlier, the major and school combination I choose is ruined my whole undergad life. Of course I could do better socially, but with covid eating 2 years of these time and me already being an introvert combined with the time I must spend studying, I ended up having a friend circle consisting of nerd engineer anti-social male (like me and majority of the department) and one women friend. I am not sure if the circle I called can be considered as friendship, all we do is go to lectures, do research, talk about courses etc. I can not even get rejected by a girl(only happened once) because I can not get through this stage, no flirting. When I see people outside with their bf/gfs I feel very bad. I crave for attention of a girl so desperately.

I already can not meet women, becacuse of my isolating life style but furthermore, I feel like no girl will ever like me sexually. I hate my looks. I am short, skinny and look like a nerd. Probably women look at me and at the first sight they exclude me from possible boyfriends. I tried going to gym and putting some muscle mass but cannot even manage it. And believe me I tried, it has been more than 1 year I started gym. But this I think is not very crucial part of the whole story. I am aware that I sound so negative, which also puts people away from me. But it's a vicious circle, as I get lonelier I feel more and more sorry for myself.

I could take all of these for whole my undergrad years anyway, graduated with a good GPA but in last two months, I feel more and more depressed. I end up crying whenever I think about these, where my life is going, even such a life has a meaning? I do not think I will do anything bad to myself but thought of it comes from time to time. I can not concentrate on school either, master's is for now going shitty. I went to school's therapist for 5 sessions but she was shockingly plain. She only said anyone can said without a psychology degree. At the end she thought I am OK and ended sessions. However, I do not think I am OK, at least I don't feel that way.

Probably some of the people is going to say find hobbies, school clubs etc. In one of the sports(not quite a physical one), I was in national team and competitive in it from very early childhood. It is also a male-dominated area. And as I put most of my free time on it, I could not develop any hobbies other than it and do not know where to start.

So what do you suggest?","No relationship for 6 years, social anxiety, very isolating anti-social career/ school path. I can't take it anymore."

2022-11-24 04:50:53,depression,"It’s my day off work alone and I’m just sitting in my room doing nothing feeling very depressed. The only days I’m really happy is when I’m with my partner. As soon as he left for work today my depression is almost immediate. 

It’s crazy because I use to be single and thought I’d be alone forever. I would choose to have no friends, all my free time would be spent watching movies, tv, and playing video games. And I was actually happy lol. I could really enjoy my time alone and have fun playing a video game or watching a really good movie. 

Now today on my day off I’m alone again. But I can’t seem to be happy doing any of those things. If I play a game I feel unproductive. I’m just depressed thinking about so many things I never use to have to worry about when I was alone. Living alone. 

I always feel like I’m being judged and I’m a loser because I don’t have a high paying career but my partner does. I feel judged from his family. I feel like a loser. My social anxiety is increased because I have no privacy anymore at home because my partners mother and sister live with us. I can never play music loud, I have to worry about how loud I talk because the walls are paper thin, and I can never just go down and grab food like snacks without feeling worried about the sister being in the kitchen. 

I wish I didn’t constantly worry about these things but I do. I have severe social anxiety and mental issues stemming from being sexually and physically abused as a child. 

I’m just so depressed all the time now and I feel so worthless. I constantly have suicidal thoughts. If I knew of an easy 100% pain free way to do it I would have already.

I’m tired of worrying about so many social situations that I never had to before. 

I can’t even enjoy myself on this day off. I can’t watch a movie of play a game because I feel worthless and like shit doing it. Yet I feel worthless and like shit doing nothing else but sitting in bed either. 

I’m so tired and stressed all the time. I have no motivation. I know so much would improve if I was single again but also I love my partner so I’d rather die than live without him.

2022-11-24 04:32:37,depression,"I don´t even know where to start. Short Version is, I (m24) sort of fucked up my life and I can´t really blame anyone but myself.
 
I have been depressed since I was 16 years old (at least that´s what I think) coupled with massive self-esteem issues and anxiety at times. I have some guys I´m friendly with, but at best one or two real friends, also single since forever (not at all an incel, just no self esteem/experience at all).

Started studying mechanical engineering at 19 (mistake) and should have finished in like 3 to 4 years. 5 years later, I even finished with my Bachelor´s Thesis and only need to finish 6 more exams and I failed them. Those were my last attempts to pass these tests (you get 3 for each exam) which basically means I´m kicked out of my study.

I more or less wasted 5 years of my early adult life without experiencing anything, I even skipped holydays with my parents for uni, and now I don´t even have anything to show for it.
I mostly wasn´t motivated because I couldn´t imagine a happy future for me out of my degree so I didn´t try as hard as I could and wasted time doing nothing instead of studying.

Although I wouldn´t really mind if I die in an accident or from an illness, I wouldn´t really say im suicidal. I´m too afraid of death right now and there are still things in the future I´d like to see and I don´t wanna traumatize my siblings.

2022-11-24 04:26:16,depression,"One day that feels like getting out of bed wasn't a mistake. I've managed to luck my way into basically having no responsibilities all day for way too long of a time now, and that can probably last for a while still. I have all day to do whatever I think is best, but I still somehow always regret getting out of bed, wishing I could just curl up under a rock and never leave. Instead I end up working out for most of the day and just finding something to watch for the rest of it. Exercising is starting to feel harmful to my mentality because it feels like a paradox. I can feel muscles growing everywhere and workouts getting easier or faster, but you can't see any of it. I look the exact same as I did two months ago when I was twenty pounds heavier. Even that statement, ""I've lost twenty pounds in two months"", should make me feel better, but it doesn't. Not only can you not see that that ever happened, but recently I've been gaining it back with no changes to my how I was eating while I was losing it. My time spent not working out is always full of internal conflict. Thinking about doing important stuff stresses me out until I feel my core go ice cold and I start thinking about each and every way it will go wrong. Hobby like activities seem like a good distraction up until I actually start doing something and I just feel like I'm wasting time which starts dragging me down even more. Interacting with family and friends always ends with me feeling worse than before. I always have to be the one to start an interaction with each group of people, even those that never met all do the same thing, so it's probably just me. I didn't even get acknowledged by random internet strangers in general on international men's day, let alone for the day at all. I imagine in the past few years, unless I saw them on a daily basis, I would be contacted maybe once in a month, and that's only getting less frequent. When I do actually interact with people, things usually go wrong somehow. Either things get misunderstood along the way somehow or it just turns into a neutral conversation neither of us want to keep up. At this point I pretty much just have no desire interact with anyone I know except for one person and my cat. I can't even see my cat as much as I want to. He's getting older and walking is getting harder for him so he spends pretty much all of his time on his own couch in my living room, which means that most of the time if I wanted to pet him I'd have to interact with family that will say some inane bullshit and drive me more insane. The one person I want to interact with has been growing more and more distant, while the sparse interactions we do have all have intentions of wanting the opposite, it's a constant shifting feeling of the warmest warmth to distant colds. I always have a feeling like I should be doing something that I feel is actively helpful to me, right now either exercising or progressing through big life plans, or else I just get a feeling of numbing emptiness. The only thing that's been able to help pass time like that is just watching something and thinking about it. Even then though, I can't watch something too boring or I'll start thinking of everything else and I can't watch something too interesting because I'll be constantly thinking about talking about it to the one person I want to interact with. Things always feel a little bit easier whenever I'm alone, which isn't often since I live with family. When they're home it's like I just want to shut down and make absolutely no noise at all so they don't try to interact with me. When I do get time alone, I usually fill that time with odd things I feel mentally better doing when I'm alone rather than purely relaxing things. There's always a hint of worrying about when time to myself will end as well, every car door closing outside has me mentally preparing to be annoyed. Obviously there are solutions to some of these, like working and moving out, but it'll just be replacing old problems with new ones and it would still take time to change. I don't know if I could make it very long choosing to spend eight hours a day or more doing something I don't want to do at all just to clock out and still be in a horrible mental situation. Whenever I try to do things to help they never seem to go right, things like working out are starting to feel pointless, any activity I do just to feign positivity end up working backwards. None of this is new to me, it's been like this for a while, so long that I doubt my life will ever actually be in a good direction, it will always just feel like it could be but really isn't. Even though I don't and will probably never deserve it and things probably never will, I just want to be held and told the everything will be ok.",I just want one day

My parents are so incompatible. They're like oil and water. Unsurprisingly..they bicker. Constantly. It affected me A LOT as a child and it affects me even now. They're not necessarily bad people, and they don't even hate each other, they just don't know how to communicate and end up bringing out the worst in each other.  My mom regrets marrying him..says stuff like, ""if I'd known he was gonna be this way I'd have never married him"". One of the reasons my father and I don't get along is that I hate the way he treats my mom. Tbh I hate them together. I hate being a family. I've mentioned this to my mom once or twice during arguments. She was hurt (understandably). I love my mom, but what did she expect..? 

I'm an only child. Chronically depressed and suicidal (due to multiple reasons, mainly because I've struggled to figure life out I guess). Don't have a lot of friends because I suck at keeping in touch. I wouldn't say I'm ""lonely"". I am kinda picky with people I let in. But yeah sometimes I wish I had someone to hang out with.

So all this considered, I feel like I shouldn't exist. Like I shouldn't have been conceived or born. Life has always been an uphill battle for me. I've tried to do everything right with my life but things just don't seem to work out. My existence feels wrong. It always has. And I worry I'll self-sabotage to the point where I'll leave myself with just one option.  I know I have my own flaws (and I haven't included so many details of my life), but I think my depression and anxiety mostly stem from family issues. 

I'm just venting but if you read this whole post thanks a lot I appreciate it. ❤️",I shouldn't exist.
2022-11-24 03:56:35,depression,"I just feel so overwhelmed right now. I have for awhile actually. I hate my marriage… we haven’t been happy in years. I’ve begged for a divorce or for him to move out and he refuses and would rather me leave with all the kids and lose everything we own. I don’t have much family support as my dad got heavy into alcohol and is very angry all the time. We moved 7 hours from all my friends and family anyway, so I never have a break to go visit with anyone when I’m upset. My husband is just so mean and lazy. And any time something happens it’s me who has to figure it out. In the last year I’ve had to take out and max out 5 credit cards just to pay bills because he won’t hold a job. Every bill we’ve been short on, every popped tire, car repair, house repair, kids clothes, school supplies, birthday presents, christmases.. it’s always been on me. I was working up until I had my most recent baby who is 10 months old. Worked through all my pregnancies. I have other kids and I just feel like my husband does not like kids at all and it breaks my heart for my kids I feel like I’m ruining their life because I can’t give them a good dad. I want to start working again just to get out of the house and make more money because I put myself through college and could have  a decent job in the oilfield. College started first as a single mom of 2 under 2 and then through two more pregnancies after I got married. No one believed in me. No one cheered me on or rooted for me. Everyone told me I wouldn’t be able to do it and why bother and my life was already over because I have kids. I graduated top 10% of my college with a 3.63/4 gpa. My husband still thinks I’m stupid or something. I just really wish things were different. I feel like he has done nothing but set me back in all aspects of life. I wanted to go to college so we didn’t live in poverty forever but every time I take one step forward he pushes me back ten more. I can’t afford child care to start working and I don’t trust him to stay home with the kids because at times he can be too rough. His own mom called cps and the cops on him for spanking our son too hard where it left a welt. I’m always made to feel like the bad guy from his side of the family too because I’ve asked him for a divorce numerous times because he spent 2 years saying he didn’t love me but I’m the bad guy for wanting better for myself and my children. I just feel so stuck and I don’t know what to do anymore. We’re supposed to be buying this house next year (rent to own agreement) but I don’t even want to anymore I don’t want myself tied to him even more. Some times I really want to die but I can’t bare the thought of leaving my two youngest in his care (my older 2 have a different dad who’s good to them). He doesn’t care we don’t have money for bills let alone Christmas. He got a really good job making more then he was anywhere else and worked block schedule so only 3-4 days a week and he was constantly calling in, until he lost that job, that’s not what I want for my life. That’s not the example I want set for my children. If I’m going to be married I want it to be a partnership, I want help, I want someone willing to fix things when they go wrong. Not someone watching me prep and make dinner with two kids sitting at my feet and when I ask him if he heard what one of the littles said because it was cute I get yelled at. My oldest kid used to be the sweetest funniest kid ever and now he’s mean and disrespectful and I know it’s because of how my husband treats us. I know he’s hurting. I feel like I’m messing my own kid up and it breaks my heart but I have no where else to go, not with 4 kids. I just want to go back in time. The only good thing that came out of my marriage was my 3 year old and 10 month old. I just don’t even know what to do anymore, everything is a fight and my heart can’t take it.",I just need to vent…

2022-11-24 03:36:33,depression,"Hi, I am not to sure how to start this besides saying I'm literally at wits end with life completely.
I feel so detached from life as a whole. I'm stuck in a very very deep hole. I am unable to get better mentally because my inability to interact with others and social anxieties keep me from trying to get any form of therapy or help. The stuff I have tried ie online therapy services etc. Usually are very limited and heighten the fear that people just dont listen to me when I explain the problems. Friends and family I talk with anymore either think its all a joke, that its all for attention, or if they do think im serious when it comes to making ""jokes"" about not wanting to live anymore they offer help but after so long they give up on helping me because I show no signs of getting better so I feel to them as a lost cause, this has happened to me time and time again. I do not know what to do anymore, im afraid to make new friends or socialize with the friends i have fearing that if they try to help or get to close they will either want out or cut ties. So now i just feel stuck in my own head space adbiding by what my anxious needs tell me to do, but only that is carrying me so far, the methods of coping i have been using for years like video games or music are just starting to not work and increase the numbness. I cant play games for more than an hour at most anymore and all my music is starting to get bland and uninteresting. I am stuck in a shitty cycle of anxiety and suicidal thoughts at work then coming home on my time off feeling like a waste of space, numbness, and suicidal. I do and dont know how to break from this cycle. I know my only way out might be therapy or medication, but im almost never able to do things alone anymore and my friends and family think im fine and functioning on my own. i also have a large feeling of uncertainty with medical help because it sounds too good to be true especially for how long ive been like this. Everyone is the happiest theyve ever been and i dont want to ruin their happiness with my problems. I hope this makes sense, i forget alot of the issues when i start explaining them out in the moment but this is mostly what ive been going through. im sorry in advance. Blegh.",I am at a loss for it all.

You know something's wrong when even youe family despise you. Nobody cares about me. My only ""friends"" come to me when they need something. They always try to bring me down and make fun of me. I do nothing all day but cry. Tried calling the suicide hotline, got ignored. Tried different medications, none of them made a fucking difference. I just got done writing a will and I think I'll snap sooner or later. I have two plans to kill myself and I will execute one of them tonight.

2022-11-24 03:31:47,depression,"i'm on here because i've seen reddit posts and I just want to know if I'm alone in what I'm feeling.

I am a female in my mid 20s with a full time corporate job. I was diagnosed with depression about 4 years ago and am on meds for this. Around 5 months ago, (and I don't know what the trigger was) my depression started to take a downwards spiral. Up to the point where every single morning I struggle to get out of bed, I struggle to do normal things like working, eating, having a shower. And I was never this person, even at the start of the year. Work to me is something I will always do no matter what. But lately it's as if I just can't anymore, it takes all the energy I have to not try and go back to sleep, and even after I sleep for a bit and I wake up, the feelings are still the same. It's as if my body and mind is so tired from just living. Even being awake every day is exhausting. There are times where I chalk it up to me being 'lazy' but now I know its not. I spoke to my therapist and she upped my dosage, but I dont feel a difference. I know medicine is not going to cure my depression but I thought it'll at least help it a bit. I just don't know what to do anymore. Like I HAVE to work, to earn a living and I know this, but I physically and mentally cannot bring myself to do the small things in life let alone put all my energy into my work like I used to. And I don't understand what is wrong with me?

How do I get myself out of this?",Depression while working
2022-11-24 03:30:31,depression,"All my life I've been pathetic and ugly.

I was born with plagiocephaly (a condition where one side of my head is flattened) and for whatever reason, my parents and doctor did not seem to think it was a problem. Well, look at me now! I look like a fucking monster. People have subtly and not so subtly told me that I was ugly all my life. Do you know how much that hurts? Wanting so badly to look good and putting in A LOT of effort to look good only to look in the mirror and realize how useless all the work you put in was. I've invested in skin care, worked out, and tried out new hairstyles but it's just futile. Whenever I try to tell anyone about this they'll undermine my insecurities and insist that they do not matter. Well it certainly matters when people treat you like dog shit and ignore your existence just because of the way you look.

I failed in every single thing I tried in my life. I am not a good student, in fact, I am currently struggling in college right now. I have no talents. I am a fucking idiot (people make sure I know). 

I'm also unlovable. Friends have left me before. My ex treated me like an option and ruined my confidence.

I don't want to live anymore. I want to die. But before I do so can anyone please be there for me? You don't have to give me good advice, just tell me that you care so that at least I will leave the world knowing someone gives a shit.",I feel like I was created to make other people feel better about themselves
2022-11-24 03:29:33,depression,"I don’t know what it is but it always feels like something is blocking me from having a good life. I went to school to be an electrician just to have my car break down on me at the interview. I’ve been diagnosed with osteoarthritis at the age of 22 and my knees are already pretty much screwed. I tried learning IT related skills and joined a cloud boot camp. Things could have went right. But when it came time to take the aws ccp exam i got a fever a few days before and spilled juice all over my laptop in my sleep and even with logging in with my sisters laptop to take it at 1pm , it turned out the exam was actually at  1am(who takes an exam at 1 am?!?!) I come from a not so wealthy background, never had much. Now I feel like I just wasn’t meant to have much. I question how god could let this happen sometimes and that if he existed he has to hate me. The only thing consistent in my life is pain and suffering. It’s a joke at this point. Nothing is easy for me. I don’t know what I’m supposed to do , everything I try at I fail. I can’t do anything right. I’m seriously contemplating if this life is even worth it if I’m doomed to live it as a screw up for the rest of my life.  I tried the construction route the fast food route the warehouse route the IT route , nothing seems to work, if I could just check out of life right now by powering off I would.

Nobody cares, nobody can help n if i try n look for help i just feel worse afterwards.

The person i love basically just ignored me, to listen to the johnny depp case. I just want it all to end, the only thing keepin me from it, is the lack of money to pay for my funeral, cuz i don’t want to put my relatives in even more debt, cuz i don’t wanna ruin their retirement. I tried getting help, but their just ain’t no chance, cuz it’s just me cramping up n not saying a single word to them cuz it’s just like having flashbacks of every bad moment in my life at once, making me want to end it even more, after having talked to anyone about my horribly bad feelings of pain.

2022-11-24 03:26:18,depression,"I don’t mean to say all disabled life isn’t worth living. But I was the happiest person in the world before I became sick. You could not find a person more grateful to be alive then me. 

Got diagnosed with a severe case of ulcerative colitis. If you don’t know what UC is, well I have u uncontrollable bloody diarrhea up to 20 times a day which stops me from leaving the house and takes away all my Energy, no medicines on the market are helping and the only option is surgery to get an ostomy bag, which at that point I’d kill myself.

2022-11-24 03:09:37,depression,"For the past few days I’ve been cleaning my depression nest and it’s been exhausting. 

I don’t feel joy in the things I normally love. I can barely taste food and it’s been hard to eat. I’ve had a few moments I just laid on the floor because my heart was beating like crazy and I felt too exhausted to move. I’ve turned off almost all of my notifications and haven’t picked up the phone if anyone called. Whenever my boyfriend texts I have difficulty replying. I can barely think normal thoughts because the depressive intrusive thoughts take right over and causes a panic attack or a crying fit in minutes. To prevent that from happening I pacify myself watching youtube videos, playing mobile games or scrolling reddit. Sometimes I lose track of time and I realise I’ve been wasting time on my phone for hours. Then I feel guilty and hate myself.

2022-11-24 03:04:30,depression,"A month ago I experienced the first seizure I've ever had (a tonic clonic), and next to it being the most terrifying thing to ever happen in my life, I couldn't turn to anyone for any sort of comfort/support, because I'm alone. A couple days after that, I ended up catching Covid for the first time, and despite how badly it ravaged my already weakened mind/body, I still couldn't turn to anyone for any sort of comfort/support, because I'm alone. And in the same week that both of these awful things happened, my birthday also took place, but nobody noticed or cared, because I'm alone. For weeks afterwards I suffered terribly from long Covid and additional seizures of the focal variety, and throughout it all, I could only lay there, arms wrapped around my own body, whispering whatever little comfort I could give to myself, like a man freezing in the dark clinging to a tattered blanket for warmth. 

In the past, I used to have a couple people I spoke with online, but depression and the assortment of other mental illnesses I suffer from made me isolate myself completely. I've never had any IRL friends. 

Now, after everything that's happened to me this past month, I feel like I'm scrambling all at once to try and reach out to other people, and I'm glad to say that I've met a couple nice individuals this way, but they can only talk to me so much, and for most of the day I just sit completely alone in my room, lonely and scared like I've never been before. What's worse though, is how the more I need other people, the more that pushes them away. I don't want to be a buzzkill, or desperate, or clingy, or needy, but it's really hard not to be when you're in a crisis, yet regardless that doesn't make it any less repellent.   

If I were a normal person, unburdened by chronic depression, I could've at least had good friends and a loving partner to help me through this whole ordeal, but instead I've had to largely go through it alone. Because I've always been so depressed and neurotic, I haven't had the ability to form any sort of connections to other people. This right here is the worst trap life can set for you, since once a crisis hits you, especially of the medical variety, you have no one else other than yourself to see you through it, and let me tell you, that just isn't enough.

**TL;DR:** Depression destroys your ability to make meaningful connections with others, which in turn sets you up for a nightmarish future when you have to cope with major emergencies completely on your own.","Life is unbearable if you have no partner or friends, especially when you're physically sick on top of being depressed."

2022-11-23 15:31:04,depression,"I am 27, male. When i was a kid I hated school. I liked home a lot. I studied in college for 2 years, couldn't wait to leave there. That place sucks for me. Almost everyone there are the same thus socialization for them is not a problem. But it doesn't let me be myself. The reason maybe is I came from another town and that there's a culture difference. 

I was an average guy at school, quiet, i can't fit anywhere. I am funny and friendly at times tho. I'm known the best in the class in our major. But look at me. I haven't even found any position yet. 

The pandemic start. Best year ever. Everyone is staying at home. Everything is online. My friend (older than me) wants to continue college found a scholarship school (our church school) and included me in his plans so we enrolled to get a degree. 


It was an online class and I was occupied. I am distracted from my emotions. It was full of activities and because our church owned the school getting to know some people is not a problem. Was elected as one of the class officers (cuz damn i took it seriously). I had friends i am comfortable with. I can't be judged. Almost everyone thinks the same. I also managed to be one of the Dean's Lister as well.  And i don't get to pay that much compared to any nearby school.

But it has to end. I need to decide weather to move out and continue my scholarship or continue somewhere else. Couldn't decide quickly if i have to leave and for some reason i am afraid to decide. I decided not to think too much about it until it was late.

I can go back to that scholarship school tho but i just have to wait for the next academic year (because i got late for enrollment). I started considering waiting and be back at school again.. but then my insecurities kicked in (at the very right fucking moment). I suddenly felt way too old to start again, then i started feeling ugly for f2f class. Suddenly got socially anxious about the school setup. And im 1 year behind. 

I made some good friends there. But I'm back to old ways now. And this time it's worst than i expected. loneliness creeped in like i never had before. Depressed, Unmotivated.",I've missed an opportunity
2022-11-23 15:28:44,depression,"Insecurities are killing me. All my school years, I was bullied and embarrassed by teachers and that ruined my personality and I hate a lot of things, including the possibility of my being a student again because I have speech blocks, I completely shut down if I'm in a classroom scenario. I'm trying to work on getting my higher studies (even if I have a number of other qualifications, it doesn't matter in this part of the world I live in, because a degree is what makes you a qualified individual), everything requires money and institutions  always run behind money. 

I feel trapped and stagnant, I'm unable to think ahead about my future because this 'lack-of-a-particular-qualification' makes me feel insecure, frustrated and I see no future without it. 

'Education is everyone's right' is not really a thing as only the ones who have money or the ones who are exceptionally intelligent are privileged enough to make it work.

For the past month, I’ve been able to get down to 50 mg without too many side effects, so now I’m trying to taper off from 50 to 25 mg per my psychiatrist’s recommendation. It’s been incredibly hard. For some reason dropping down to 25 mg makes me feel detached from my own body and have massive brain fog. I went back up to 50 mg and felt fine again. I wanted to see if going cold turkey would be better than going down to 25 mg (obvs not a good idea since these kinds of things should be discussed with the doctor). Strangely, I felt better going cold turkey than dropping down to 25 mg…for a week. I then started having the worst migraines and ringing in my ears. It was unbearable. I tried taking 200 mg of SAM-e to see if maybe it was my brain reacting to the serotonin “drop” (again, not recommended since these should be discussed with a doctor).

2022-11-23 14:23:09,depression,"Hi everyone. Apologies if this post is not allowed; I wasn’t sure where the best place to ask this is. This may be long but I’ll try to keep it as short as possible.

I (21) have one sibling (23). I will call them Alex. Alex and I grew up in a very religious Asian household. And for as long as I can remember, they have been super sad. We recently found their diary from kindergarten, and Alex wrote about feeling overwhelmed by life and not wanting to be here. Our family does have some mental health history (cousin committed suicide, some other family members may be depressed). Alex never received professional help due to our parents’ religious views, and also because we didn’t realize how severe their sadness was. When they entered college ~5 years ago, things got really bad. They really hate themself and sometimes talked about committing suicide. They started using drugs and such on a regular basis (weed, cocaine, mdma, alcohol, etc.) but still exceeded in school. They also would have panic attacks and hurt themself. Throughout the last year, I begged Alex to seek professional help and offered to research everything/make the appointments/etc. But Alex felt too exhausted to even try. I ended up also attending college nearby and now live ~20 min away. I’m really scared to move away in case anything happens. Finally, one year ago, after a major depressive episode, Alex found a psychiatrist and was formally diagnosed with bipolar disorder, severe depression, anxiety, and ADHD. My parents, by the way, grew a lot during this time period and also really encouraged Alex to get professional help. We all supported Alex and the diagnosis made sense to all of us. After taking medication for a few months, things seemed to get better. Alex has a really good job that they enjoy, have more close friends than before, and now have a much happier and healthier relationship with me and our parents. They said they felt happier and no longer thought about suicide. What felt like 10+ years of constant depression finally seemed to fade. I was so happy for Alex. I cannot even begin to imagine how difficult things have been for them. However, Alex’s romantic relationship ended last week on a pretty bad note. Their mental health really took a toll and just yesterday, they brought up that they tried committing suicide last week (by asking strangers on the street for fentanyl and heroine to overdose but couldn’t find any). They also rolled on MDMA three times within one week (the suggested timeframe for a break in-between is 2-3 months). They also have been smoking cigarettes daily (they never used to smoke regularly until about 2-3 months ago). Alex also gets high everyday and when they go out with friends (2-3 times a week), they sometimes find horse tranquilizer or cocaine, all on top of their usual weed/alcohol/nicotine. This is all very concerning to me because I know they are in an unstable place. I invited Alex over and they stayed with me for 4 days. Alex said they still want to die but never will, because they don’t want to hurt me or my parents. After a day or two, Alex seemed to be feeling better but they are still using a lot of drugs. When I try talking to them about it, they get a bit defensive and I feel like I’m acting too authoritative. They said it helps them forget their pain. I don’t want to lose Alex’s trust, but I made it clear that I do not support them taking ecstasy so often, alongside smoking so much, because of their health and well-being. I’m super concerned and I don’t know if I’m overreacting. I plan to push them more into trying therapy, other healthy alternatives such as exercise to hopefully help with stress, etc. Does anyone have any advice? I love Alex more than anybody else in this world and I am just really scared. I’m going to bed soon but will respond to any comments in the morning. Thank you so much.",Am I worrying too much about my sibling?

I'd break my back trying to explain and lay everything out, but there's no point. I keep convincing myself there is, but there isn't. No one wants to read an essay. And none of it is fixable, and nobody besides me can grasp their intensity. It's only ever going to seem trivial in everyone else's eyes.

I've now been clouded with these invulnerable problems long enough to go numb. The cowardice may never go away, rendering me unable to exit. So I guess that's it, life wins.

This is my life. I get it now. The idea of things changing for the ""better"" is a bygone concept. A disillusioned and juvenile thought carried from childhood. And the idea of me getting through my problems with art and envy is just flat out fucking stupid.

Apparently, this is the idea of a ""good"" ending to most people. Apparently, this is a better alternative to just dying now and letting the suffering come to an end, when it won't improve anyways.

I started to realize last week when I started to see the tweets she posted before I met her. I really showed her my sentimental side and kind of relayed on her these last weeks.

But i just started to feel this sense of guiltness, uselessness, and abrupt sadness in my life. Cant really go like 2 hours without having the thought of she cheating on me and I cry for an incredibly long time, enough was enough last week when I had to spend like 30 minutes crying in my college restrooms.

2022-11-23 13:44:48,depression,"Life has never been easy for me, when I was 4 a closet broke all the bones in my body but I survived. Surprisingly I was only left with 1 scar on my upper lip (some amazing doctors in Boston saved my life, and reconstructed everything the best they could). Fast forwarding to the future (because I have trouble remembering my past) I moved to Ga at 9 yrs old. Always moving time and time again. …for someone as anti-social as me, when you find those friends that share the same sense of humor and personality as you, u just don’t wanna lose them. Anyway… from elementary school all the way to my last year of middle school I’ve been bullied nonstop because of my top lip scar and because I was so skinny I couldn’t defend myself. Slightly even traumatized to bother hitting on girls because of the bullying back then (they were evil… even if I avoided them). But I definitely made good friends that distracted me from my miserable life nd fear of bumping into bullies so it wasn’t too bad. That summer before highschool I had an insane drive to work out and beat tf out of anyone who tried to bully the “new” me. Halfway through my first year of highschool all of my friends noticed how much muscle I gained (still kinda skinny tho). They’d say stuff like “buff ass nigga” and other random stuff that boosted my moral… made me glad ppl noticed what I couldn’t. No one ever even tried to mess with me my two years of highschool (even tho I had so much hate, I wanted someone to try). I was starting to have a normal highschool life, building different relationships, working on my social skills…(I dreamed of getting a gf before graduating) then BOOM. Everything went downhill.
My mom who was fighting her own demons, and didn’t show us much attention back then finally found 2 ppl worth dating. She told me “one guy has a lot of money, and one guy is really kind and loves me” I told her to “date someone who u love, and who loves You! Because I want you to be happy” then Covid happened. After meeting the guy Me and my brothers were forced to to move 30 min away from everyone we know. If it makes mom happy 😀 right? I love her as a “mom”but she’s manipulative and controlling. Told us it was temporary 2 yrs ago nd we’re still living here. Did two years of online school with shitty grades, barber fucked up my long hair so bad I had to cut it all off, boring ass family never wants to go anywhere, I couldn’t go anywhere because I’m not as blessed as some kids, that accident years ago made me grow 9 extra teeth in my gums and when I was scheduled to remove it I passed out and almost died (this year… I won’t get into that because this is already too long… but I got some new scars). I graduated this year and wanted to plan a vacation trip because life has been hell, obviously can’t go by myself so I used my step brother and sister to plan the trip. Me and my blood brother had our money saved but the step siblings fucked up The plans and went on their own vacation with their relatives. I said fuck it… maybe I haven’t deserved a vacation. Currently on the grind for a car, took and failed a stressful class to get my real estate license (I’ll try again in the future). And right now my mom got me signing up to be a plane aviation mechanic with my older brother. I watched and helped my brother enjoy tf of his highschool life. And those are the friends and girls he has now. I don’t have those distractions  in my already miserable life. Taking such a big step when I’m at my lowest is gonna kill me. If I end up graduating this 2 year school I’m cutting off my family and moving out. I have so much hate for my mom deep down and jealousy for my older brother…can’t help it. Im so tired of getting the short end of the stick… like wtf did I do. But life isn’t fair whatever. I already did 2yrs of hell what’s 2 more. Just put the mask in my face and keep pushing 😁.

2022-11-23 13:19:30,depression,"I have persevered more than typical adults, consecutively since I can remember. I force my self to maintain a semi-respectable daily routine  But I fall short at jobs every time and I don’t know what to do anymore. Jobless since june/2021 .

Everyday comes w new struggles negative outlooks. Thus forcing my mind to tremain empt as to avoid anxiety attacks as well. These small tidbits are not even a chip off the n iceberg. 

I have never had an issue finding and getting jobs in the past. 

Hitting Rock bottom is not the the end “only
Up from here” nope! I’ve been hurtling through the Abyss for a few years now but my mental health is under control but yet I still can not maintain the standards for jobs as I am slow, ADHD combined type, sleep disorders, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, major depressive disorder and then quite a few physical issues as well which came from not having insurance for so many years but also the stress day after day year after year. 

I have no clue how I’m going to pay any of my bills at the bare minimum. I’d also like to actually enjoy life some how. Financial security and freedom. 
 
I have not many friends. 2 to be exact both don’t live close.

2022-11-23 13:16:20,depression,"This is my first time posting here but I wanted to get advice. I honestly do like myself. I believe I have achieved a lot in my years on earth and I’ve even indulged in my own passions with great success. From how my mind perceives the people around me, they always seem pleased to be around me. In their eyes I’m the tall, kind, comedic guy who never has anything bad to say. Someone who they trust in or come to for a good laugh. And I love that. I am a people pleaser. I don’t do it out of selfish reasons. I just love making people happy. But in my time alone my reflections really take a toll on me. I don’t want to self diagnose myself, but I have had therapists recommend that I get a diagnosis for either ADHD/OCD/Or Both because my symptoms are so strong. I am great at hiding my feelings. I am great at hiding my OCD ticks. But I can’t hide them from my mind. They are so frequent throughout my daily life that it is exhausting and even more exhausting to try and hide them to be normal. Constantly having to do random mental rituals to avoid my anxiety triggers prevents me from focusing on my job, school, the army, my friends, family. My mind will tell me to do things I don’t want to do to prevent negative consequences and the fear makes me do it despite me not wanting to. No one in my life seems to take OCD or ADHD seriously which is depressing because when it is strong it is a truly terrifying experience. My mind often takes priority over others when it comes to my OCD/ADHD problems. I’m dealing with trauma of being sexually assaulted, army experiences, and poor family relationships, and it gets so hard to move on and just be content. I am thankful for my opportunities and achievements but I would go crazy continuing my life this way for years. I don’t see the point of living. I don’t want to die. But this lack of a purpose has been driving me nuts. I want to be better than what I currently am and what my family laid out for me. Sorry for the long vent. I just realized that scary thought about not caring for my life anymore today, and I hate that negative trajectory. I just remember the kid I was, who was in love with cinema and used to create these films to show in class and I was so proud of them. I felt that I had a purpose and it’s depressing that I don’t feel the same way about life.",Scary thought today

2022-11-23 13:02:42,depression,"I wrote this after my girlfriend broke up with me. She was my anti-depressant. More-so than the Fluoxetine I was being prescribed. I wrote this at 3 am on a Monday morning after breaking a 10 month&gt;! self harm !&lt;sober streak and considering the extent that I valued my life. It was written in one sitting, without stopping, without music, without feeling. The second half of it was lost due to some file corruption, but I was able to recover this section of it. I don't know if this is bad enough to put a ""Discretion Advised"" warning but, it is advised.  


  


 I sit up at night, every night, thinking of a reason to continue breathing. I lack the capability to speak openly about my feelings and therefore let them compound in my own mind until they become too much and I can't help but cut into myself like a butcher. I've made 2 attempts on my life, the most recent of which being in March of 2021, and I regret saving myself that night frequently. Every breath feels like the weight of a thousand people standing on me and I don't care for anything or anyone around me. I moved past the stage of guilt keeping me alive, not wanting people to be upset over my passing, and instead convinced myself they didn't need me around and that I, more commonly than not, am the problem. Nothing has changed in my life for years, I do the same things, live in the same place, go to the same places, have the same problems, the same feelings, the same everything. Nothing changes with every coming day and I am beyond bored with my existence. Waking up in the morning is more of a burden than a gift, and I wonder why I didn't just end it all the night before like I wanted to. Everytime I enjoy something it feels foreign and strange. I find such comfort in my own sadness that not having it be my present feeling is uncomfortable. My depression and my acceptance of the inevitability that I will one day die has become the only comfort I have in each waking moment. Very few things continue to bring me joy at all and nothing gives me the same release of dopamine as they once did. I become agitated easily by things that shouldn't get to me. I have panic attacks 4 times a week and at this point they barely even phase me anymore. I have panic attacks in front of people and pass it off like there is nothing wrong. Every time an opportunity arises where I could die, it tempts me. When I stand at the edge of a high place, I'm tempted to jump, to save myself the pain of tomorrow. My intrusive thoughts commonly involve my death or something related to heavy injury. I'm lost without a map. I've convinced myself that the tunnel will forever extend, and i will never find the light at the end of it. Death seems like the only simple escape. The only way to get away from how hard life will inevitably be. Life seems like something that is beyond what I can handle. It seems impossible that I could handle something so complicated. Impossible that i could sufficiently provide for myself in any real capacity with any real standing. I find it difficult to see myself in 5 years because I don't see myself being a breathing human being in 5 years. My mental state is beyond repair, no amount of therapy could fix this. I am frequently told that help is always available, which is why it is so painfully ironic that you get left on hold for 30 minutes when you call 11 13 14. Mental health is so swept under the rug in so many societies, so stigmatised, so ""unrealistic"", that a large majority of people would rather let their feelings compound and burn them from the inside. ",A state of Misery.

To the point where sometimes she’s very distant and other times not. It’s even hard to make plans with her cause she always gets too nervous and has admitted this to me. She had a terrible past with guys which is part of why she is like this. She recognizes that I’m much different based off my actions (not just words) but admits it’s hard to get too close. However when we do hangout it’s amazing, we’ll lay down and hold each other and I can tell she has love for me. She’s just seems to afraid to consistently show that love towards me.

I don't have as many meaningful experiences as other people do, and even though I save a lot.

Like it's a different GP, likely will be referred to a different psychologist, but I just keep thinking the result will be the same. I swear I don't have any real thing in my life to fix to get better, it's just existential dread if that's a thing. 

I took meds in the past, talked to a psych, improved my diet, improved my daily routine, took a holiday, tried new hobbies but the root of my depression is kind of phylosophical on a way. Simply put, the benefits of living just don't outweigh the monotony, stress and effort of surviving; like I have nothing worth living for and nothing to achieve that will make it all good in the end.

2022-11-23 11:38:59,depression,"Hi,

So I’m not expecting to get much out of this but thought it could be a way to vent and share my thoughts rather than just let them brew.

For the last 4/5 years or so I feel like I’ve been in a constant downward spiral , sure I’ve had times where I’ve thought that things were going well or that I was seeing improvements but ultimately it’s just getting worse. It’s getting to the point now where I just don’t know what to do or how the fuck I get out of this trench that I’ve dug myself.

Bit of backstory;

Had a happy upbringing for the most part, enjoyed going to school had many mates I could confide in etc and grew up with my two brothers in an amazing family home.

A few years back my parents divorced which caused the family home to be sold and all of us had to go our separate ways, I think I was 20 or so at the time. I have been working the same job since I was 18 at an insurance company, the pay is fairly average, I don’t hate my job but I do hate myself thinking that I’m going to be stuck in it forever, I can’t for the life of me decide what career path I want to head down and even trying to think of things just stresses me out further. I’ve never had any real savings to fall back on and when I had to go my own way me and my brother rented a small flat in the local town, this was a huge shock for me as I quickly found myself running out of money every month prior to payday. Since I’ve moved out I’ve managed to rack up about £9000 in debt, none of this is due to the actual rent as such, I’ve instead had 3 CCJ’s issued to me due to parking tickets that I didn’t dispute at the time, these have crippled my credit score meaning I can no longer look for anywhere to rent. Due to this I’ve fallen behind severely on bills which I’m also in debt to and have also had to take out multiple payday loans just to pay rent. At this point I’ve pretty much given up on my credit score as it is beyond healing. I will admit that I made some bad decisions such as going on nights out with friends when I couldn’t afford to,  but this distraction was the only thing that actually gave me any joy or happiness. To summarise the total debt is around £9000 or so.

Around a month ago or so my brother moved out the flat to go live with his girlfriend meaning I have been having to front the rent myself since which I just cannot afford to, I’ve got no money and chasers for the bills coming in left right and centre. 

I wouldn’t say that I’m mentally unstable at all, infact I think I’ve managed to maintain a positive outlook for the most part over the last few years thinking that everything will sort itself out and that eventually I’ll be okay, however I now think that that outlook is part of the reason I’m in this mess. However it’s getting too much to handle recently and I just really don’t know what to do. I’ve tried burying my head in the sand and also tried to have a tunnel vision and get out this mess, but both options just lead me back to where I’ve begun.

I met my current girlfriend around 9 months ago and she’s been incredible, she’s helped me so much and I just feel like she deserves someone so much better, For the first time ever I feel depressed as I can’t be the person she deserves. I had to sell my car 6 months ago to pay rent and she has insured me on hers and driven me everywhere. I have told her my issues and she is doing all she can to help but unfortunately she doesn’t earn a huge amount more than me and has student debt to pay off, I don’t want to rely on her anymore than I already am.

I do have hobbies that I enjoy outside of work, one of which being the gym. I was big into bodybuilding and without sounding too arrogant I was very happy with the physique that I acquired. I planned on starting PT’ing and Online coaching but I always talked myself out of it and simply can’t afford to change job due to the immense debt that I’m already in.

I’m still in contact with both my parents and we do get on, however the divorce is still in dispute meaning the money from the house sale is still awaiting settlement meaning neither of my parents can provide any financial aid, it really damages them seeing the position I’m in and not being able to help and I really can’t bear seeing how much it’s affecting them.

I always believed that money can’t buy happiness but I’ve quickly realised that having none and owing thousands can really take away any sort of happiness you have. I can’t remember the last time I actually woke up and was happy.

Sorry if that just seems like a big rant, I really haven’t typed out my story very well and there’s a lot of other things that have happened/played an effect in my current situation. It’s got the point now where even if telling a load of strangers on the web can help then I’m willing to try. Based in UK for anyone wondering.

Thanks &lt;3","In a bad way, any advice appreciated"
2022-11-23 11:33:41,depression,"I always smile
Im always having a great day
Im always good
My smile is deep 
I can make it reach my eyes
I think I add to those around me
Im always willing to listen 
Im always available to lean on
Life is always great and its all oh so good
I tell my daughter my tears are from joy
So much joy 
Im always going places
Always have plans and even if I don't, I'll sing some Karaoke at home
My laugh is infectious and I like to make those around me laugh

But in all honesty, when the vail drops and I expose the truth….

I hate it here, I hate every second, every minute, every hour, every day
I hate the all consuming loneliness that never stops only grows
I hate how even surrounded by people, I feel so damn alone
I hate the end of the night, making the dent in the couch deeper
I hate not allowing myself to enjoy life before becoming a mother, I hate how terrible I feel about those feelings 
I hate how one day I like what I see in the mirror and the next I'm absolutely disgusted
I hate how I project my own insecurities onto others and I never feel satisfied
How at the drop of a hat a switch can flip in me and a voice wispers in my head, enjoy it now
I have so much to give, I know it, but when that darkness consumes me, what a glorious nothingness it will be

I wish I enjoyed doing it all alone as much as I say I do
I wish I believed it when I said how overrated a relationship can be
I wish I believed that this wave ripping through my chest was normal and that happiness needed to be worked at daily 
I wish that when I tell people to not feel sorry for me because I truly am ok with how my life has gone so far, it was true
I wish that my younger years where filled with joy and that when I laughed at the fact that I ate lunch in the bathroom all high-school, the laugh was genuine and not a way to deflect 
I wish my best friend didn't live in another state
I wish the only family I am close to, my cousin, didn't live across the country
I wish that when I told my girl friends, you are absolutely amazing, I believed that about myself too

I don't know if its cowardice but I'll never end it, I know that much 
I'll keep crying at night and waking up early
I'll keep driving 40+ min one way to my daughters school because I want her to have the opportunities I never did
I'll keep going to my job, the one I've been in less than a year but is in my dream field that finally pays me enough to give my daughter everything she deserves
I'll keep crying a bit in the bathroom before heading out with a big smile 
I'll keep coming home and packing my daughters lunch with her before going over her spelling words
I'll keep staying up late at night wondering how did it come to this
I'll keep hoping that maybe tomorrow will hurt a little less

How do y'all keep going when it feels so overwhelming? What do you tell yourself, what do you do, to get out of this funk?",Im hoping tomorrow hurts a little less...
2022-11-23 11:29:38,depression," I try my best to be normal.  I laugh and chat and people generally think I'm okay. 

Deep down I'm hurting all the time. When I'm with my husband, I become flipped inside out. I become instantly wounded no matter what. It's like I am constantly getting my feelings hurt at every little thing. What it feels like is when he comes into the room, my wounds feel over exposed like the scab has been ripped off and it's an open flesh there. Even blowing on it a little hurts a lot.

I get sad a lot. We could be enjoying a nice romantic evening and then suddenly a crash of sadness will overcome me and ruin everything. He gets annoyed. I get more sad.  Everything I do feels like I'm doing something wrong or saying something wrong and I just want to be single again.  I just want to  learn to love myself in a quiet, controlled environment even though I know that's not a good idea. I don't need isolation. I need support and companionship.

I too don't want to be crying all the time, or be sad all the time. It's hard to be productive and the lack of being a functional adult makes me embarrassed and ashamed. I do the bare minimum so that I don't shamed. I try to clean here and there, and maintain good hygiene. But it's like. Even though I do the bare minimum, when someone advises that I do a little more like throw the trash out earlier so I don't rush on garbage day, I feel like that's a deep personal attack. I just want to scream ""I AM TRYING MY FUCKING BEST. OK. YES. I KNOW I HAVE IT GOOD AND PEOPLE HAVE MORE ON THEIR PLATES BUT ARE STILL DOING FINE BUT I'M NOT. I'M NOT OK. BUT AT LEAST I'M STILL TRYING.""

This is usually what happens. I told myself I was finally going to cut my nails.....3 weeks ago, I have not cut them. I told myself I was going to shower....3 days ago, It has almost been a week since I last showered, I have just gotten good at hiding it...for the first week and a half. But what I would say is my biggest problem, is that I don't feel any emotions at all. I had a math test last week worth 12% of my final mark. In the last 10 minutes, I still did not even finish half of the questions (slow math guy) but I also knew I messed up the questions I already answered because I never practiced anything we learned at all. I would just scribble some bs down for when my teacher would check homework, and she would buy it because she told me she trusts me. Anyways, with the last 10 minutes of the test, I had no stress at all. My best friend was so stressed right beside me, and a girl started crying because she did not have enough time, and I just did not care at all. This is usually what happens on my tests. Even on exams. I feel no stress about anything. I am not happy or fulfilled with anything either. I am averaging high 90s in computer science and hate myself for not getting 100%. I am never fulfilled. But also, I am not sad about anything. Big news does not shock me. If something sad happens I just have an ""eh"" mentality. Not that I don't care, but It just does not affect me in any way. The last time I felt happy was when someone called me ""A Useful Short King"" no idea what short king stands for, but I felt superior in the moment because I was being useful and guiding someone. The time is 2:13 am here (my mom would kill me if she found me online right now ). I will most likely wake up at around 8:05...20 minutes before my bus reaches our stop. I will most likely run out of the house with nothing but a shirt in winter weather, carrying everything including my breakfast, and organizing myself on the bus knowing I have not done any homework or assignments... and not feeling guilty.

And while this was happening I started experiencing emotional numbness. No matter how much emotion or whatever emotion I'm feeling I can't show it. My friends all said I've changed ever since the start of this and now they're all super distant from me. I don't know if I did something to hurt them but they all just say I'm weird now and don't want me around. I haven't had a good cry in around 5 years. I don't mean a few tears here and there because that does happen sometimes, I mean full on sobbing, letting out pent up emotions. Winter is now here, that has made it all way worse. How my schedule works I don't see the sun other than on weekends. I feel like I'm going to snap but at the same time I'm worried I'll hurt somebody and lose even more people I love. I feel like another factor at this numbness may be being raised as a man. I don't know what it's like for women but being raised a man has had the thought beat into me that I had to be tough, never show emotion and always deal with everything myself.  If I didn't I was considered weird and weak. I also realized my future is nothing but shit. Seeing the way the world is I know no matter what I do the world will end up shitty and half destroyed. I want to be able to express my emotions again. I want to get rid of this numbness that's doing nothing but building up negative emotions inside. I don't want people hurt, the only thing that really keeps me happy is the thought that I can make others happy. But sometimes I want to be happy.  Another thing I tend to do if somebody is mad at me or I'm mad at them my first thought is what would they do if I killed myself. I know it's horrible but I can't help it. I've thought of suicide before but the thing that always pushes away that feeling is the thought of the people that would be sad if I was gone. I hope someone here might be able to help with my problem. If you can't there's no worries, we all have our struggles and please worry about yours before worrying about mine.

2022-11-22 14:27:58,depression,"I (20f) have an issue with self harming and I don't know what to do about it. I feel so abnormal.

I have depression and anxiety and I take antidepressants for it that I've been on for about a year. 

My dad and his entire side of him family has severe anxiety, depression, and narcissistic/personality disorders. My mom has depression.

I'm engaged and have been with my fiance for five years. 

I used to cut or scratch myself on my thighs right before I started my medication. I would do this during depressive episodes that would mostly be triggered after fights with my fiance or times where I didn't feel seen or heard by him.

I had my worst episode a couple months into medication. Me and my fiancé got in a really bad fight and he threatened to break up with me. I felt overwhelmed and so angry that I just threw something off the kitchen table, was sobbing and yelling, and then started to bang my head against the floor. I didn't think about it I just starting doing it. No injury came from it but I just banged my head so hard on the wood flooring, like I was self destructing or punishing myself. I just felt blinding rage at the situation and at myself for being this way.

After this i upped my antidepressant dosage.

No self harm occurred until really recently. Me and my fiancé had another argument and with my anxiety, I started to just scratch at my forearm. I did that so hard in the same spot for so long that it was left bleeding and then scarred up. In this same episode I started banging my head against the car door and repeating that I wanted to die.

I don't want to die but in these moments my feelings are so intense that I feel that way. I'm not really ever depressed to the point I can't get out of bed and do things, I just feel this way when something happens that I feel so helpless and overwhelmed by.

Generally speaking, I get really easily angered and irritated and often blow up at my fiance. 

My fiance and I are now taking a break because my mental health has become too much for him to handle. 

I'm trying to understand these things I do and I need to be better. I'm going to see about changing my meds and try therapy soon. But I feel so confused by myself. What could this be? I've thought I have autism for a while just haven't gotten diagnosed for it (I read that these behaviors occur in autistic people but that could be completely wrong). 

Does anybody struggle with the same things? Why do I bang my head and scratch at my skin until it bleeds? I want to be better for my fiancé because he doesn't deserve to be treated this way. I love him.  

I want to be better but I feel really alone. I know I'm a good person and I'm not trying to manipulate or hurt my fiancé. I always feel so embarrassed and bad after an episode. But I just can't handle big emotions. Someone explain this to me.",self harm is confusing and I need help

It's all-consuming- every little task feels like a herculean feat. I'm also burning out at work which makes me mad because I started only January this year and it's a job I chose and liked but now every little task seems impossible. I often find myself just looking at my phone after my part is done in meetings and just have lost all interest in doing meaningful work beyond the bare minimum expected from me. It's hard to even ping someone. It's impossible to get started on the big tasks. I try to break it into small parts but mostly I just end up pushing every thing till the deadline and getting it done. But that isn't very sustainable in the long term. I just feel so incapable and detached from everything. Normal life isn't too hot right now either. I hardly go out, hardly do anything but sit at my desk or on my bed everyday. I know I should move about, go out, take a walk at least, but I can't. I'm so tired. I'm so done. I went to a therapist last week but it wasn't helpful. Now I can't find the courage to try it again. They were one of the most positively reviewed psychologists near my area. I am not suicidal, but I have suicidal thoughts all the time.i dont know where they come from. Sometimes I think maybe not now, but how can I live 30 more years like this? I can't imagine suffering through this for so many years. I'm really thinking about medication- the psychologist I went to said she wouldn't recommend it- it takes a long while to get off them etc. plus my mom also takes them and yeah, now she can't get off. She says she feels bad if she even misses a dose. I don't know, it's so much work. So many things. I can't handle them. But final conclusion, medication: thoughts?

Still, the last couple of years a lot of things happened in my life and my depression got more severe each day. The last month I was getting better, healthier, my mood was improving and I was having more energy. 

Still, yesterday I saw my ex for the first time since we broke up one and a half years ago. We had a very deep, long relationship full with love, respect and happiness, but we weren't moving through the same life path so the best option was for us to split up. The breakup was nice and healthy. 

When he texted me saying we should meet for him to give me my stuff back, I thought we were going to speak about anything, catch up, have a deep conversation, anything. But he just stayed for three minutes, didn't say anything meaningful and left. And as soon as he left I just felt this horrible and painful void I can't stop feeling. I just wanna cry, and cry, and cry. I feel like he was just fine and not interested in me at all anymore, neither as friends, or as a person who was important in his life for years.

And yes all the dreams came crashing down, I had to change plans..promises were broken. I feel so stupid, I should have guarded my heart. I should have realized that things were too good to be true. I did really miss the boat on love. I am 32 and got nothing to show for in life.

It is funny because one friend already said a long time ago that I am not meant to find love and whenever I will it will be an illusion. I got so mad at that point that I stopped talking to her.

I was doing so good when I started my lease back in the spring and didn't need it. Why do I need it to relax and just  chill 

Like why do I keep circling back to the head of my problems and understanding them to the point of making me miserable but then I do nothing to change and fix it 

Why do I keep running this cycle of despair and regret and utter self loathing, coupled with the embarrassment of accentuating these feelings 

How do I get through this season when it feels like they just keep getting worse and worse? I can't spend 6mo of every year a Mr. Hyde",yikes on bikes I need to photosynthesis

2022-11-22 12:40:22,depression,"I constantly think about suicide. I sit in my room and watch TV holding my glock 30 or 1911 pressed to my temple. A bottle of Jameson and a miller light to chase it. I just lay there like this. I dont know what holds me back honestly. I'm not sure if it's cowardness ( I know suicide is the cowards way out but fuck you, you can still feel like a coward for wanting to die and not following through) or if it's because I still have hope for a better future. I've recently aware become of my codependency. I always feel like this when someone leaves me. Whenever I find someone I think is going to be the one it distracts me from these feelings. As soon as they leave its a tsunami of suicidal thoughts. I believe this comes from childhood trauma. The funny thing is I can't remember a memory before maybe 13 years old. Also a sign of trauma.... I knew this particular situation wasn't going to work out. I'm 24 and recently was in a ""relationship"" if you could call it that with a 33 year old woman with a baby dad and a kid who has a new summer fling every year from what i heard from my closest friends who are married, Mike and Angelina both close to ther 40s (Weird friendship I know, but they are my closest friends). They recently had their 16 year old kid pass away, so I can never bring my problems up to them. That isn't fair for them. But back to the story, I knew it wouldn't work out from the start from what I was told. Of course my dumbass  didn't listen. So that isn't a thing anymore after 6 months. She's just fine I'm in fucking shambles (lol). But anyways, there's alittle backstory to my most recent set off. I don't know how find happiness independently.

2022-11-22 11:26:53,depression,"Lookingfor advice.

Before the Covid lock downs I started having suicidal thoughts at work. It got so bad that I couldn't go into work without feeling like i was going to physically cry for 8 hours. I went to HR about it and ended up with a major depression diagnosis. Since I couldn't see a way to return to work during the pandemic while working through therapy I quit my job and filed for short term disability. 

The thing is that this has been building up for years. Jumping around jobs and feeling like total crap my whole life. Recently I got diagnosed with ADHD, anxiety, and persistent depressive disorder from an actual 4 hour psych test. Which explains a lot. Although, it's difficult for me to put everything on those things alone. 

I have a bunch of defaulted debt, I have no job and haven't worked for almost 3 years now, I live with my mother, I turn 30 next month, I constantly feel worthless, I gained a bunch of weight from stress &amp; pills from doctors, and I have no motivation. 

I went to tech school but somehow ended up graduated with a CAD certificate that's worthless. I tried working for an architect and construction company and was fired from both. &gt; 9 months at each and I can't say I got much experience. Yes I have the technical training for for the software but i don't have the education of an architect or engineer to be able to use the software. 

Which is why I've been trying to get treatment for my ADHD then work from there. Almost 3 years of therapy and I can hardly see an end or solution to anything. There's no decent job I can handle and if there is I'm so depressed and adhd that I can't hold down a job long enough to make it actually benefit me. I'd really like to have some independence. 

When I think about setting a goal like independence it makes me sad because I don't think I can achieve it. It's easier to forgot my goal and I often do, intentionally or not.",My life is ruined and going nowhere

I’ve just never felt like anything I do is good enough or deserved. Anything good that happens, I spend more time waiting for the other foot to drop than truly enjoying the good thing. Any achievement that I have is just others not recognizing what a fraud I am. 

So far, the thing that people are most “proud” of me for is overcoming a substance abuse issue, but even that feels backhanded. Like congrats, you’re less of a piece of shit than you used to be.

Even the good things that do happen in my life go to shit. I got married 3 months ago after 4 years with my now wife. All that time she never threatened to leave, but now she’s already threatened divorce three times. Part of me questions whether she is really in love with me or just with what I can give her. All she’s ever wanted was a child, and that’s what many of our fights center around. My psych meds have destroyed my sex drive, and while she was mildly annoyed with it while we were dating, it’s now a huge issue because it inhibits our chances of conception. She wants me to go talk to a doctor about switching meds to correct this, but I’m just so afraid that switching or stopping meds will lead to the intrusive thoughts winning, and then I’ve left an expectant mother to raise a child alone.

2022-11-21 15:34:37,depression,"I am still a bit confused so I’m sorry if this post seems a bit all over the place, but I need your advice.
My girlfriend and I have been in a relationship for almost two years and are living together. My GF sometimes has trouble with feeling down, she says it happens randomly for no particular reason, and this feeling usually goes away in a few days. I’m not really familiar with this feeling myself, but i try and support her as best as I can and she says it’s helpful to her. 
The last few weeks she seemed down again. It could be because of seasonal changes, or that a few months ago we had a bit of a rough patch, but we’ve talked this through and know what he both can work on. The said that she’s been pondering this a lot, which might be why she started feeling a little blue and now spiraling into something bigger. I was not really worried before, and we can openly talk about everything. However, it’s been a few weeks now and her somberness does not seem to get better. Now she even says she doesn’t enjoy things the same way as she used to, like meeting with friends or going away for a weekend. Her emotions have overall flattened, including the feelings towards me. She’s afraid (and so am I) that this is not going to change. We both hope and think it’s the somberness talking, and that her true feelings are just temporarily buried somewhere. I am very confident in what we have, and we both still very much want to get old together. But I’m having a hard time too. 
I don’t want to loose her and I want to help her become her own, happy and loving self again. However, I’m not sure how to do this.

I don't know where to start, because I've never written a post like this.  I don't know what I'm looking for in writing this.  Maybe someone will be able to resonate with this little post. 

A little history of me, a few years ago I wanted to take my own life, because I wanted to stop suffering; I am medicated for depression, ADHD and anxiety; I have a psy; I'm currently waiting to see a psychiatrist and I'm lucky because I have a very good support system.  However, despite all this, I find it extremely difficult to navigate in my mid-twenties. Currently, I work about 40 hours to meet my basic needs, but I live paychek to paychek and I have a loaded credit card with thousands of dollar on it. I don't practice my ""dream"" profession, because I have no idea what I want to do. I feel like I'm on a artificial respirator and accomplishing nothing. My days consist of sleeping around 15+ hours (when I can) and endlessly scrolling on my cell phone to get away. I feel caught in a cycle, I work; I sleep to escape reality and I pay my bills and debts (which never go down). I know that money is a factor that makes me very anxious, because I'm always afraid of running out of it since at the end of the month, I have practically nothing left. I try to start small projects to stimulate myself, but I always end up giving up because I lose interest or have no energy. Fortunately, I know how much potential I have and that I am a brilliant person.  This is one of the reasons why I feel taken.  I've been caught in this loop for several years and I sincerely want to get out of it, because I don't want to remain in a ""victim mentality"". I know this short post doesn't quite represent the pain I'm going through, but I know that even though I'm in a completely dark, windowless tunnel right now, one day there will be light.

The other sounded like a lot of what I know already. Truth is its a top 10 world University and if I had done my research Id have realized it was in fact about 1 trillion times better.

I went through a period of extreme anxiety, panic and depression and binge drinking before I even knew I got the scholarship and yet still managed to get the scholarship. But given the state I was in I didnt do my research and didnt even apply for the top 10 world program. I was hell bent on not going anyway and then at the end reluctantly caved in to pressure.

Now Im here in another country hating the other program and just looking on the other one with serious deep regrets. I was in quite a state, I had a total mental breakdown but damn...I never expected this.

Is it possible I would have just crashed down anyway given the very high course work there? I mean they probably have 10.ti.es more work than I have here. But it.would have opened incredible doors in terms of consultancies and work. Im so upset and I cannot get over it.

I'm also a ""giFtED"" student, and I currently attend an ivy league institution with a full scholarship.

I think the biggest cause of my depression was the fact that I convinced myself that it was purely cognitive... long story short, I went to 3 different psychologists and they didn't really know what to do with me, so that convinced my sick, egotistical mind that I was too smart and cynical for this world. In my fit of heroic isolation, I refused to tell anyone that I wanted to kill myself everyday for at least 13 months.

I just spent almost exactly one hour browsing this subreddit and found many parallels to what I'm experiencing: I don't have motivation for anything, I lack a passion for anything and I don't entirely have a person to fall back on.

I'm straight out of highschool, having graduated not even half a year ago even though it feels like it has been fucking centuries. I don't see a future for me that I like that's in reach.

I recognise.. I've had depression and all the other mental health problems since year5.. I've never rly been good at school, but seriously haven't recovered since covid. 
I.. still can't revise computer science I am so behind and my scuicidal thoughts make me feel all of this is useless and pointless because I'm gonna be dead next week anyway.. 
That's why I have no motivation for any of this studying and catching up after I've been sick and my very bad computer science teacher doesn't help which makes me realise I need to revise the whole course with no help
It's so hard to study.. I'm so easily distracted, I can't focus, i forget all i study anyway and when I don't get something I get self critical and as I said.. it feels so pointless 

Now that I'm 18 I realise.. I've had a safety net just because I'm a child, and that all I need to do is learn to focus on my studies.. just for two fucking years, then I can get an apprenticeship and fucking be depressed again or focus on another goal.. all I want is straight B's man ;-;

I've.. never told my parents about my problems with depression, anxiety, insomnia, body dysmorphia, gender dysphoria, harming myself and rly strong and real feeling urges to kill myself. I want it to stay like that but anyone in the uk, now that my 18th birthday has passed a few days ago how do I get diagnosed and helped without anything being known by my parents?

I really do love her and want her to know she is way more than she puts herself as, but it just hurts to see her get into awful relationships over and over again. I understand consent is mutual and want her to understand that I want her to be comfortable with things and let me know what she wants, and what are her needs. I understand I can't force her to see how much she means to others but It breaks my heart to see her like this and to put so many hints and relieve hints from her that she loves me to reject it.

Not by crying, or screaming in my car to get the negative energy out.  All I know is that I have been looking at this screen for a while now and keep on adding, deleting, and or rewriting sentences over and over again.

Starting with, who am I? I don't really know that one myself.  I'm in my late 30's, introverted, male, and I live in Florida.  I consider myself an Independent Progressive, and Gay / slightly bi0sexual.   Tho, I'm closeted to my family as they are way too conservative... but well they probably know but don't bring it up.

I'm alone/single and unsure of what to do in life. My brain always thinking of how terrible, and worthless I am and society not helping.  Be it the news media, politicians, and other right-wing extremists' opinions on the LGBTQ+ community.

Is this my life? 

All I do is eat, sleep, work, take my medication, and repeat.  Add in listening to music, youtube, porn, etc. I don't feel like I have any meaning.  I'm probably overmedicated on Bupropion, Duloxetine where I have ups and downs, and lately, I have just been in the dumps.

Anyway, something that’s helped me manage this a little bit was telling myself this is just a symptom of a disease. It’s a real disease and I tell myself, it will pass, I’m okay right now, it’s going to be fine. The way I kinda allow myself to do this is by focusing really hard on on the things that make excited still. This little bit of empowerment is just enough for me to cheer up a little bit. And it’s as simple stuff as like petting my dog, my family, mg youth, and always knowing, no matter where you are who you are, you can really shake things up and go on an adventure. Like literally, you could have the crappiest job and as long as you’re not in severe debt you could take a little time off and just go to a place you’ve never been to. You’ll see things you haven’t before, meet opportunities and friends you never would’ve. All you need is like a 100 bucks and a day off.",I think I might’ve found a good depression coping mechanism.

2022-11-21 11:06:23,depression," 

Hey everyone,

I want to start by saying I’m safe and will remain that way. I’m 29 years old and have struggled with depression for quite some time. How long is tough to tell. I’ve alway felt low, but a part of me believes it started disingenuously. Kids wrap themselves in found identities — the clown, the athlete, the poet, indifferent, cynical — and those identities tend to blanket their insecurities. I think I wrapped myself in depression because, growing up in the Tumblr age, it made me feel interesting or intelligent or desirable. I tried it on, and somewhere along the way it became my skin, I suppose.

(Sorry if this gets long. And sorry how many times I use the word “I.” I try not to make myself the subject in conversations. People appreciate it.) 

With that role of course comes suicide ideation. But over the last few months, maybe years, I’ve been struck with these intense waves of genuine consideration. And I’ve watched the reasons to live lose their form; like watching a picture sink into the ocean from the shore. Features dissipate. A nose, the silhouette, then the picture’s gone. I still have a few reasons keeping me around, but I worry sometimes.

What confuses me is the lack of theater. I’m not struck with a fit of despair. It’s not particularly sad at all. Not particularly dramatic. Nothing special. It’s like dried gum on concrete. It just is. Caked in. Again, I’m safe and wouldn’t act on it. I have a wonderful partner, but I don’t want to burden them. Their world is happy and the idea of it being anything else makes me sick. I also couldn’t do it to my dog.

I’m a relatively independent person and don’t like talking about this to loved ones. So I don’t know. I just thought maybe I’d put this out in the world and see what happens. Change of habit. I’m fine. I’m not writing this from the edge. My apartment is lit. Dinner is in the oven. It was a fine day. But outside my window, there’s a little clump of grass climbing through the concrete. Right next to the dried gum.",Having a Bit of Trouble

2022-11-21 10:59:03,depression,"Opioid pain killers they don’t make the pain disappear, they just make the pain not hurt; like it’s still there but it’s tolerable. That’s been my experience with antidepressants. A few years ago I accidentally went on a bit of a depressive tangent while seeing my doc. She recommended therapy but at the time I made too much for free therapy and not enough to afford regular therapy so she prescribed me sertraline (Zoloft), 25mg a day. 

It’s helped, I no longer want to jump out in front of a truck but I also don’t fear death, like for work I’ve stood less then a foot away from a truck zipping by at 60+ mph (97+ kph) and just not cared. I still don’t have the drive to do anything and my hygiene is still shit but I also don’t want to end it either. I’ve gone from constantly feeling sad to feeling nothing. There have been a couple times where my doc fucked up or I was too busy to refill my meds and I went a week or two without them. After years of feeling nothing I found I kinda liked feeling sad again. There’s a line in the song Pain by Three Day’s Grace that I find pretty relatable, “I’d rather feel pain then nothing at all”. Sometimes I also do numb and dangerous shit without realizing or caring, there’s this spot I like to go camping near the edge of a cliff. Whenever I need to pee I just walk up to the edge and piss off the 50 foot drop. Last summer I took a friend there and they started freaking out when I went within 20 feet of the edge, they basically had a heart attack when I stood on the very edge. 

Now, years after starting these meds I finally make enough to afford proper treatment, my doc has referred me to a psychologist for ADHD and depression and all I gotta do is get off my depressed ass and fill out the paperwork. 

Anyways, I’m sorry for the long rant/ramble, my question is this, are antidepressants supposed to fix depression or just make you numb to it?","Antidepressants, are they supposed to be a fix or just mask the issue?"

for the past few weeks, i’ve been talking to my school guidance counselor about my mental health issues, but even with that i feel like i have to hold back a lot of information, since certain information has to be shared with my parents, if i bring it up (ex: suicidal ideation). and even thought she does try her best and i appreciate her for that, being a therapist isn’t necessarily her profession and i feel like i could be better helped if i were to see an actual therapist.

2022-11-21 10:35:46,depression,"Today, I went back home for Thanksgiving break and I realized there is no reason I want to live. However, too many people count on me for their own issues or to keep the family together. 

This past year has had a tole on my family, much like other families rn. Of course COVID and politics has driven a wedge between a lot of my family members and I seem to be the only one to help find middle ground between everyone. Anyone else that could help has refused or distanced themselves from the family so I'm stuck being the mediator. Part of me wishes that I had done the same, but deep down it would break my heart to see my family tear itself apart. Additionally, I have never had a good relationship with my father. He was never an active part of my life and I instead learned things from my grandfather, uncle, or older cousin about male topics. 

Today I aired my frustration of other family members with my parents after getting home, and my father called them sheep which really bothered me because 1. I am very protective of my family and 2. I do not consider him family. Also, calling people names has never helped any problem. It's reductive and not constructive. So I left the house to go into the woods. I have never felt so at peace. I quickly realized that nothing would make me happier than dieing alone in the middle of nowhere. There is nothing I want to live for. I have experienced all I have wanted to and have achieved all of my goals I had for myself. If it wasn't for my family, I totally would.

2022-11-20 16:24:25,depression," I'm a senior year student who was supposed to be graduated last year. Throughout my study abroad, I had a depression. I only have thesis left to do, and it's been one of my major reasons of depression. I'm literally scared of it and anything reminded me of it would send me spiraled. Last year, I told my professor I had depression after months dodging and making excuses for my terrible thesis performance. I told them I would work on my thesis from my home country because I needed my family support.

But I couldn't make it. My last contact with my professor was on February this year, on a presentation event to report thesis progress. I barely able to attend after series of panic attack. After that day, my situation got worsened. I attempted to end my existence and when I was saved I just dropped my thesis altogether. I had thought of dropping out without telling anyone. But I realize not having a degree will screw me in the future, and it's one way to build my life again.

So I enrolled again this academic year, but I have decided to drop my thesis project and start another one. The problem is, I don't know how to communicate it. I have been gone for so long, and I don't know how to explain my absence to anyone from my uni. I don't know who to talk first and what to say. I've been dragging this for weeks, and I know I'm getting desperate and crazy with the passing time.

Could anyone please help me? I'm scared of opening my email, but I have managed to do it little by little. I'm blank about what to say.

TL;DR - I don't know how to communicate my comeback to my professor after a year absence due to mental health issue. What should I say in my email in an appropriate way?",I don't know how tell my professor about my comeback to school after a year of absence

2022-11-20 15:46:07,depression,"I have spent the last few hours just reading and reading about other people’s experiences of dysthimia. Trying to see if I can relate and if my symptoms are valid or I am not an imposteur for feeling like this. 

The things is, I have been struggling with feelings of sadness, emptiness and loneliness ever since I was little, so it feels really weird to think how it might be a mental illness. I am 22 and even though I study psychology and I know a lot about depression, to me it always felt like this is for other people, not for me. I have always been functional, a gifted child, over achiever, externally doing alright and functioning. I got so used to my feelings of persistent emptiness that I thought this is my personality. When a good friend of mine went through a huge depressive episode this year and had to medicate, a part of me felt jealous and that was when I realized something is weird. I was jealous that she asked and received help. Her pain was visible because she isolated and stopped functioning for weeks, but I have always held it so tightly together for others that no one knows how much pain i feel. 

Lately I’ve been feeling so hopeless thinking i am stuck in this body, with this brain, for the rest of my life. I’ve been contemplating suicide a lot. Passively. But it has never been so consistent before. I also have a sort of premenstrual dysphoric disorder because i feel really depressed and get really intense suicidal ideation before my period sometimes.  But this time my period has passed and the ideation is still there. I feel lonely and don’t really know how it can get better since this is all I really know. I feel stuck and unlovable. I get so stuck in my experiences of being rejected romantically and it hurts so much to think about them. I feel like there is something wrong me with me a lot of the time, like I’m really wired differently and hard to find someone to connect with romantically. I know it’s my low self esteem speaking but i can’t make my brain shut up. I feel so sensitive and most people can’t get how much it hurts to live with my brain. I cry randomly. Some days are better than others and I had moments when I felt happy with life, but sometimes i feel like my default state cannot be content and I am doomed to live like this. The worst things is when good things are happening to me and it’s hard for me to acces the feeling of being purely happy or joyful. It doesn’t last long and then i blame myself for it.

My beacon of hope is the fact that i am in the process of changing my therapist, the one I’ve been seeing for aprox 2 years. Even though we talked about my pessimistic and low mood states, she never suggested on diagnosing. Now i reached a point where i feel stuck and even though i know what experienced from my childhood might make me feel like this, i feel like knowing these things doesn’t enable me to change anything about myself, it just makes me feel more stuck.

Thank you if you had the patience to read. I think i needed to vent. It’s like i’m waiting for someone to validate my feelings, I think I just want to be seen and believed. It’s probably the first time I look at myself and also admit all of these to myself as well. but i’m still super scared that nothing is gonna change for me and that dysthimia is a curse and a life-long struggle that is never gonna end.",dysthimia
2022-11-20 15:37:28,depression,"I feel so alone and like such a burden right now. I just found out my family pet just died today. He actually passed yesterday, but I’m having no contact with a family member so I just found out through others today. I miss him so much, he was the best dog ever. He got me through so many bad moments of my childhood growing up and we always had such a special connection. I didn’t get to say goodbye to him, and it’s breaking my heart.

2022-11-20 15:34:48,depression,"Hi! 
I've been depressed from as long as I can remember although I think it really started around the time of puberty. Before that I was rather cheerful but prone to angry behaviors. I definitely absorbed a lot of this from home and it kept increasing. 

My post puberty years+right after, especially my early 20s were perhaps the most intense. It was when I exhibited what was clearly bipolar behavior and it was also when my behavior was least controlled (common). 

Late twenties and early thirties were largely a calming down eventually getting to a point of heightened self awareness and the ability to recognize onsets of different emotions and triggers.

The question is, right now, it's easy for me to both identity my moods, prevent it from negatively affecting others and also recognize both causes and triggers. However, I simply cannot seem to fundamentally change the natural patterns of this. Is there any evidence based method that don't simply provide a short/medium term fix and actually change things more fundamentally?

I'm constantly exhausted having to deal with myself, especially during the lows. The highs are definitely better suited since it's a tad easier to come down then go up and I love the manic energy since I can do something productive. 

Tldr, I'm unable to find purpose or meaning at any time but the lows constantly had be planning my death at some point in the future. I'm not suicidal but I feel like at some point, I wouldn't have enough time to redeem myself and will forever remain a failure. 
(The feeling of being a failure is the core cause and I doubt any amount of doing anything will ever make that go away)",Will it ever get better or is the brain physiology too rigid for sustained change.

I eventually got my duck, and she was beautiful I spent all my free time with her, we’d go on walks to the lake and she’d swim in the pond, she cuddled me whilst we watched tv and I had her bed right beside mine when we went to sleep. 

I’ve never felt quite a bond as I did with her, I loved her so much, then after three years of bliss I came come from school ran upstairs to her pen and excitedly went to see her. My mum stopped me in my tracks and told me that she had passed during the day and they had already buried her in the garden. 

I froze, I had never felt such soul crushing heartbreak, I went out to her cage and just sat their crying for a few hours. A few days passed but I couldn’t stop crying.

My mum bought me a new duckling hoping to cheer me up, and although I tried to love my new duck it just wasn’t the same. 

Eventually time passed and it’s been about 3 years since her passing, and just today I burst out crying thinking back to my first duck.

2022-11-20 13:45:25,depression,"Feel I should mention I've dealt with anxiety&amp;depression for as long as I can remember. Pretty much, About 10yrs ago I began filming at some local public events (just from the crowd) that my Dad and I would go to (a quite niche thing) just because I thought it was really cool and wanted to share it with friends/ strangers online. I would edit together some videos for YT and people were watching and enjoying them and encouraging me to post more so I did. This was sort of an outlet/hobby for me as well.

I never really talked about/ shared it with people I know other than closest friends &amp; family. I enjoyed the anonymity of YT &amp; I never wanted to be known as the person behind the channel. I wanted it to just be it's own thing that people could enjoy and I didn't want any connection to it.

The channel grew and I became super conflicted because I knew there was a lot more I could do with the channel if I chose to but I didn't know if I wanted to take it to that level which would include the channel becoming fully part of my life. Participants in the events would start commenting on the videos and I did participate myself in one of the events with intentions of meeting some of the people but everything moved so quickly that it didn't really work out. I became depressed about the whole thing but just continued doing what I had been doing mainly because of the encouraging comments.

I kept looking for other paths in life to take to get me away from the channel but could never really figure it out and kept finding myself at the next event, filming again. It became a habit, I didn't even know if I enjoyed it or not anymore but I just kept doing it. Meanwhile the channel continues growing. The more the channel grows the more conflicted I feel because on one hand I know there's great opportunity if I want to basically become a public figure in the community but on the other hand I don't know if I want all the attention or if I want to stop the channel altogether.

I found myself feeling relieved when events were cancelled and just feeling super depressed about the whole thing. I feel like the channel is holding me back in everything else in my life because it is all I think about, yet I'm holding back from going all out with it so I've been in some kind of weird limbo mode. Doing basically the bare minimum with the channel yet always thinking about it.

At the end of last season, one of the two venues that I've been filming at shut down. Most of my content came from this venue and this was a perfect excuse for me to stop the channel which my viewers and everyone would've understood. But I chose to do one more season, with just the one venue and therefore much less content. After that, I would at least take a hiatus, try to focus on some other career, and see how I felt. Now, some other person started doing what I'm doing (with the channel) except they have decided to go all out (I knew it would happen eventually) and basically become that public figure which I've been avoiding. But now I worry that if I stop, people will think I'm quitting specifically because of this other person coming in. The timing is just so bad and I just feel terrible.

I really don't know what to do and it's been honestly consuming me, I feel I can't continue on with the channel at this point but I'm also scared to stop because of what the community will say/think of me and I know this other person will be very successful because I know the possibilities and I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to let it go. Like it would haunt me.

I know this whole scenario sounds ridiculous but I really don't know what to do and feel extremely alone/helpless/depressed which honestly scares me because it's not really that serious of a problem to have. I can't believe what an odd scenario I've got myself into and I know it's probably impossible for anyone else to understand and I'm in this on my own &amp; I really don't know what to do.","This sounds ridiculous, but it's really been killing me"

This left me feeling as if I couldn't trust my own blood rightfully so but its translated to relationships in general family ,friends ,loves etc. Growing up after that really wasn't that bad I had a loving home support from all sides of my social dynamic but it never made me feel better being honest with how I felt about what happend or being honest with myself about who I let myself become because of that, let me summarize as best as a I can.
8-14bullying , first loves , bad grades ,a few friends still had interests hobbies pursing social relationships 
14 got a prescription for adderall for adhd and it made me feel too good was taking 120mg xr with a 5 hour energy on top got too wired used weed to level me out then I decided I didn't like being wired.
15-17 started taking hard drugs mainly opiates heroin codeine hydrocodone morphine you get the point, Stole money from family destroyed all my relationships. (except for family I've mended that) robbed peopled scammed people lied to get what I wanted who I wanted and was smart about it until the drugs and what was happening in my life came to a boiling point.

18th birthday ran out of drugs short story later got baker acted and for the first time in a long time felt bad about who I was becoming what I had been doing, seeing my mom cry as they took me away sparked somthing in me to at least try to be better. Detoxed in there got out.

19-21 was lost for awhile friend got me into trading threw me some money bones my way was a asshole still he picked up on it left me to myself rightfully so discovered I didn't really know what I was doing buckled down worked 16 hour days some weeks to get to a point where I could at least examine a individual company and make sense of it did put the system to work on paper for a half a year works. Put real money on the line bitch out because I lack conviction when it's real self doubt mainly then it played out could have made life changing money and it fucking DRAGS I mean come on you got 500$ and could be at 10k on the week if you just stuck to your initial plan, its not always like that had a half a year with real money making averaged 2k a month but just gambled and smoked bought clothes just in my room going stir crazy. And I'm just in this cycle over and over again and I don't know what to change first because it's so much to change I still use weed to cope I just smoke and listen to music for hours and just can't get a grip on even why I'm doing any of it , it's mainly for family but it's not enough for myself to want to continue I just want to give up 
Feel like I've hurt too many people 
Feels like even when I try to adopt that new habit mindset and stick with it for MONTHS one moment of not and im right back to where I was initially and maintaining myself to do the things I need to for myself is so stressful even though it's not much I just crumble trying to keep it together 
I haven't felt happy in years and when I did it was because of people I shared those memories with and being vulnerable enough to even start a real relationship of any kind is like pulling teeth my face tenses up I just want to get out of the situation .and at the end of it idek yk fuck it

2022-11-20 13:06:40,depression,"Was just depressed last year. I almost ended it. Now I experience anxiety on top of this. I’m failing school. Cant even make myself do simple tasks. My family won’t understand. My stepdad will hate me, my mom will be disappointed. My grandparents will be disappointed. My friends will be disappointed. I will officially have no one that sees me in a positive light. 

No matter how good I did in high school, now that I’ve failed, I’m a disappointment. All my parents ever said to me was “you don’t want to end up in a community college or working fast food do you?” 

I’d rather die than have to be financially supported by people who don’t even have the mental capacity to attempt to understand my situation. They don’t know what it’s like to suffer 24/7 and want to die every waking hour of the day.

2022-11-20 13:01:56,depression,"I’m 30. My life is going nowhere. I don’t have a single long-term goal. I will never have my own house/apartment due to the prices. I don’t want to have kids. I can’t gather the energy to date. Got out of a relationship in March due to my own decision as my mental health has been slowly declining. Been in therapy for a year, this week I told my therapist that nothing has any meaning in my life. She instantly asked me to find a psychiatrist who can give me meds.


I love my friends. They are very caring but I always tell them everything is fine. They have no clue I’m losing my mind. I live all alone, while they are all planning kids/marriage/moving in with their SO, planning on buying a house//car/apartment and I have nothing. I can barely leave my home due to the extreme anxiety I have in crowds. My spending habits have put me in a corner, because I spend all my money each month just to get a dopamine hit and some serotonin. Plus because as I’ve said I don’t have any long term goals. If I had some money put aside I could just take a few months off from work and maybe travel or just go on a complete digital and soul detoxication.


I’ve always been the “clown” of our group. I’ve always tried to cheer them up or make them laugh, because I love seeing them happy and cheerful. I usually come off as a carefree guy and probably this is why they have no clue about my issues. I can barely get work done on weekdays and on weekends sometimes I sleep 18-24 hours just so I have to be awake for less of the day.


I’ve fucked my sleep pattern, I’ve fucked my apartment because I didn’t clean it a single time for 3 months now, I’ve fucked my finances by overspending. I’ve fucked my body because I gained so much weight in a year. My hair and beard is a fucking mess, I haven’t been to the barber for 6 months now. I rarely take a shower (as I work from home) maybe twice a week or something.


I used to care a lot about hygiene. I used to shower 1-2 times a day, use face lotions, took care of my beard and hair with conditioning lotions, I used to be on a slightly strict diet to keep my weight in line.


I’m not considering self harm or anything, it’s just that I’ve become numb to everything. Recently a game I really really love has released and I couldn’t even get hyped for that one. My friends are barely available for a game or two as they are living an actual adult life… I just feel alone. But at the same time I want to do my own thing without other people.

2022-11-20 12:41:14,depression,"As said in the title, I've suffered from periodic depression for &gt;10 years. I never got a proper diagnosis. But I just had a big one today, so now I'm seriously considering doing something about it. Before this ""big one"", I already felt low and mildly depressed for 2 \~ 3 weeks, but I could still function. Last night I was happy and was discussing travel plans with my friend. And then I watched a very sad movie and received two bad news in the same time (stupid reason, right?). Then I kind of broke down and felt suicidal. I couldn't fall asleep till 7:30am, I slept horribly, and throughout the day I have a bad appetite and no energy to do anything. Now I've calmed down a lot but still feeling a little suicidal. I feel like this is the most severe depression I've had in years. I thought I've had everything under control; now I doubt myself.

I don't know if it really counts as clinical depression or any kind of illness. Basically I have periods of depression every once in a while; they usually last for days or weeks and then they go away. When I'm not in those periods, I feel like my life is great, nothing's going wrong, and I have a great future. Years ago, these ""periods"" were very bad; but now, during those periods, I'm just tired and sad, with low energy, but I can still function. I didn't even realize these ""periods"" were called depression until my counselor pointed it out to me. But my counselor couldn't diagnose anything, and frankly, after all these years, I just want to know what the hell is going on with my life. I need a name or title.

Years ago when it was very bad, I went to a psychiatrist once. He said it wasn't clinical depression since I didn't feel depressed all the time. Then I ran away. I don't know if he's unprofessional or anything, but that did put me off seeing psychiatrists anymore. I'm afraid I'll just embarrass myself again?

Another signal that have made me feel I'm a weirdo: when I'm doing something, I just cannot stop myself. Kind of feels like addiction. I think super lot, and if you ask me to stop thinking, I cannot. I feel like my brain is just too active. Also I cannot stop myself when I'm playing video games, or even when I'm working on my project (so actually that's helping me a little bit). I feel emotionally attached to some drinks like coffee and bubble tea. I feel distressed and upset without them and I literally drink one every day. I don't know if this is really a symptom, but I do feel weird about it. People just say I'm focused and stubborn but I always suspect if it's something going wrong with me.",I've been experiencing periodic depression for &gt;10 years. Is this really an illness?

2022-11-20 12:07:20,depression," In order to escape depression, one first have to discover how have fun by oneself and where to look for it. Many people found it hard to find their own fun, therefore it’s very important to develop that quality. It is true that human social interaction is very important, but its too easy to stick to the busy mode and to forget about personal development. You have to enjoy your personal time at least as much as your time with friends. Some people find it difficult to go out alone, for example, people who want to make friends. These people tend to make themselves irrelevant in the eyes of others. Even for such people, making a friend list is important. People who have a lot of social contacts are very often depressed. Some people have trouble starting conversation with others, but that’s alright. You don’t need to make conversation to others in order to feel good. In order to escape depression, you have to find things you can enjoy doing alone and do it. Another important point is to be grateful for everything you have, no matter how small it is. Because if you don’t appreciate what you have you won’t appreciate what you might have in future. If you can develop some skill in a certain field, then you will find new things you can do and improve. So, it’s very important to know yourself and what you like to do. Also, it’s very important to stop thinking negative thoughts and focus on what’s going right. One of the main characteristics of someone who is depressed is that they start to think about the past and the future. They never realize how much they are wasting their life just thinking about the past and the future. If you spend too much time focusing on something that’s already gone or will never come, you will be lost in thought and get no closer to the solution. So, in order to escape depression, you have to be present and realize how infinitely better that iis.",Late night thoughts

2022-11-20 12:05:42,depression,"So me(26f) and my date (23m) met and hooked up 3 times. Things were great and we were texting a lot, until a series of stressful events happen in his life and work. He was keep telling me everything was too stressful for him. While we were having a good time, currently he really don’t have any energy for romantic and sexual stuff. So he wants to back down a bit. I know he had a history of quiet bad depression (not sure if he still has it now, but the last time when I saw him, he doesn’t look well at all). 
Also for context, he is from a more conservative country, while being a liberal. I feel like he may have trouble accepting help from me( offered a few times when he needs it. He always says he was fine and never accept help )

So I totally understand him and giving him time. We did not text for a week. I sent him one message yesterday to ask if he is doing well in one of the issue he was dealing with. He says that issue is fixed now and I am sweet to ask and he really appreciates me checking on him. I just say hope all other things are going well and I am here for him if he needs help. And wish he has a great weekend. He read the message but did not answer back. 

My question is, I feel like I may not have anything else can do except give him time. I never had depression or any other mental health problem so I am sure my method of dealing with problems is different from his. I think the best thing I can do is respect him and give him time. But I also want to keep the relationship going. If there is any good advice on the situation. I would appreciate it :). I want to support him as much as possible and I don't mind give him time at all.

TL;DR: date with depression history are withdrawing from interaction due to stressful events. What should I do to support him while maintaining our relationship?","My date with depression history is withdrawing, what can I do except giving him time?"

2022-11-20 11:25:14,depression,"Oh hey what an original fucking title you stupid bitch (said my mind to myself).

So this is the second post I write here, this is embarassing. My mind is always telling me to shut up and that everything I say is stupid or doesn't make sense.

So I have like, three fucking health conditions currently, four with my depression, no I will not talk about them because it's literally eating me from the inside emotionally. I seem to be getting better in two of those three illnesses but I'm so afraid I'm gonna relapse and never get better (this kind of thinking is not new in me, I'm a hypocondriac).

This is also embarassing to say but I hate my mom (I sound like a 12 year old emo hitting late puberty). Actually, I dislike all my family, and I don't hate my mom, but I despise her. She was controlling and overprotective when I was young, and I know I'm far from fucking perfect but she's just so negative and closed-minded, it's a miracle she once fucked and got pregnant. Her behaviors have definitely shaped the way I am for the worst.

Currently, and lately, I've been relapsing. I usually can keep the monstrosity that is my mind and my bad emotions at bay, but I've been having too many triggers lately and now I'm unstable again. 

All of this has led me to, self-harming... after one year clean (my emo teen self would be proud).

Perhaps only two people will read this and go ""damn this dude lost it"", and they wouldn't be wrong, but I feel like I'm being judged all the time so this is one of the things my mind whispers constantly: ""you're so broken it's laughable"".

2022-11-19 15:42:54,depression,"I don’t know. It felt like my battle with my depression had been going fairly well. I was going outside, keeping healthy habits but now I’m back to square one. Recently, I found out that my cousin (19m) was hitting on one of my friends (15f). He has some immunity disorder and he grew up pretty much isolated. The rest of my family uses that to justify his wrongdoing. My family just infuriates me. It’s the stereotypical Asian family. My career was already predetermined from birth. My father was a software engineer, and my uncle, and my other uncle, and my other uncle. I told them I wanted to be a teacher and now I have my family me. But even if I did decide to be a computer engineer, they’d still find reasons to yell at me. I could do everything and my dad would still be disappointed. I made it to varsity tennis - just like him - and he didn’t say a thing to me. I joined the robotics team they wanted me to join. Not a word. Do this, do that. And I do. Yet I don’t even get a “good job”. I hate my family. I genuinely hate my family. 
Not only this, but my anxiety has been going through the roof recently. My kidney has been having issues recently. Having blood in my urine and pain in my lower back area. My dad insists that it’s just a kidney stone because I “eat too much sodium” and argued because he’s “wiser”. He knows better. He refuses to empathize. He doesn’t listen. And he doesn’t even try to understand.
Sometimes at night, I think of suicide. It’s a vivid topic but it’s a lingering thought in the back of my mind. My life doesn’t have impact. I’m just mediocre. I don’t do anything special. I’m just the side npc you’d see. Life doesn’t feel worth living. I wake up arguing, I go to sleep arguing. I’m stuck in this loop of negativity and hopelessness it just doesn’t feel worth it.

I went further into my shell and fell into a deep dark depression, contemplated suicide multiple times, and didn't leave my dorm room for the last 2 months except for food.

I told a ~kinda~ close co worker that I was on 2 weeks of sick leave for mental health issues when she asked if I wanted to go out for drinks last night.

Sometimes life kicks your ass, I battled forever. But eventually the strongest soldiers fall. It wasn’t no one’s fault. Don’t feel like you could of done more. It’s my fault. That’s just how depression is. sometimes I want people just to ask me how I’m doing but when they do, I push them away. 

Even if  they try to say I was intoxicated I felt this way sober, you know what they say. “Drunk minds speaks sober thoughts.” 

It might sound hypocritical but just be there for someone you think is going through depression. Sometimes actually being there for someone even if they don’t know how to talk about it, just take them out. Because it’s better then being home alone when them thoughts creep in.

If your battling depression, I wish you the best 🖤 I know how hard it is to open up to people when they don’t really care. You start feeling like a burden, and people just talk shit. Then they’ll come to your funeral and say rip I wish you would of talked to me. Lol it’s the same story with this depression shit.

Hits me and gaslights me. Manipulative and do everything except give regards for my well being. I used to do very good at university, I was always on the deans list, got a good job and work hard on projects, get along with people.

After what happened with my husband. It reopens my childhood trauma. With a father that hits me, depressed mom trying to kill herself. I keep thinking oh gosh, theres nothing to look forward to. I’m just going to repeat the unhappiness like my parents. I choose not to have a child because I’m scared they will grow up and be depressed like me.

So, since last year, I notice my productivity has been down. I tried to quit but later I changed my mind as I was soo scared of not having my own money with my unpredictable partner. 

But, since i decided to stay, Im taking alot of leave and MC. My boss kinda hates me for that. Alot of miss task, which my team hates me for. Also, around last year, 2 of my best friends at work quit, so it was just me. I didnt try to make new friends due to my depression and low mood, I just kept to myself because I’m scared of being a burden to anyone with my depression. So alot of eating alone and doing everything alone.

I recently had a company event, during one of the exercises, they want you to write down a name on a piece of paper of someone you trust and someone you can depend on. Rule is, you have to choose and write down like 6-7 names of anyone in the hall (around 40 people in the hall). 

After we write down the names, everyone have to go around the hall and put the name that we write on the person’s table.

I did my part, put my team names, and other people, I did expect not getting one vote, but it’s still an eye opener. I give no value for my company and team. Every single person in that room got at least one vote. I was soo ashamed of myself. It was an eye opener.

This event triggers my depression bad, I tried to commit suicide that night. But I was too scared to die.

2022-11-19 10:50:03,depression,"I’ve fought this for so long. I’ve fought major depression for so long and through so much.

I got sober, went back on medication, left a bad relationship, got a cat, went back to therapy, met an amazing partner, got promoted at work, and I just… crashed.

I dread waking up. I put off getting up as long as I can because it’s physically painful to lift myself out of bed.

I feed the cat, take the meds I’m prescribed, put on whatever pants and sweater are closest, and go to work.

Work is okay. I like my coworkers. The work itself is alright. It’s a distraction. I feel so overwhelmed by exhaustion all throughout the day, to the extent that it becomes difficult to keep my eyes open.

I get home, feed the cat, and go straight to bed. I struggle to even make myself food or shower. I used to dedicate time to preparing myself meals, exercising, even being creative or seeing my friends, but all of that is just more than I can handle now.

I lie here and so desperately want to do more or be more. I wanted to be a musician, I wanted to be creative and put something out into the world that moved people. I can’t even stay motivated enough to sing anymore or practice my instruments, and here I thought I could tour with my band and grow some actual following.

If not that, I just want to know who I am or who I can be. I want to feel like something I do matters. Yet, I’m too tired to do anything. I’m so exhausted all the time. I want to make improvements and try to figure out how to be happy, but I’m so tired. I don’t want to be tired anymore.",27 and exhausted

I can understand why people are afraid of confronting the void of death, but honestly, what it's the worst that can happened? To be conscious in the void? there is not place of any kind of conscious in the void if it's truly what it is supossed to be, complete emptiness. So, what to be afraid of?  

I would have kill myself long ago if it wasn't 'cause i have a family that i don't want to hurt with my actions. But seriously, i have no intention of living whatsoever. It's just a job.

2022-11-19 10:45:40,depression,"I’m in kind of a weird place. I’m not depressed in the sense of “woe if me”, but I’m definitely feeling… not great about things.

Work wise, things suck. I’ve been trying to build my own company, and it sounds like my old employer might try to fuck me over. So I could wind up losing the one client I *just* started making money from. It’s been a rough real financially, so feeling pretty desperate.

But I’ve also kind to kind of an epiphany recently, where I was thinking about what I’m really working towards, what my purpose in life really is. And I came to the conclusion that the answer probably is to start a family.

Which lead me sort of reflecting on some feelings I’ve been carrying for a while, and just having this horrible realization that at 34, I’m very likely never going to have the kind of relationship I want. Most women my age seem to all have kids, and I don’t even know how to get into the dating arena anyways. It feels like this intense competition where you’re either graded on being good-looking, or by being successful, and I’m neither. I feel like I’ve tried just “focusing on myself” the past few years, but it really hasn’t helped. At the end of the day, I think we all need a “mate”, and I’m sick of trying to pretend “nah man, it’s all good, being single is great”. Yeah there are TIMES I like being alone and having some space, but I want someone I can really *be with*. Having stupid little jokes, picking on each other playfully, even the occasional fight.

Instead, I genuinely, truly feel like the only option before me is to make enough money, I can just pay someone for their time. I don’t know what is wrong with me. Nobody cares about me, and it sucks. I hate feeling this way. I hate feeling like I’m just some throwaway background character in everyone else’s lives. I’m sick of *feeling* like a hopeless romantic, but not having someone to love. And I know this all sounds like some neckbeard, lose shit, but I really just wish I had a woman I could treat the way I think women *should* be treated; someone to care for, to take care of when she’s sick, to get pumped up when she wants to do something. Someone to drag me to see movies I don’t have any interest in seeing, to help decorate the house for holidays or seasons, to go do “couples’ dates” with.

I feel like my life is just so hollow and meaningless. I’m trying to get involved with hobbies (though everything I’ve been doing is *exclusively* dudes), I’ve started dieting again, but it just feels like a dead-end. I’m not meeting new people, I don’t really have any friends, online dating is so depressing I’ve had to complete stop logging onto any sites because I never get any replies. Any chance at a real, romantic relationship feels completely out of my grasp. Almost like I’ve “aged out of” any hope of finding a real love, and that the best I can hope for is a woman who is willing to “settle” for me. “Life” itself just feels super boring, like nobody even *does* anything anymore. I miss being a kid, when I had friends or could meet people online just to have a “gaming weekend” with, staying up all night joking around, eating an ungodly amount of pizza and snacks, just *having fun*. Anymore, it’s like pulling teeth just to *see* someone, and god forbid you want to have dinner, or watch a movie, or play a board game.

I dunno. I guess I’m just venting now. I just… I hate what “life” is now. I hate being alone. I hate being an introvert, and even when I do force myself to go out where people even *exist*, nobody wants to interact. I hate not having my own place, and that I probably never will. I hate feeling like I’ve become this jaded old man, that’s just a bit too old to hang out at places where college kids hang. I hate having friends who won’t even carve out time for a match or Call of Duty once a month just to hang out, because of kids or their wives having an issue with it. And I hate feeling like I’ve “missed out” on my chance to find someone I can really connect with.","I’m just not having a good time, bro."
2022-11-19 10:44:53,depression,"I don’t even know why I’m writing this. It’s not like anyone will read it. I’m a nobody with a pointless view. Just your average everyday Jane or Joe. Just another living being breathing air and taking up space. Just another person feeling sorry for themselves.

I try so hard to find a purpose (MY purpose) in life. I just feel like it’s to be a subservient doormat to others. I did, at some point find pleasure and happiness seeing my good deeds make others happy, but only for it to end up at my expense. Even the career I chose where I thought I would be making a difference by helping others I end up being treated with such disdain sometimes I really wonder why I even make an effort.

This past year has been a hard one, but from what I hear “it’s been a hard year for everyone.” I should just be grateful, right? I should just be happy I’m in a better position than most people, right? I have a good job with great benefits and work at a prestigious institution. I’m in good health, I can take care of myself and have a family that supports me. I’m a pretty girl with an energetic personality. So it’s crazy to even think I should even feel this unhappy, right?

I shouldn’t dwell on any of my hardships. I should just keep moving forward. I should just forget and move forward with what’s happened to me in the last year: I should just move forward from losing my grandma and my good friend within a month of each other. I should forget that I couldn’t even give my friend a proper goodbye at their funeral because I had COVID. I should just get over how I was dumped by someone I loved and cared about deeply only to find out weeks after I was pregnant. I shouldn’t feel regret about making the choice of not keeping it even though part of me really wanted to. I shouldn’t feel bad for making not the choice I wanted, but the one that I thought was best.

I should stop feeling sorry for myself. Stop beating myself up and being bitter and angry. I should practice more gratitude, I should be more optimistic, I should be happier. I have every opportunity to get what I want and move forward with my life so I shouldn’t be feeling like this…right?","Just overreacting, don't mind me"

Honestly I just wanted to say that lives can get really bad and while it hurts now for most of you I know you will do great things.
Sadly I don't think I will ever realize my full potential, I used to be a pretty scummy guy when I was younger especially around early highschool.
I did some shit I regret did certain things I shouldn't have done because I was young and stupid.
My life has been filled with hardship I had an abusive stepfather who destroyed men any time he could, telling me a couple times that he would kill me or hurt my father it was just a bad part of my life.
I have never really been all that smart the only reason I even passed high school back in 2020 at 19 was because I managed to get into a different form of learning kinda like a trade school.
In general shit has just gone down hill I found out that I was disabled I suffer from an extreme social disorder along with anxiety and clinical depression also being told that I fall somewhere in the autism spectrum.
Shit has gotten worse not being able to hold a job not having a vehicle, living out in the middle of nowhere because my father who is going to retire couldn't live anywhere else.
The system is broken I can't even file for disability because it takes two years.
Writing this is really just a way for me to vent because I have no future, no job prospects that won't destroy my already weakened body.
My mind has deteriorated to the point where I live out scenarios in my manic delusions talking to people who are not real.
Imagineing myself as some cool anime or media protagonist.
The sad truth though is my time is limited.
I have till April of next year that is when my father retires he won't be able to support me anymore and I lack the resources let alone the will to keep going.
I don't have any friends or family members that really care about me, my own father treats me like trash because I can't work then come home and do everything around the house.
I'm not trying to sound like a whiny bitch but I have difficulty just showering every day and I have to manage all that.
Sorry for the rant I just wanted to get this out there I'm preaching to myself.
I know many of you have suffered worse gone through more pain than me but I was told a saying: ""worrying about being compared to the guy who lost a leg won't help the fact that you were bitten by a deadly snake"".

From grades, to schools, to jobs, to girls, even killing myself I got rejected not once but twice. Even with a 6 pack and the best shape of my life I was never considered a ""Hot One"" that people would consider a candidate as a person's boyfriend. My first girlfriend rejected me harshly before reconsidering and then dumping me a year later over text message. Once I got dumped all the friends surrounding us disappeared. No one wanted to be around me anymore and all I could blame was myself. I am the piece of crap, I am not hot enough, I am such an ugly blob, and why am I even alive to fuck other peoples lives up.

2022-11-18 12:15:17,depression,"I have noticed my brother (13) might be going through a depressive episode. He has been spending all his time on the computer, only coming out to get food which he eats in his room, too. I haven't heard him talk to his friends while playing video games (they usually get very excited and scream-laugh)

My family and I have noticed that despite the heat, he won't take off his jumper or wear shorts. We had to insist him, concerned he might get a heat stroke, he wasn't happy at all.

I'm aware he's always been self conscious about how skinny he is (he is currently 49kg / 108lbs and 167cm / 5'6"") but up until last summer he didn't mind wearing shorts or t-shirts.

Yesterday he told our mom he hated his ""dark circles"" and that ""he got expression lines around his mouth"". Mom laughed it off and told him it was natural, but again, he wasn't happy about it.

He has talked about wanting to go to the gym and my parents took him to the doctor to see what exercises he recommended, and the doctor suggested swimming was best for now. My brother was upset as he wanted to do lifting. He took two swimming lessons before he broke his wrist playing football (currently with a cast until next month).

Today I saw pictures from Christmas last year and I noticed how much he has changed from that little boy look to more of a young teen, and I've been wondering if it's these changes that got him upset, or something else I haven't noticed yet.

He gets lots of compliments from girls everywhere, this week he even got hit on by two girls outside school while we were waiting for the bus (one gave him her Instagram @ written down on a piece of paper which he simply shoved down his pocket and forgot about, poor girl!). I'm not sure he realises they like him or what, but he gets a embarrassed when I try to bring these topics up so I leave him alone because I know what it's like when you are a teen.

I have been through severe depression during my teen years, so I'm worried he's not talking about how he truly feels.

Tldr: I worked 10 years for a career goal through a lot of hardships and just feel that my decade of effort has ended because of one exam.

Hi everyone,

Throwaway account as some of my friends and family follow my actual one.

Since I was a child, I always looked up towards space and the stars as a symbol of hope in a turbulent childhood where I was bullied and once sexually abused by a couple of my older peers when I was about 9 years old. As such, I spent my life since then trying to work towards going into the space industry.

In high school, I entered my high school's rocket and drone teams and I won a competition in those teams. I graduated in the top 8% of Australian high school graduates in 2017, motivated by my desire to reach space. In addition to my academic achievements, I also had a large number of friends and a girlfriend that cared about me. I got accepted to an electrical engineering degree as a result of my efforts.

In first year university in 2018, I had a falling out with my friends and my partner (which was my fault) and as such I lost sight of my dream for space. For that year, I dabbled in far right politics before I left due to my self disgust. I also almost got kicked out because of poor academic performance in the following year.

Late 2019, I rediscovered my passion for space after meeting a former astronaut who gave me some words of encouragement. I turned my grades around and made some new friends through my university’s rocketry and astronomy clubs. During the pandemic, I made a startup idea which I sold to a large energy utility for cash, mentoring, and a paid internship.

Middle of this year, I was offered a role developing space systems for the Australian government. I was ecstatic, seeing that all my efforts were starting to generate results. However, as it happened I am pretty much on the edge of losing this offer because of failing the exam to one of my courses which turned out to be harder than I expected from the coursework and mid-semester tests (the offer requires all courses to be passed before I can start and Australian universities have exam hurdles where exams need to be passed for the overall course to be passed). To make matters worse, my GPA will be too low to apply for alternative roles.

I feel that everything I have done has been in vain and that suicide is the answer. I worked 10 years through significant hardships and I have nothing to show for it. I am just simply a massive waste of oxygen. This isn't the way I wanted my story to end but I guess this is it, I can't see any way forward.","Should I kill myself, I have worked 10 years towards a goal and this week it all fell apart"

2022-11-18 11:03:26,depression,"Gotta start this by calling out the obvious lack of comments on a lot of the posts in this subreddit. It’s like we’re all screaming into an empty void with very few people who actually give a damn to comment. Hell, I doubt I’ll get any response or this post will get removed or something because why would I ever have something go my way?

Anyways…

I’m pretty much on the verge of ending it all. I’m just so sick of this life. Just started working at a retail job a couple of weeks ago and I’m already wanting to just up and quit. The workload is just way too much for me, they have me doing the job of 2-3 people, I have an absolute shit schedule, and I’m just so overwhelmed. Thing is, I have little work experience as it is, 20M, so getting hired anywhere else, especially in this screwed up job market, is a total shot in the dark. But if I try to think about applying elsewhere, then I risk losing this job and end up without anything. That runs the risk of disappointing my entire family because they want to see me doing something regardless of if it’s hurting me mentally and physically. There’s a couple people who are extremely lazy in my family so I feel like I’m being forced to ruin my mental state to prevent my parents from looking down on me and comparing me with the lazy ones.

I don’t know what I want to do in life. It seems like every damn thing I want to do gets completely shot down for one reason or another. Musician? No real money in it. Graphic designer or photographer? Too competitive of a market. YouTuber? Unrealistic. Professional race car driver? Again, unrealistic plus it’s a dying sport. Literally anything I come up with is either unrealistic, has no real financial gain, the market is too competitive, or just doesn’t excite me weeks after I first think about it. Plus, I’m told that most of what I want to do “oh it’s just a hobby, it’s not a real career.” But as a 20, almost 21 year old man, I see all of these people in my generation making absolute bank doing damn near nothing either because they were born into wealth, are attractive therefore willing to be spotted by all of these agencies, or they just get lucky. It’s absolutely demoralizing and depressing. Why can’t I have that? Why can’t I live in peace and luxury like these people? Why am I being forced to put all of my energy and time into shitty jobs that don’t do anything useful for me? I NEVER asked to be here, so why am I forced to prove myself in such a fucked up and broken society?

And no matter how nice I try to be or make others feel better, I have never been given anything in return. I put everything into helping people out and I gain nothing from it. So why does it feel like I’m being punished for trying to do good? Is this really our world? Do good things, but get no reward. Do bad things/nothing, be given everything on a silver platter.

I’m just sick of this all. I feel like I’m worthless. I have pretty much no useful skills to provide anywhere, everything I seem to do, I screw it all up, all of my dreams keep getting smashed every single day, and here I am screaming into an endless void of nothingness, wanting to end it all. Oh, but I can’t bring myself to do even that. I’m too afraid of what’s after. Does this make me a wuss? Or am I strong for not taking myself out?

I feel like I’m about to just say screw it and end it. I can’t keep fighting, it’s so hard. I just… I just want it to be over so I can rest.

What am I supposed to do?",I feel like I’m about to explode… I can’t take this anymore

2022-11-18 10:40:08,depression,"[Long vent and wrote it in hurry, apologies for any errors]


I don't know how to even articulate my situation anymore. My parents are messed up, my father is incompetent narcissist, neurotic person , and very unpleasant to live with. Mother is emotional, unpractical fool. They have always fought all their lives, he is emotional abusive, this has caused breakdown for mother multiple times. Only because of Indian arranged marriage system they were able to get married, in any other sane society such people would be left alone. I tried to handle situation as per my capability only for mother, because has no one else and she didn't care to be financially independent. This is India so they don't divorce. I never had comfortable, peaceful, cheerful home ambience. I have lived thru depression throughout. I had bumpy start in youth, couldn't settle down fast enough. Still somehow survived and now at least earning good enough.

Meanwhile my father purchased apartment and put loan (mortgage) on me, not that I was enthusiastic, he made down payment n all initially. We put up with it, hoping may be situation will mellow down with passing years. Though it had its own problems, and its a long story. But fast forward few years now, and no situation only got worse, I am in debt because of this loan. My father and mother are at worse, but he doesn't leave us , because then who will make him food and tidy house! I am in my 30s now,  they are nearing 70, they have lived their life, but I guess mental illness, and years  behavioral mold can't be changed. 

Now I don't want to live at all here. Somehow miraculously I found some girl who is willing to live with me, I had given up on idea of romance and wanted to live single before I met her. But now I know that I can't live married life under same roof as my father. And my mother also don't want to live with him, but he is not leaving her now. No one interferes anymore, and everyone is tired of their shit. I can't keep my mother somewhere else like old age home, I don't have money now. Hoping I would have new start, I took one apartment in different part of city with intention that me and my gf would get married and live there. This has caused heavy burden on my pocket. And yet I haven't moved there yet. Everything feels like bleak now. My gf wants to get married as soon as possible. I wanna sell my current apartment with loan, father to go his own apartment in home town, and leave me alone, but since mother is with me he is not leaving. No buyer is finalizing to buy my current apartment. I feel so trapped now. I don't have anywhere else to go. Whats the point of this life! Why do I have to put up with this.

My sister has published several books, my brother is trying to build a railgun with his friends. I spend everyday sitting in my room doing nothing, not even feeling happy to play games or anything.

I can’t even talk to people, I try so hard to bring myself to but I’m just to shy. I feel like everyone’s judging me, even when I know their not. Or maybe I’m just constantly judging myself for never being good enough.

I’m making this sloppily put together post now because of the paragraph above-I can’t talk to anyone about thing serious. Ive built my relationships in a way where we just only talk laughingly with each other (an action I greatly regret) so now I feel like I’d be hypocritical if I were to ask for anything.

I guess my main problem right now is that I feel like I have nothing in life. As I said before, I have no talents or viable skills, the only thing I’d consider myself slightly okay at is video games, which I know is pointless and it only hurts me more to know I wasted so much time on them throughout my childhood. I have no interesting quality’s, I’m not strong or handsome, in fact if anything I’m weak and ugly. So much so that I feel like I’ve been learning come to terms with the fact that I may be forever alone. I can’t even make commitments to try and do or learn something new, I always end up just fearing that commitment or just forgetting it entirely. 

I’m terrible with doing things with other people, as I’ve mentioned before, but it just make me feel so alone and lost.

I can’t artistically express myself, which is partly what led to this long rant of a post, as I can’t draw or write for shit, so I can’t get out any of my feelings in a way that feels nature, leaving my brain to resort to writing this.

All this stuff together, makes me just want to be done with life. I used to convince myself that wanting to die and wanted to kill myself was two different things, but slowly those thoughts are merging to one and I have no one to tell.

I guess this whole post is just a poorly written, grammatical mess of a rant, I just wanted to get stuff out there, wherever that may be.

Hi, I’m only 20 but I feel so lost and depressed with life- most days I don’t even want to be alive. I’m diagnosed with depression and anxiety; with past therapists wanting to add on BPD. 

I swear the only reason I’m still here is because of my dogs, but lately I haven’t even had the motivation to play with them or be around them. I lack motivation with everything and constantly feel like a lazy piece of sh*t. It’s exhausting and I feel like no one even likes me, or the relationships I form are superficial and not genuine. 

I have my job and I’m attending classes, but I’ve been getting worse grades and I’m only just going to get my associates after 4 years. I feel miserable and I have no idea what I want to do with my life. I no longer have any passions or love for anything and I feel like a complete burden. 

At the end of the day, I feel selfish for feeling like this and making those around me suffer through it. I know I’m unbearable, but I don’t know how to stop it. I’m just having a difficult time and wanted to ask for advice from others going through life.

(please read it to the very end,seriously)
 
To anyone who is depressed,feeling sad,heard broken etc…please just give it a try and sorry If Im not such a great writer,and I am a muslim,just saying.

Anyway
The story starts like this : Since day 1,I had everything I wanted,I lived and still live with 1.6k a month on a country where 250 is minimal wage so basically 1.6k is more than enough.I wasnt a brat though who just spends their family money and whatever,I was kindhearted and still am.I thanked allah for my blessing.You might be thinking,how is that hard?
Let me explain.I had a loving family,loving friends,money,good enough at school and all of Allah blessings.
The only “virus” in all of this was me,I thought so.I didnt have anything going for me,I was young I was stupid etc,13-ish years old,kinda justified maybe.
But at 17,I had changed but past failured,embarrassments because I was the shy type and I was also bullied in school,not to an extreme level but enough to hate my classmates,most of them.I cried of happiness the moment i got separated from them,anyway.
At 17,I was cursing myself,I wanted to suicide,I hated myself depressed,I only played games,ate,slept whatever,I didnt contribute anything.I told no one,only god knew,I never cried infrot of anyone,but I did cry quite a lot when alone.I hated myself in the mirror,I was a broke guy with no future ahead who ate shitty food and with no routine whatsoever,slept ate repeat.I did pray tho,but not 5x times a day,but I tried atleast once a day AND A MUST ALWAYS BEFORE SLEEPING.Just a self-made rule.Anyway

That lasted for about a year or so,It got sooooo bad,but after a year it calmed down a little,I DECIDED TO CHANGE MY LIFE,I did tell about it after a year to my best friend,who was understanding and pushed me to become better and forget about past failures,now im 19,I had a job so i have some money and now im just going to college and trying to be a programmer.
I have improved my : food,I eat atleast 2 good things a day,I have improved my Shyness to a great level,I am more honest,open minded,more hardworking and more talkative,just a better version.I sleep most days 8 hours.
I go to gym atleast x3 up to x6 times a week.
I try to atleast study 10 hours a week or so,and Im starting to really understand what im studying,it isnt just some bullshit.
So :
Healthy food?✅
Confidence?✅
Work ethic?✅
Goals?✅
Trust in myself?✅
More happy?✅

Nothing I do matters and nothing I do is ever going to help me get closer to what I really want.. which I don’t even know what I actually want. I’m just about to give up once and for all.

2022-11-17 16:34:40,depression,"So I'm a pw/BPD. It's caused me a lot of issues in the past and recently my whole personality shifted to be stand offish and unsociable because I can't go through the pain of being abandoned again.

Same with work. I got fired so much that I don't really get invested in work anymore because it's only a matter of time before I need to go somewhere else.

I'm trying to find what I want to do with my life but having an unstable self concept makes this really difficult. Around 8 times now I've packed up and changed my whole life to something I thought would make me happy only to be just as if not more miserable when it didn't work. 

Im a big trier of new things but none of them connect with me. I'm currently looking for classes in my area to try something new and meet new people because I don't want to be that way anymore. But sadly meet up, Eventbrite, Facebook events, all paint the same picture of there being nothing available in my area. 

I stopped casual drinking so bars are out. And it's really dawning on me that I spend 90% of my life looking at one screen or another.

I just don't know what to do.

2022-11-17 16:19:35,depression,"For the past three years my life feels so empty and without any reason to keep on going.
I (m19) suffer from severe depression, sleep deprivation and Asperger autism. I really struggle to concentrate at work and I’m failing all my classes. Idk man I feel so burned out from all the learning I have to do. My boss doesn’t seem to care that much about my mental health, even when I speak about it on a personal level. He always talks to the employees of my age, while he never wants to talk to me due to my failing grades. I already realised that he gives a fuck about me and I hope he burns in hell for that.

I just wanna lay in bed and never wake up. I’m already on sick leave for four weeks due to my depression and nobody at work cares about the fact, that im “gone“. Every day I consume a cocktail of meds to help me in all of this shit and I hope that one day, I just overdose and fucking fall over.

My friends don’t know of my depression and I’m not really a fan on telling them, knowing exactly that they don’t understand. My dad and my stepmom are the only ones I have any real contact with. My stepmom doesn’t get what’s wrong with me. She just always tells me i should just “get over it and go to work”. She is really scared that I lose my job and that I have to start all over again. My father is much better in this, struggling with some mental health problems himself. But he seems too scared to really talk with me, which is understandable I guess.

I visit the doctor every week for a month now. I’m happy to talk to her, because she seems to understand my situation and my feelings better than anyone else. I already called a few therapist in my region, but all of them are booked for the next few months.

I don’t really care anymore. All I got left is my girlfriend. We don’t see each other anymore, due to her working in another City. I’m just so empty and I feel like a lifeless shell.

They include touching corners of walls when I pass by them, and doing stuff multiple times, mostly having to do stuff an even number of times. Typing with my left hand, and I’m right handed. Taking more steps with my left foot than my right. Literally no matter what I’m doing. I have certain words that I prevent myself from saying and if I say it I repeat again in my head as so to undo it. All of these must be done or I cannot experience being myself. At the beginning when i started doing it more frequently I was more lenient on myself and I would go weeks feeling great and feeling like myself all the time, but then as I started going weeks on and weeks off of feeling like myself. When I’m feeling like myself I am very social and want to speak to everyone I see, joking around, making sense, and feel more motivated to go do the stuff I like to do. When I get in stretches where I don’t feel like myself, I feel like everything I’m saying is meaningless, and I’m constantly thinking about how I’m down and I’m not nearly as creative, I certainly become more verbally mean to my roommates. I really liked both of them but now I couldn’t really care less about hanging out with either of them, although I do for hours every day. I am relatively healthy and play basketball 3 times a week. But for probably the last month there has only been a span of maybe a week and a couple of day where I have been happy. One coming from visiting my cousin.

Like it would take a very special unicorn to accept my height. The only way I wouldn't feel like a charity case is if I were capable of attracting multiple people, but it's not like I had the height for that.

It's either be a charity case and lose my self respect, or keep my self respect, avoid dating for the rest of my life, live a life of denying my biological needs.

These are my two options. Do I want to suffer with my self respect or do I want to suffer due to my lack of self respect?

Not to mention I also don't have the emotional stability do ever think about dating. Just a girl online commenting about how she doesn't like short guys is crippling to me. There is no way I could actually handle being rejected in person.

Going back to age 9 I grew up watching my mother drink her life away. I’ve watched her black out and throw things, yell, scream, throw up, go to the hospital because she’s had too much to drink. She has these episodes where she’ll drink way too much and black out and abuse my father. She’s thrown things at him, punched him, etc. My dad is fully aware of her problems and has noticed it first hand. She has literally destroyed furniture, broken phones, etc. 

My mom has even accused me of abusing her while she’s in these episodes because sometimes I take her phone away so she won’t call 911 ( something she has done multiple times) She’ll wake up the morning and act like it never happened, and act like she never did any of those things. For fuck sake she literally puked her in her own bed and 40 mins later she acted like it wasn’t her. She tried blaming me? There was a time where We literally had to drag her inside the house because she ran out and passed out on the side walk at 1am 

I’m 18 now and this is a monthly occurrence. However no one seems to talk about it, They kind of ignore the situation. My dad is fully aware that she only acts like this when she is drunk and continues to buy her alcohol. He also is an alcoholic but never violent.

Yet at 18, when I told my family my cousin sexually abused me when I was 3-4, you'd think I simply announced it was raining or something. It just wasn't a big deal. And to this day, some of my family members still have a relationship with him.

Then, about five years ago, my cousin's husband sent me numerous dick pics. When I told my family, nobody believed me. And I'm not a liar or anything - never have been. Multiple members of my family went to my *ex-husband* to find out if what I was saying was true. He confirmed that yes, I received numerous dick pics from my cousin's husband. Yet my family still sees and talks to him. 

Both of these situations have bothered me for years. I've cried. I've felt ignored. I couldn't understand why my family would continue talking to these perverts.

I want to have a social life and be able to take better care of myself but the awful pressure or sinking feeling prevents me from dropping or going to any lower class. My grades are already slipping even though this is the hardest I have ever worked academically in my life. I study for hours and hours and hours only to get around 75’s on my math exams. I have tried multiple tutors and nothing helps.

I want to get better grades, but I hit a mental wall and feel empty. Past trauma resurfaces. It makes me hate myself. So around I go. 

I want to have more friends, but when I reach out nobody responds anymore. So I start to give up. So around I go. 

I don’t want to be broke anymore, but I don’t have a degree, so all the available jobs are physically demanding. So I get burnt out after 3-6 months. So I get fired or quit. So around I go. 

I want someone to love me, but my mental health makes me not worthy to be in a relationship. It’s been 5 years alone. It makes me feel unloveable. So around I go. 

I fall off the wheel! I want to kill myself. I just want to be hugged and told that I’m good enough. I just want to not have to worry about my next paycheck, to have someone who wants me.

2022-11-17 13:46:12,depression,"I'm current a high school senior and I feel absolutely exhausted. If I'm not constantly doing something, I feel like I am wasting my time and I'm always anxious about SOMETHING even if I don't know what that something is.

I am a very ""people pleaser"" type of person, so I get really anxious whenever I get the remote feeling that someone is disappointed or thinks badly of me (and this feeling is constant). I feel like everyone in my life finds me annoying, especially with the adult figures in my life, and I can't stop overthinking. Genuinely, I don't know how to overcome this feeling and if I have any motivation to continue if its going to be like this for the rest of my life. 

I also met my boyfriend at an extracurricular I work at fairly often (2-3 times a week), and we have been dating for 4 months. I am planning on breaking up with him because I cannot keep up a relationship right now, and I feel like we never even connected as a romantic couple—it just feels like we're friends. There are also a couple other reasons but I am really stressed about how and when to break up with him, especially since everyone at my extracurricular knows about our relationship and I go there so often.

The only control I felt I had in my life was with my eating and restricting how I eat. Now, I can't seem to restrict anything; I feel disgusting all the time because I'm constantly binging on fast/processed foods when I used to be fine not eating for the entire day, and the processed foods make me feel sluggish and disgusting. My eating habits result in a lot of mood swings, which makes me do things I do not mean to other people sometimes and I feel even worse and even more like everyones annoyed by me.

I can't control anything in my life and nothing I do makes these feelings go away. No matter how much I work, I still feel like I'm not doing enough. No matter what I do I feel like people will always hate me. I don't know how to deal with my own relationship. If I eat too much food I feel terrible, if I eat too little I feel terrible.",I have no control over my life
2022-11-17 13:43:59,depression,"My own family can't stand to be around me. I'm so depressed that all I can do is fake it during the day and cry at night. My wife is my world and she never touches me of her own accord anymore. Her love is conditional. If I stopped providing or taking care of her she'd step out in a second, I'm 1000% convinced of it. She's already proven it once. My older kids are old enough to get by without me and my younger kids are too young to remember me.

I have a place and a method picked out- helium asphyxiation, in my car, at the place where we went on our first date. I have my life insurance stacked up so they'll be taken care of and they'll have  enough to pay off the house and all of our debts. They'll be far happier when I'm gone.

Knowing that I'm not alone in feeling this way changes nothing. 

No counselor or medication makes it better 

I think it's time for me to finally let go of any hope of getting better. 41 years of fighting this endless battle against my own brain chemicals is enough. Every waking moment is torture and every night is nightmares, when I can sleep. I'm exhausted and I have nothing left in my spirit. My will to live is completely broken.

I just have to have the balls to do it. I'm scared but I'm scared of going on more than I'm scared of ending it. 

It will happen soon. One night when I can get drunk enough to stop being a pussy about it. One more fight. Just a little push.

Living back in my home town feels wrong. I live with my dad as of rn bc I can’t afford to move out on my own yet and he’s just controlling.

I finally got back into contact with my ex that I had lost a kid with. 
It seemed to be going very well and even better than before. She’s currently on deployment and it had been getting to her to the point where communication had just crumbled. After about a month of it I decided to give her space and I feel as if it was the wrong decision bc I haven’t heard from her since. I can’t seem to be able to move on from her. Even after we hadn’t talked in over 2-3 years. And now every time I get a chance to be with someone new I end up ghosting the new connection bc I’m honestly terrified of attachment to new people. With this I have gone back into a deep depression again. I don’t want to be depressed like this again bc I ended up going to rehab due to excessive drinking.

2022-11-17 12:52:27,depression,"I am currently 30 years old and Female. 

I was first diagnosed with anxiety in the first grade. I had stopped eating. They said it was “separation anxiety” being away from my family while at school and extreme perfectionism. 

In the 7th grade I was really struggling in math. My teacher suggested ADD. I got tested and the results came back that I was “severely depressed”. 

Been dealing with this for 23 years now. Have been in and out of counseling for 23 years. Could write a book on therapy. Tried every medication they’ve thrown at me…SSRI, SNRI, a typical antidepressants…you name it. 

The thing I don’t understand is I came from a very pleasant up bringing. My parents were both teachers. Middle class…no financial struggles. We sat down and ate dinner together every night. My parents were attentive, involved, and loving. They got along with each other. My sister and I always got along exceptionally well. Did sports and activities…took family vacations every summer…It was a childhood that most people dream about. I was always well liked by peers, others constantly tell me I’m “pretty”…I was on the honor roll and homecoming queen. So why was I plagued with this debilitating sadness/lack of desire for anything?!?

I feel like I always quit counseling because I have nothing to “talk” to them about…there’s no past trauma, nothing “wrong”…I’m just overwhelmed by depression for no reason. Depression so severe it’s caused suicidal ideation. 

I guess I want to know if anyone else has experienced severe and treatment resistant depression without a known cause? I feel like my brain is just defective…it isn’t wired like everyone else’s. Or there’s some deep rooted trauma that’s so bad I don’t even remember it?? If that’s even possible. 

My parents were pretty strict and I’m an extreme perfectionist. Anxiety and depression do run on my moms side of the family. But I don’t know anyone as privileged and as depressed as I am? I know it caused my parents a lot of heart ache because they tried to give me the best life they could but yet I was still miserable constantly. If there was a “problem” it could be fixed. But how do you fix it if there isn’t a root cause?

I realized is because their friends don’t like me and see me as uncool. I remember when this happened I didn’t care a lot about because in my head I thought how I at least still have a friend from elementary/middle school but the next time I saw her, she didn’t even perceive me at all and I felt like crying.

That is why when this girl I had in my 1st period in 12th grade being all nice to me and inviting me to clubs she’s in etc, I didn’t really react so much because I know if I gave in one day she’s going to change on me and I just don’t want to get my feelings hurt again.

2022-11-17 12:40:59,depression,"Growing up my mother was always present in my life - but she was never emotionally available to me. I never understood why my mom never gave me hugs, never gave me kisses, never let me embrace her. When I was young, or in critical developing ages as a child, it would be times when I wanted a hug from her or I just wanted my mom to embrace me and I would be outright rejected - my heart would be shattered. I always knew my mom was ""sick"" but my mom and grandma never told me what mental illness was until I learned about it in school. I never even knew what mental illnesses she had until her junior year of high school. 

My mother has multiple mental illnesses that she has been dealing with ever since I was born. My mother genetically inherited some of her mental illnesses from her grandmother - who also had a variety of debilitating mental illnesses. We thought that I had been lucky enough and would not suffer from anything - until junior year when I had a mental break. Thus, I inherited my depression, which I believe is bipolar disorder, from my mother (she also has bipolar disorder).

I've always been sad. Like, for most of my life I spent it hating myself, internalizing hurt and rejection, and just being broken. Somehow, knowing that my depression is inherited is a relief and a burden. I am relieved to know that ""there is nothing fundamentally wrong with me"". For example, I see other people being happy and enjoying life - but sometimes I used to feel as if I was incapable of that. I'm not, I just have to learn how to manage it. I'm in college now (the first in my family to go). It's been hard as hell - socially and academically. I have no friends; guys only find me attractive enough to have sex (my face isn't that great but I have a nice body). I'm doing well in my classes but the depression makes it hard...and sometimes I'm just too lazy/tired to do the work. Some days I feel as if I have no passion for any career.

You know, I think I have the will to live - at least for today. I just wanted to encourage other people on this server (I think? I'm new to reddit lol). I just wanted to say I love you.

2022-11-17 12:21:45,depression,"Hey yall. First time poster here. I'm 28M and just feeling overwhelmed. I work full time 40-45hours a week typically,  but can sporadically be 50 hours+ during busier times. I've been trying to also go to school part time.  I'm on my second  accelerated class for the semester. 

I just I'm feeling  more and more kinda numb and overwhelmed with life. There's  money struggles,  work is just kinds frustrating  and tiring and I wanna leave, but can't really  afford the pay cut. School  just feels like it'll never end. I don't even have a major or career path selected because I'm scared to make the wrong choice and nothing sounds engaging  or enjoyable. 

I just feel mentally  drained all the time and kinda checked out. If I do anything  anymore it's because  I'm just use to it or because  I know simply stopping isn't  really an option. Anything  else just feels like an obligation.  I'm in counseling (2.5 years), but I'm starting to think maybe I should ask for anti depressants because my motivation  levels and procrastination  habits are just so detrimental  that I'll wait until  the last possible  option to change something  because it just feels easier to stay put more often then not.

I'm sorry for the post being a jumbled mess I just wanted  to type out some stuff, but didn't really plan it out too well.",I feel like it's just getting harder.
2022-11-17 12:20:30,depression,"I’ve had the same type of depressive, breakdown-like episode at least 3 times in the past couple of months.

I lay in bed for hours, begging myself to go to sleep. My mind reels and it is almost like I am having a conversation with myself, but I can’t get them to stop talking. Thoughts of guilt, shame, worthlessness, anger, sadness. It feels like it is driving my crazy, like I must bang my hands against my head to get it to stop. I just lay here and cry silently next to my spouse. The voices yell at and shame me. “What do I even have to be sad about? I have a great life. I have it all.”

It feels like it is getting so bad. I have no self-esteem any more. I am so tired. I have no friends and my family is estranged. I have no interest in doing the things I once loved. My sleep schedule is fucked- I sleep too much or too little. I think I am developing an ED. I don’t take care of myself very well anymore- couldn’t tell you the last time I showered.

The last time i was genuinely happy was when i was with my (recent) ex. He just left me to find himself again. But he did it out of nowhere, we were doing fine, then one day it was over, he left and i lost my best friend and the only person i ever trusted and loved. I also just started a new job, i have no money, im still living in our apartment, which is hell because i’m surrounded by things that remind me of him. my family lives out of the state and even then i’m not even close with them. I have nothing left in me. Absolutely nothing. Im going numb, I don’t want to be alive anymore. I don’t want to feel this pain anymore. My chest feels like i’m laying on the ground and somebody is putting their full weight, standing on my chest. I can’t stop crying, all day and all night. I can’t eat, I don’t want to eat. I have nothing to live for anymore. My only source of true happiness is gone. I hate myself. I really hate myself. I’ve called a suicide hotline, I want to end it, but i’m scared. Not if dying, but of the pain. I’m selfish that way. 

   I’ve heard it all, “things are rough now but they will get better!” and “youre strong you can get through this!” The real issue is that I’m not strong at all. I try but i’m really not. I feel like a burden to everyone in my life. Im always causing some sort of distress to them. I just don’t want to be alive. I don’t want to burden anyone anymore.

All I've done over the last couple of years is disappoint them, and I hate myself for hurting them so much.

I go out with friends to try and get out and see if that helps but they aren’t even really friends. The only time they wanna hangout is if I’m doing something like going to a party or if I can do something for them and some of them won’t even respond 90% of the time.

There has been some good memories as I’ve pushed myself to make friends but to be honest I feel like I’m slowly breaking down. I had a suicide attempt in April before my high school graduation and I really felt like I grew as a person and took my experiences from that and the mental hospital to heart. However, moving to New York all alone to start college was a good fresh start but my motivation has dropped and I’m finding it harder and harder to keep going. I’ve found friends here and I’ve had some good times but in the moments that I’m by myself and sober I’ve felt as low as I did before my attempt. I’m drinking and smoking way more frequently and I’m struggling in my classes.

Dont know how long i can live like this",I feel like an ousider
2022-11-17 11:30:35,depression,"Sometimes, well now more often than not I think my social anxiety is beginning to cause depression. I've had social anxiety since I was around 10-11 years old. Even before I started to have social anxiety though and didn't care what people thought looking back I never really had any close friends and even though people somewhat liked me I used to be the one who put all the effort into my short-lived forgotten friendships. I find myself still doing that now with the online friendships I have currently. Ever since 5th grade all throughout middle school and high school so far I have not made a single friend despite being in the same school district for 7 years. I'm a sophomore in high school, and while I might been friendly with some people in the past, I've always somehow never really been enough for them no matter how much I tried. Some people would tell me ""It's not that I don't like you, it's just that you don't talk much."" Well then I tried forcing myself to talk more and sometimes l'd repeat myself over twice just to be left ignored or unheard. I would willingly go out of my comfort zone to participate in extracurriculars, ones which I have genuinely enjoyed but even if I took risks to reach out and we talk we never reach past the acquaintance stage and again I end up forgotten. Even if I got to a point where I managed my social anxiety well enough this makes me think that I don't even have the potential to make any close friends in the future because there's always going to be someone out there more interesting to them than I am and l'll never live up to anyone's social standards, let alone my own.

It's funny how I feel like people don't care about me yet I still have this extreme fear that they're judging me. I could've sworn there was a group of girls glaring at me at and whispering about me at some point and taking little steps to be around other people, and make myself feel exposed to others has done nothing but make me feel even smaller in the end. I think my social anxiety has been getting worse rather than better. I spend my lunch breaks doing homework in the library and even there I fear other people might be watching me and judging me for being alone. I recently started new classes with a heavier schedule and I already have several presentations/group assignments to worry about this week. I've signed up for honors classes, not really realizing the amount of collaborative work and presenting I would need to do. And I can never feel comfortable enough to tell my teachers or even my parents about my social anxiety because they would find a way to use it against me. I feel like I'm going to end up miserable for the rest of my life. It's funny because I used to always think of myself as an optimistic person. But now I realize that it doesn't matter how hard I try or what I do to change, social anxiety will not go away will not become more manageable for some people like me. I mean l've read some of posts on this sub and some adults have around 20-30 years old seem to still be stuck with this crippling fear of socialization. It doesn't get better, is what l'm quickly starting to believe each day. My grades are going to take a toll because of my social anxiety. My lack of motivation in creased because of my social anxiety. I feel my entire future just going down the drain and sometimes all I want is for time to stop because everything is moving way too fast for me to be even capable of handling. I have to worry about college soon. The amount of stress school has put on me with extracurriculars, time management, presentations, group work, loneliness. I don't know how much l'm able to carry. I don't even know where to go from here to be honest. I know that it’s only bound to get worse as I get older though.","I feel like it's time for me to accept the fact that it's really over for me and I'm probably just going to end up alone, and socially secluded for the rest of my life."
2022-11-17 11:30:01,depression,i’ve never realized how abusive my family was until i got older.. always screaming when i was younger almost hitting each other i don’t have one relationship to look up to my parents rarely say i love you to each other they don’t even sleep together ..i don’t wanna kill my self but i also don’t wanna keep reliving the same day by myself no one checks up on me my family doesn’t give a shit my moms an alcoholic smokes in the house so i always smell like a cigarette never leaves the house  and my dads always at work every friend i’ve ever had found a “best friend “ and i was just on the side i’m no one’s #1 person no one would even care if i died tonight… maybe for attention. i’ve never heard i’m proud of you or i’m happy for you. i try so hard to do what people expect me to and i’m giving up sometimes i’m happy but it always feels like  this laying down at 9:00 pm on a Saturday every weekend cause no one wants to hang out with me it feels like everyone hates me and i don’t even know who i am i hope this reaches someone that’s in a similar situation that ur not alone cause i sure fucking feel like i’m drowning right now i can’t even cry anymore cause i numb myself with weed and alcohol. i don’t look forward to anything .. everyone’s in college but my parents expect me to pay for it and find a ride since they won’t let me get my license working 8 hours every day and weekend at 18 like a slave  life doesn’t feel worth it to me anymore. i disgrace my parents for having me knowing this would be the outcome. always trauma dumping on me like i’m there therapist dad always telling me he wants to die always saying he’s gonna leave once i’m 18 always saying i’m just gonna come out stronger from the neglect and bad parenting. i feel like a ghost in everyone’s life i just desperately need someone in my life to tell me it’s okay my boyfriend always tells me it’s not the same as a friend or a parent cause it just feels forced. my boyfriend keeps pushing me to be closer to his family but he’s going to college next year and i don’t know how to feel about it considering if i wanna be with him during that time so i just feel like what’s the point. there’s really no point in anything we all die someday and 90% of us don’t even leave a big impact,i wanna disappear(rant)

one ever really liked me so i’d end up alone most of the time, bc i’d avoid my family. i’d also have a shower routine and would eat two meals a day and do my hair everyday so i could try and make my life a little better.

2022-11-17 11:23:51,depression,"I don't know how to start this but here we go. I am a 21 year old hispanic male, mexican to be specific, in College and working. I currently work at Walmart, started about a month ago or so and has been pretty good so far. There's days where I don't know how I feel anymore, not sad or happy, just there. The past year and a half has been rough for me, especially for my family. Come to find out Feb 2021 my dad's infedility and this wrecked the entire family possible. Lost money, failed school including my brother all to ice it with domestic violence. Being the oldest of 3 is hard as I feel the constant pressure to not only do good in school, save, but also set the example to my siblings. Afterall, I am the first in my family to have many ""firsts"". First to graduate high school and the only one to continue onto college, etc. There's days where I feel like shit for how rough it was and how rough it continues playing out and how it all affected my old job and school. It can all be traced to my last relationship, a toxic, energy demanding, money draining shitshow. Where I went above and beyond only to receive very little in return, even though Im not the type to ask for anything in return. If I do something for anyone its bc I really care for you or love you alot. Around the time the relationship was going South, August 2021, I was supposed to graduate with my associates onto a 4 year college. I should've been a Senior by now but here we are Sophomore year at the same school. I did transfer despite not receiving my associates only to fucked in every way possible. By this time my partner began getting distant to being ghosted out of nowhere. I was blocked on every social media platform but like its said, respect the dead. At the moment I thought it was over and tried moving on but given how emotionally weak I am it made go through it. I lasted at the most 3 weeks at the then new transfer school, bombed all my classes, and walked out owing big money, something I paid off already. At this point my parents began suspecting I was no longer in school and lord did this hurt. It didn't hurt bc of what they suspected, but bc I was feeling like I was no longer doing for the only thing they hoped for. it made me think of all the work, sacrifices that went into getting me this far in life. Like I said, the only one to have made it this far. It made me think of our homeland, Mexico, the poor little town ridden of poverty, where wood burning is common, where 5+ kids is the norm. But it mainly made me think of my grandparents, my grandma who was always beaten to shit and bore 10 children, 2 who died. The one lady who  with her possible strenght let go of my mom, but also my other family members in the name of a better life. The day she passed away no one was able to travel for the funeral given the status at the time. If you are curious of the cause of death, a bursted malignant tumor on her shoulder. It's a death I do not wish on anyone. The death of my grandfather, same story, just complications of a stroke. Sometimes I think he died of Sadness, given how I saw him once before his death, the one and only time. I look at my father who vividly remembers arriving to the states January 2000 in the back of a Bronco to a cold ass Chicago winter. My mother, October 1998, a busted left big toe whose remains is a stump of what used to be a nail. It makes me feel like a hypocrite and not being thankful for that and the other countless stories which have made our American dream a possibility. But going back, I dropped out fall 2021 and went balls deep into my feels. By october we had broken up, home was a living hell with the constant arguing, my brother was already failing his classes and ultimately was transferred bc of grades, and I was one broke mf. In an effort to pay my debt, I picked up 2 jobs and a side hussle, but also did it to relieve my mind, keep in mind I was going through it. This did not work at all as I once again tried going back to my old school. my ex decided to come back around the beginning of the semester, being bone crushinly tired, this just made me fall again. My old job, an okay paying job from a previous internship fired me. I was in so much pain that my only refugee was my bed. I slept and slept day in and day out while my parents thought I was in school. I needed to isolate myself from the world. At this point, my GPA was garbage and still is, but working on it as I write this. Bc of how it all played out, a business degree is no longer possible but Pre- Stem seems very likely given my academic performance and past hickups. But even then, i feel hopeless. One of my professors talked me into public health or any sort of health administration given my performance but my interest too. It sucks because the public health is asking for a 2.5 gpa by graduation in May. And the lord knows this is not possible even if I received all A's next semester. Given my financial aid being for business, any extra classes I would have to pay for, money I do not have. I'll leave it at that for now, the story is only 3/4 of the way.

I “got over it” about half a year ago and I don’t know, I wanted to put my thoughts somewhere that wasn’t my journal for once. Life has been… great without depression. I mean there are still many, many things to worry about and honestly I’m not in a good position, kind of sucky actually, but it just doesn’t matter nearly as much now. But it frustrates me so much that because I’ve been depressed, I can still feel it lurking. God, it’s like it still haunts me. every. day. 

I know that it could easily… come back. And it scares me so much. I don’t want to be depressed. No matter how much I can say and truly believe that I absolutely won’t kill myself, that I’ll try so hard to be happy, how can that keep it from coming back? I feel kind of bad about it since there are so many things that are just as bad as being depressed, and that everyone has their own problems, but it feels so unfair that some people don’t have to worry about these kinds of things. They can live the rest of their lives free of that fear. Free from this thing that just follows you wherever you go. I will try though. God I will even if it nearly kills me. I refuse to give in.

My therapist has recommended I start journaling. At first I wasn't interested. But slowly I started one after finding a journal I liked on Amazon (I used to just write in a notebook and that did nothing for me). This one I have been keeping up with every day with tracking my moods, things I've ate, and just my inner thoughts. Looking back at the last 2 weeks entries. I seem to have a pattern going of the same thoughts over and over (no self harm thoughts) coming back in my brain. And these thoughts I forget to mention to my therapist after my session. Does anyone else keep a journal for their depression? And if so do you share your journal with your therapist? I'm wondering if I should either photocopy the pages I've filled out and let her read them on her own time (if she even would. I don't know how that would work) or if I should just bring the journal and let her read it during our appointment. Or what to do? Any suggestions you guys and gals could give me would be of great help. Not sure how to handle this.",Should I Share My Journal With My Therapist?

You don't need meds, you just have to believe in yourself, and find yourself a girlfriend, and you're fixed. Like really Sherlock? Change my mindset? Never thought of that. Girlfriend? My problems are way more serious, and getting a girlfriend won't solve it. She basically thinks she can talk my way out of depression. I still remember the time like 1 and a half year ago when a doctor told me I should go to therapy, and she was like:You don't need it I can help you myself. Like the fuck does it even mean? I can help you myself, seriously? She's just making things worse. I know she's doing her best, but the ridiculosity of her statments just makes me wanna hit the wall. She's trivializing my problems, and acts like she can cure them by just talking to me. It's making me even more mad, and her tries of talking to me leave me fuming.",My mom thinks she can cure my depression by herself.

Everyday I wake up and I feel like there is no purpose to wake up, I just wanna lay in bed all day and just go to sleep forever. Like what is the purpose of living if I don’t enjoy any of it.

2022-11-16 15:59:02,depression,"I grew up in s cult and struggled with feelings of depression, suicidal thoughts etc all my life. When I left the organization, it felt like a huge weight was taken from my chest and the next years did feel a lot better, albeit confusing at times. 

Leaving the organization unfortunately also meant being shunned by members, which includes close family. It is a constant pain that will not go away. I was able to cope for many years; I have a lot of discipline, eat well, exercise hard, learn difficult things etc. But I did have periods of depression and deep sadness from time to time. My cat helped me go through these. 

She was my best friend for 20 years and I had to say goodbye at the beginning of this year. I have never felt so lonely. She has been dead for more than half a year now, and instead of better, it gets worse. I catch myself wondering if I would see her again if I am dead.

I stream during the night and sometimes I’m loud and my mom tells me that I need to do something with myself cause I don’t do anything. It’s not that I don’t want a job, I have social anxiety so it can be very intimidating. I know I’m letting my mom down and It makes me feel like crappy even more.

When I was a kid, I became depressed and started overeating to make myself feel better. Naturally, I soon became overweight. I was dumb, so I thought that starving myself would be a good way to lose the extra pounds quickly. I would go as long as I could without eating to practice. 

One day, I just stopped feeling hungry. It's been years since and I still never get hungry and can go for days without eating. My stomach will growl, but I never feel hunger pangs. 

I actually have a strong appetite because binging makes me feel less sad and anxious. I overeat almost every day, and I'm borderline obese as a result. Food is my only coping mechanism and I find it difficult deal with everyday life without overeating. When I can't overeat, I feel really agitated and unhappy. I think that I hide behind my weight too. It gives me this ""protective"" feeling that I can't really describe. 

Being overweight has cost me a lot. I wasted most of my adolescence rotting away in my room because I was too self-conscious to socialize with others. Also, I know that my parents and family are disappointed in my bad choices.

My depression is better now, but the feeling hasn't returned. I haven't gone to the doctor or told anyone that I know because this situation is ridiculous. It should be so easy for me to fix my life, but I'm too apathetic to care. 

Has this happened to anyone else?",Lost the Ability to Feel Hunger
2022-11-16 15:43:11,depression,"I’m not sure what to do anymore. I’m so lost in this world. I genuinely can’t stand it being here anymore. I don’t see a reason to live here for myself. I do it to stay for others. I thought I was getting better and I’ve been working on trying to get better. Recently about a few weeks ago I started to feel really down. I noticed a change in my attitude and just the way I was doing everything. I stopped doing my homework and stopped caring. I would fall asleep right after school and just be knocked out cold. I feel so alone. I feel so scared and just terrible. I’d be lying if I said I didn’t want a s/o but Ik it’s not right for me to have one with this mentality. I just miss the feeling of having someone there and being able to express my love for someone. The thought of a relationship seems so nice and beautiful but also terrifies me. My last relationship started off pretty normal and was actually great, I felt loved for once. It all changed when I got SA by the guy. It haunts me till this day. At first I cried and felt so disgusted with myself and then I began to push it away. Recently in these couple of weeks, flashbacks and memories came pouring in and when I see him at school I psychically feel sick. I end up breaking down and feel so scared. No one knows that this has happened to me other than a few close friends. But I can’t help it and tell my mom. Trust me I’d love to be able to tell her but Ik it would hurt her. She’s been though a similar thing as a kid. She would be heart broken to find out that she has tried to be protective of me and still managed to get sexually assaulted. Idk how to tell her that her daughter has been through so much fucking pain. Whenever I try opening up to get about anything she self victimizes and says “atleast you weren’t SA”… that’s when I get quiet and start sobbing. I want to so badly scream at her that I have been. That I’ve been though the same fucking thing. That I need help. I need so much help and want to not remember a single thing. If I can take back the moment that I’ve met this guy I would have. I feel like it’s all my fault for getting SA. Some part of me still feels like a I want him to like me. It’s almost as if I miss him, but the side where we actually had fun. I miss the times we actually spent time together and didn’t turn things sexual. My life rn feels like a disaster. I’ve been crying for a straight week every night. I feel like no one cares for me. I haven’t gone to school in 3 days and I just can’t manage to pass this year. I can tell I’m getting horribly sick again. I want to be able and graduate at ease but with all these overwhelming feelings I don’t know if that’s possible. I really need a hug, I need to be able to cry into someone and just be comforted. I need help, I can’t live like this anymore. I’m trying so hard to find a way to want to stay here but nothing is convincing me. I can tell that I’m slowly losing myself again.",I beginning to get worse again

2022-11-16 15:26:06,depression,"I think I'm depressed. I feel apathetic fairly often, really down sometimes. But here's the scary af thing. I forget things quickly, and it feels like my thinking is somehow not working right. Sometimes my words come out wrong, or I can't think of the right word. Often I momentarily forget why I visited a website or was doing something. Sometimes I forget what I was going to do. Sometimes... I even mess up when handwriting. Sometimes my balance is slightly off. What's wrong with that? I'm really afraid it's dementia. Logically, it's probably depression x hypochondria- I'm 14, have OCD (including pure o, and no i'm not being quirky, i feared for my life for a year), have been suicidal as a kid under 9 (!), lack a family history of dementia AFAIK, and live in a rather dysfunctional household. But I'm not always that upset- I often feel like everything's just fine, and that I'm not depressed, which gives more credibility to the spooky dementia theory.

As this same rapper has said, “I’m always where the sun don’t shine,” this is where I thrive and only feel comfortable, but also miserable to the point of questioning the worth life has to offer. Late at night, I live through every scenario life has to offer in my path, graduating with a master’s degree, working a 9 to 5 job, and saving money to buy a house to raise a family in. But millions of others live this same life, so what makes my life so special from the rest? I always wanted to aspire to be better than my peers, but there is no guide in life that will tell you, “here is the way to outshine the rest.” As I sit at night, drinking to the point of finding a conclusion to happiness, only worsening the anxiety of death and an empty lead life, when will I find meaning? Do not get my words twisted, I am grateful for the beautiful family, friends, and a girlfriend I possess, but how do I convince myself this is enough? Some people might say find religion to give purpose, but what’s the point of having faith, when at the end of the night faith does not recognize the loneliness and despair felt before closing your eyes? When will faith alter my mind to believe in happy endings without knowing demise can be around the corner? Some even might say to enjoy the little things, but the little things are never lasting, always leading me back to my room to be by myself wondering why I can’t be normal. But normal these days has taken a different meaning, focusing on only making yourself better until you feel secure enough to help others. You might think to yourself that makes sense, but in our society, it means to gather wealth, well-being, and solitude before feeling the slightest remorse for others. All I feel is remorse for others than myself, and to be honest, I will gladly worsen my health to put on a face that those can see until they change their well-being to become greater than they could ever imagine. This is my purpose, as others rise, I will fall, and I am fine with this end. As the curtain closes on my story, other stories will blossom in remembrance of the impact I had on them. You might be thinking at this point, are you suicidal? Never, but I will do what I find necessary to keep my mind in check worsening my physical being, providing to those deserving of second chances at a meaningful life. I will provide until the reaper calls my name, then I will feel at peace while others live until the reaper eventually has them join me. I hope you understand how I feel, and if you feel the same, do not worry, you will always have me in your corner to fight the devil within you.

And I'm saddened and angry at life that somewhere right now this person is thriving in life and in a happy healthy relationship and she destroyed me getting to that point. And even though this ended months ago, even though I know she was awful and toxic af, it still eats at me and I don't know how to fully move on yet

This began in 2018 when we first met. I guess to being things, I should say that I'm kind of a loner for good reason. She was my first real best friend since the ending of a very abusive manipulative relationship I was in for five years, that took me two years to recover from. I did recover and was feeling great again when we met. We were besties before long, life partners as she liked to call it. But even then in the back of my mind I knew I was bringing more to the table then than she was. I drove we everywhere, did her errands all time, hung out when she had a bad day, but she could never reciprocate. Still, just being the loner and textbook people pleaser I was, I let that thought stay in the back of my mind where it was. Then one day we went out for lunch. I had a Crohn's flareup, which sometimes makes my brain mush and unable to think/speak real well. We were talking about the NFL kneeling controversy that was going on at the time and because of my flare-up, I simpky said I didn't want to talk about it at that moment. She reacted by storming off and hiding in the bathroom of the restaurant we were at for 30 minutes. When she did come back, I drove her home. The entire time her calling me a piece of shit, an asshole and saying my deceased father would be ashamed of me. When I asked her to stop talking to me like that because it brought back bad memories of my abusive ex, all of a sudden I was the bad guy. This was the first time our friendship ended

Fast forward a few months and because I'm an idiot, I took her back (she didn't apologize for what she did btw, that would become a trend). This where I seemed to start noticing a cycle where it seemed like she was just using me for companionship in between her relationships when she was bored and lonely. We hung out all the time and talked all the time again until she found a new guy and disappeared for three months, coming back only after things went south with that guy. We went to the mall to go shopping one day and she asked how I felt about her dating again to which I said ""you can date whomever you want whenever you want."" Apparently that was enough for her to throw a tantrum at the mall, throw a pair of jeans at me and again, call me an asshole the whole time I drove her home. This is the second time our friendship ended

Fast forward again about a year and we start hanging out again (no apologies from her, again) and we go through the same cycle. Get really close, talk all the time, then she meets a guy and disappears, during which time I struggled with the death of another close friend and being hated by that friends family (we went through cancer together years before, I was the one that survived). After months of silence she shows up again, flirting with a different guy now because that other relationship had since ended. One day she tickled me as a joke so a few weeks later I returned the favor, tickling her as a joke. She stated she was uncomfortable, compared me to a sex offender for doing that and as ""punishment"" refused to talk to me for two weeks and would get snippy at me just for asking why she wasn't talking to me. I walked away yet again (and you'd think I'd learn my lesson after three times now, right?)

Wrong. Two years pass and it's now late 2021 and we start talking again. This time around, I'm struggling with kidney failure and working to move out the following year and get away from my toxic home life at the time (I've since passed my therapy sessions and my kidneys are in good health AND did get my own place 😎) however, I was depressed AF while this was going on. And even though all the countless times I sat and listened to her issues she tells me that I can't talk to her about my depressing stuff anymore and cancels our plans 5 consecutive times to hang out with her latest boyfriend (sidenote, she is totally one of those girls who likes to say ""all men are terrible"" yet can't go five minutes without one). So me, seeing where this is going by now, decide to focus on me; on my education, on my health and manifesting my own place, which I had been working towards for so long. Out of nowhere she comes in, disregards all of that, and say I'm not bringing enough to the friendship because I had been focused on me. Hell, even when I point out that she said I couldn't talk to her about stuff like that anymore, she conveniently doesn't remember it. Lol and behold, she uses this as an excuse to throw a tantrum and not talk to me. So I walked away again

I've since deleted my Facebook, erased my social presence, closed any and all doors for her to walk into my life again. But it feels cruel, wrong even, that somewhere out there she's enjoying happiness and I'm stuck here, now five months since our friendship ended depressed and alone. It's not her that i miss, not by a long shot, but just having anyone around for that matter. She, as well as my toxic family and toxic ex are the reason why I don't trust people. She is the reason why I keep to myself and why I'm so terrified to let anyone else into my life again. Why does she get to be happy when she destroyed me? Why is life so fucking cruel and unfair like this? I know it shouldn't bother me and believe me I'm trying so hard to find a way to move on but I am struggling. Part of me really hopes she gets what she deserves one day but I know she won't. Life doesn't work like that. Life doesn't give a shit about people like me. I just don't know what to do anymore and find myself fantasizing about one day telling her off for all that she did to me, as sad and pathetic as that is. I just don't know what to do and while I lay here restless tonight, I needed to get this off my chest to hopefully, maybe find some peace and some rest tonight. Because there is no one else around to listen

2022-11-16 13:43:23,depression,"I’m sorry my thoughts will probably sound very disjointed and incoherent, I’m having a major emotional and mental breakdown right now and I’m dissociating quite badly.

I’ve been seeing my therapist since early 2017. My main issues for going were trauma caused by a breakup and childhood abandonment by my alcoholic mother when I was 12.

My therapist has been a really kind and caring person for as long as I’ve been working with her. I trusted her more than probably anyone else I knew for most of my life. I formed a very strong attachment with her. There ended up being strong transference, maternal and other kinds on my part. She suggested early on that we lean into it and use it as an experience to help heal from the past traumas.

She was always very caring expressively and outwards and was always supportive. We always had a very strong bond. 

A few months ago I started feeling disconnected and as though my therapist was not showing that she cared about me very often. I brought this up and we sort of talked it out a couple months ago and she said she was not emotionally abandoning me. I thought it would get better from there but nothing really changed and I still have been struggling with feeling disconnected.

My apologies as my thoughts will likely seem more disjointed from here so I will try to organize them as best I can.

\-she said she has been purposely being less expressive and less emotional in sessions. She said this is to be more objective and to better do her job. 

\-she also said she had set that as a boundary because that’s what is best for her. I assume this is because she used to take on clients problems too much and feel burned out. She explained to me at one point a few years ago that she used to feel like it was her job to take care of her friends and essentially “save” them and would feel overwhelmed. I’m assuming the same thing was playing out with me/her clients.

\-examples I gave of how she seems detached is that she rarely ever shows much emotion at all anymore. She doesn’t offer supportive comments or praise like she used to, things like “I’m here for you” “I’m proud of you” etc.

\-more examples – things feeling very mechanical and detached. She doesn’t ask me about my life or how things that are important to me went that we’ve discussed. Basically there’s no kind of rapport anymore at all. I said it feels like she doesn’t talk to me like I’m a person anymore. She doesn’t show much empathy. I said it feels like I’m talking to a dentist.   
   
 

\-she said she was not willing to do anything to come to a solution or resolve those issues, or adjust at all or change in anyway to make those things better. She said that was her boundary and she could not be flexible about it. To me this seems like a misuse of what the nature of “boundaries” actually are and is just an excuse to not work together or even see if a solution is possible. 

\-she told me a couple months ago she wasn’t emotionally abandoning me or shutting me out. I told her it seems like that actually is happening and that she has a complete wall up and that she has completely withdrawn showing that she cares for me and etc

\-in the past when we’ve had issues connecting, I told her we used to talk things out and see if we could come to a mutual understanding and balance things out.

\-she said she was not willing to change her boundary. She said there was nothing to balance out or discuss. She even said I wasn’t asking for anything unreasonable, but that she had to do what was best for her. She was not willing to discuss potential solutions or ways to resolve this. She basically said “yeah I’m more disconnected now, that’s how it is. Sorry it hurts you.”

I trusted her so much. She was supposed to be the one safe person who wouldn’t do this to me. Instead she’s recreating the exact same dynamic that my mom and ex girlfriend did, abandoning me emotionally through no fault of my own, and without much of an explanation. Because she even said she didn’t think she should explain why she set that boundary.

I hate myself so much for allowing this to happen to me. I trusted her that she would never hurt me like this. Instead I’m reliving the most painful experience of my life yet again, after she assured me that she would never hurt me or abandon me or do what the people who hurt me and broke my trust did to me. I don’t know what to do and I can’t take this.",My therapist encouraged me to be attached to her as a way to heal my traumatic experiences. Now she’s abandoning me. I’m on the verge of deciding to not live anymore. Please god someone help me.

POC. if it matters to anyone. I was officially diagnosed with depression a little over a year ago and even though there have been some pockets of happiness here and there, in general I seem to be getting worse. I’m on two medications and I see a therapist weekly. She’s amazing. I have a great family and a loving partner and honestly they’re the only reason I’m still alive at this point. But I still feel an overwhelming sense of dread and hopelessness. A gray cloud lingers over my head and only seems to be getting darker. I’m honestly tired of it. Just merely existing is exhausting for me. Sometimes I just want to disappear. 

Anyway, I’ve been an inpatient at a psychiatric unit once and it didn’t really do much but give me another $2,000 bill I still need to pay. Thanks for nothing I guess… I’ve been struggling to find work ever since I graduated from college, but damn this job market is tough. I’ve even tried broadening my search and trying different career paths. But nothing. Just working a bunch of dead end part-time jobs. (Getting full-time has been difficult). I’m behind on all my bills, loan payments, I moved back in with my mom and now I’m putting her through the stress of watching my mental health deteriorate. I feel incredibly guilty. Got declined from a few more jobs. That’s life I guess. But playing this game of life is getting old and I think I’m officially done playing. I can sense that I’m nearing the end, and it’s both scary and a relief. Scary being the unknown that is what happens after death. A relief because I hope after it’s all over I’ll finally be free. I hope what awaits me on the other side is peace and happiness. God, what I would give to feel that again. For the record, me struggling to find a job and my financial issues wasn’t the catalyst for my depression. But it sure does make it a hell of a lot worse.

This can include video games, exercise, sex life, etc.. things that I would usually really enjoy and look forward to. I have been with my fiance for over 7 years now since I was 14 and she has made a major impact on my mental health in a positive way, she has shown me that it's okay to let out my thoughts and emotions that I would usually keep to myself which helps a bit. I have also noticed that I have slowly started to sleep later and later not wanting to get up, I work a 9-5 so I need to be up at a certain but going from exercising in the morning feeling good and feeling of taking on the day down to barely being able to get out of bed has been such a mental struggle.

It turns into something angry, something sad.

After having a shitty day at school and being bullied all the time, I can just put my headphones on and blast some Korn or TOOL just whatever takes my mind off it. But when I don't have music playing, I feel empty. I have nothing. It's the only thing that makes me feel something, but it's never happiness. When I listen to music I don't feel empty, i don't feel happy, but I feel content. Content with my life.

I’m 29 and haven’t worked more than a year and a half in my entire life. I don’t have any marketable skills because I end up melting down or falling into a pit of despair. All I can do is play some crappy piano music, and even then, I’m too anxious to perform well. I bring nothing to the table  except needs with no returns. I don’t have any value. I’m just a black hole that sucks up other people’s effort, emotional bandwidth, and money. 

What the fuck is holding me back?? What do I have to live for? Everyone tells me that I have people that care about me and that I’m part of a community, but never realize that I only exist on the sidelines of other people’s lives. Most of my friends are fortunate to have partners, roommates, or children that shape the everyday meaning of their lives. As loved as I am when people are around, I spend the rest of my time on the shelf waiting for my next turn to feel love. What should be an everyday part of my emotional sustenance is instead left to anomaly. I don’t have a life. I just have a side role in everyone else’s lives with no character development. 

I don’t feel like a person. I feel like an observer that the cast sometimes talks to. My role is passive at best. What am I so afraid of? My life hasn’t, and won’t, go anywhere. I’m always going to be my parents’ pet invalid. I only make the lives of everyone around me harder. It might hurt them at first, but I genuinely believe my death would be a net positive for the world.",What is death and why does it scare me? I have my poison but am hesitant

2022-11-16 11:53:44,depression,"I’m 24 years old and after 3 years of doing long distance, my bf (25) just got out of the army and moved 25-30 minutes to the city by me. He knows I struggle with depression but lately it’s been kind of worse. I still live at home and I’m a little jealous he has his own place and is living it up in the city. I’m even more jealous because he’ll be going out a lot on the weekends with friends. I can see him whenever and go out with him in the weekends when I feel like it though. I still live at home with my parents mainly because I’ve been in school and the only jobs I’ve done are babysitting ones so I don’t have a ton of money. Anyways, I feel like I’m holding him back even though I know I’m not? Does this make sense? Maybe I’m afraid I’ll ruin his life. Im afraid to be in a bad mood around him because he’s a very normal guy and I don’t want to ruin his new start out of the army. He doesn’t really understand anxiety attacks or how to help me. He’s experienced some depression brought on by life events but mine is just random and I’ve had it since I was 15 years old. Then I feel like I’m being clingy and I just want him to take care of me but I know that’s not how relationships should work.. this is missing some context but just wondering if anyone has been in a relationship with someone who doesn’t really understand mental illness. How do I tell him how he can help me without making it seem like I NEED him to take care of me? I don’t need anyone to take care of me but then I feel like I’m asking too much of him.

2022-11-16 11:52:20,depression,"I'm too incompetent for being alive. I am fundamentally defective. It feels that everyone instinctively knows how to live life more or less correctly, and I'm completely lost. Every day I'm painfully aware of the feeling that I'm living my life wrong, and I could be so much more content if I knew what to do and I had some combination of the right traits, the right mindset or attitude, the right skills. I don't need to be perfect--at this point I just want to be functional. Just about everything that I am is maladapted to the world around me and incompatible with my own desires, to the point that I am helpless and I fail at and suffer with every aspect of life.

It's difficult to convey the extent of it. I can't take care of my body or mind right, I don't understand or care about my health enough to fix anything that's wrong with me. I struggle to attend to all manners of practical, financial, and social responsibilities. I don't know how to find clothes that I want to wear. I don't know how to find food that I want to eat and that doesn't make me feel sick. I can't bond with and maintain relationships with my family right. I can't find people who care about the same things that I do. I can't make friends, I can't interact with the people that I know right. I can't find love, and it's utterly foreign to me how to make that work.

My passions and interests have always been the most important things in my life, but I can't make myself care enough about them to follow through with them and accomplish anything, to meaningfully improve in them and become truly great at them, or even to engage in them at all more than a few times a year, however much I spend the days thinking about them and wishing I had the energy and drive for them. I can't properly learn anything at more than a barely applicable mediocre level. I can't finish anything, I can't see anything through. I regularly feel despair observing other people who do things that take actual specialization and talent, people doing meaningful or useful things, doing things they want to do, actually living their lives and interacting with the world.

I wish I was singlemindedly driven towards something, anything. I wish I was someone with initiative and motivation and energy and confidence, the kind of person who has their life planned out. I wish I actually cared about any particular career path. I wish that I followed some passion of mine, however unrealistic. But my indecisiveness and apathy has ruined my life. Everything points to an empty future of struggling to just barely function enough to subsist. No way of living feels right to me, I'm never sure of anything enough to commit to it, and nothing I feel I want feels to ever be within my reach so as to be worth bothering with. I can't focus on the things that are meaningful to me enough for it to matter. I simply give up on everything. An artist that does not create is not an artist. Thinking about the things that you care about is not the same as experiencing them. The years slip by this way without anything to show for myself or to look back on.",Too incompetent for living

People ask me what I want to do for a job and I have no clue and I’m not in the age where I have time, no my time is running out. Most of my peers are/have graduated college and I haven’t even finished one years worth. I lose interest in whatever I major in and give up. I feel so worthless. I can’t make decisions for myself unless they’re small decisions like take out the trash, do the dishes etc. but to me those don’t even feel like decisions, they feel like autopilot taking control and saying this is what you need to do so let’s do it. My boyfriend wants to get a house together and I do too but I have no ambition to do the work to get a house and I can tell it bothers him. Am I just pure lazy? My boyfriend knows what he wants to do with the rest of his life but I just play it day by day. I get a job because it’s convenient and it’s there, i do things to make myself happy because I know it’s what I’m supposed to do, I buy groceries because that’s what society tells me to do. I don’t make choices based on what I want because I don’t know what I want. I struggle picking what to eat for dinner. I would much rather let someone else pick and eat something maybe I don’t want than pick on my own. Those questions you always get about where do you see yourself in 10 years have always been so hard for me because before I hit adulthood, I didn’t see myself making it past 16. Then I couldn’t see myself making it past 18. But I have. Somehow I keep aging and I don’t know why.

2022-11-16 11:27:48,depression,"I was diagnosed with depression, chronic fatigue and general anxiety at the age of 16. I'm in  Scotland, so thankfully help is free, but has very long waiting lists and very few experts.

My mind is currently circling the drain of oblivion. You know. That cold familiar place, void of life and expression, that's somehow comforting, and yet draining at the same time?

Well after about 6 months of a somewhat, calm, and almost ""neuro-typical"" life:
Making it in to my college classes
minimal emotional ""outbursts""
fairly successful meds with little to no side effects
and even successfully maintaining my relationships, including my fiancé, who I have consistently upset or disappointed in the past . 
I'm back... Or at least I can recognise I'm very close to our old friend, the black dog. Or as I call it, my void cage. 

It started with my dad visiting my partner and I. I'm a bit of a perfectionist you see, then ended with my partner breaking off our engagement, and me distraught over my own actions and behaviour. All the while my dad just not understanding where it came from and very concerned.

I'll try keep this as short as possible as it's been a very long day as well as a lot of rubbish adding to the bin fire. 

I get awakened by a phone seller, who was rather insistent I get the latest thing. 
My dad and I wanted to go out. It's pouring with rain. So I nip out as quickly as possible to get us some brunch. 
My lecturer emails me saying I haven't finished enough work to pass my first block, and so has given me a deadline of December 1st to finish all of my work missing, or I may be unable to finish the course and move on to higher education. I panic.
Gas runs out. I let the partner know, as we are super tight on cash. He tells me he must have forgot to put in the £5 from the card (old card meters for energy) so I put it on the account. Relax a bit to an actual warm flat.
So game with my dad and spend some really nice, massively missed, quality gaming time with my dad (was Space Hulk: Tactics) and the day flies by after that.
Parter comes home. No dishes are done, nor food for dinner planned. He gets urked and makes a comment, half cutting joke, half serious. I brush it off. So he tells me I'm being lazy.
This is were the bickering starts from me. 
I snap at everything and can't stop the feeling of betrayal. 
I manage to talk it out as my partner made everyone dinner, and my dad nudges me to calm tf down (not his words but jist) and just try to focus on my food and then tasks ahead. Also to stop being a c*nt (Scottish so it's ok to say that as an, OY moment)
I manage and apologize to partner and dad. 
But carry on with minor digs in 'jest' but I'm still salty.
Then once I calm down, he picks up where I left off, and confronts me in front of my dad about how I can't get away with that kind of behaviour. I completely down play what's going on by putting up the emotional block/wall. 
Then after a while of us angrily telling each other how we wronged the other, he decides, drunkenly at this point, that he's sleeping in the kitchen... The kitchen. To which my dad gives me a befuddled look and calmly asks ""can you try talk to him about that?"" I couldn't deal with it. Something in me just went into fight mode after that.

Whilst he tries to get his clothes for tomorrow from our bedroom, as he has work at 9am, and at this point it's like 11/12ish?am, I try talking to him, and immediately get on the offensive when he doesn't see my point and focuses on his hurt. 
I go in to the bedroom fully now, and start leaning against the wall, telling him he's not getting to sleep in the kitchen, and should just take the bed, as I will sleep on the couch. He didn't listen and went to go past me.
I push him away. A lot.
He tries to pick me up, I push him off.
He tries to bear hug me, and I push again, failing this time, we struggle and I rip his t-shirt that he got as a gift from his mum and his necklace ... He tries again for the handle, and then I bite. His. Arm.
Why? God damn it. Why did I do that to HIM?! 
So he gets through after I start to go limp at the reality crashing on me, the fight dissipates fast and hard, adrenaline lacking hits like a brick. Wtf did I just do?

And so, after calling his mother and confirming he wants nothing to do with me now, rightfully so, here we are. 

I'm not looking for pitty, but some understanding or insight into if anyone has a similar experience, and how to de-escalation myself before the fight or flight mode/adrenaline kicks in would be great...

I have a plan to move forward, and will, but by Lucifer, this gut feeling and void encroachment won't go. It's been 3 hours of 'calm' after a massive bout of feeling helpless, then victimised, then shame and now cruel, undeserving of love or affection.

They were the first person to show me what it feels like to love, as well as a whole plethora of beautiful feelings. 
Now it's just pain.



TL:DR: I hurt my fiancé due to me indulging in my unstable emotional state and irritation. We both hurt, and he has called off the engagement, as well as having anything to do with me. Why am I like this, and what can I do to improve myself?",Why can't I just control myself?

But I kinda brushed it aside thinking oh its probably nothin. Then it got worse. I eventually got separated from my entire family and was placed in a foster home for a few years. Eventually moved back in with my mom after an attempt to run away from my foster family. Thats when things got really bad. I would eat how ever much I wanted when I wanted. I gain over 150+ pounds in under 6 months. about a year goes by and I decide to go to a therapist to get some mental help. But this did not work at all. maybe I was just stuborn or I was just to far gone at that point. A couple months later I started to contemplate what I was doing with my life. I decided to get the fuck up and try to do something with my life. So I got a job bought a gym membership and started going 4-6 times a week just hoping that this would help take my mind off the stress of day to day life. but it only worked for a period of time. Eventually I got a girlfriend and she cheated on me after 2 weeks of being together and that just absolutely shattered me. I lost all motivation and started to slack off in my work and just stopped going to the gym period. I got so low that I would cut my arms to get my mind off of the mental pain of life. But about a week later I met another girl at work who was very kind to me and was very uplifting. I always feel 1 million times better after talking to her and finally feel a bit happy for a little bit. but then eventually she goes to sleep and I have no one to vent to. And then the thoughts come rushing back in. I eventually walk to the kitchen grab a knife and make another cut so I can finally feel something other then mental pain. From the point of me getting a gf to that last sentence has been me for the past month to month and a half. and it is currently 2:30 am and im contemplating just walking into that kitchen for 1 last time and ending it all.

She’s already in therapy so she’s fighting it and working on it but I just don’t want her to harm herself. I am at a loss, it’s really messing with me but I am not going to jump ship. I love her and want to be with her and want to see her get better but I just need help with coping and ways I can help. Thanks","My girlfriend struggles with bad depression, how do I help her"

2022-11-15 14:35:47,depression,"This is my first time posting and honestly I’ve never been sure if I’ve been depressed.  In all honesty I’ve never felt a desire to end my life(which I’ve been told is a big part of depression), more like the opposite where I’d like to live forever.  However even then I’ve never really felt any sort of drive within life.  I only do activities due to a societal need to do them.  My entire goal throughout school was and has been to put as little effort in as possible to achieve my goal.  Even now in college I don’t have any drive to study or put effort into my classes even though I should.  I do have some post-college arbitrary goal, that being a programming job, but it is purely for the money/effort ratio, and not for an actual desire to work in the field.  

The biggest kicker was recently when a girl I went on a date with said I showed no signs of romance, as despite really liking her, I had no drive to escalate anything.  This really made me self reflect (despite not even being the biggest problem in my life imo). I don’t even think I could even function in a relationship due to this, and in all honestly I feel I’d be better off without .  Really though I feel that I lack any expressive emotions, with even my closest friends saying I rarely smile and show emotions, as well as my extremely monotone voice.  

I just feel so lost in the world.  I really lack any sort of feelings towards anyone in my life (possibly due to a rough upbringing that I’d not like to get into).  I do think about stuff a lot, and know if I put in the effort I could go far in life.  I really just don’t though.  I’ll lay in bed all day with no desire to do anything and still feel contempt.  What are possibly the greatest days of my life just roll on by and I couldn’t feel an ounce of regret.  I feel as though I am observer of life, destined for mediocrity at best.",A Life Lacking Purpose; My Personal Rant
2022-11-15 14:19:58,depression,"It took me a very very long time to simply stop expecting strangers on the internet to genuinely care about mental and emotional well-being. I think that Reddit is a cesspool of negativity, and that tons of people can forget that we literally don't know each other at all. I love the freedom that anonymously posting brings me. 

So is it wrong to share your stories? No, but it's worth noting that nobody owes you empathy- and most people don't have empathy. Most people can and will read a post that mentions your depression and be a dick to you for no reason. Fuck those people- and if I say you in real life I'd keep that same energy- but this is just Reddit. Lmao",Don't Be Quick To Judge Yourself
2022-11-15 14:16:54,depression,"I had two friends during my senior year of high school. I stopped talking to the first after she kept insulting me for being depressed, culminating in her telling me I looked like a school shooter after I finally tried to take care of myself and shaved. Me and the second friend just stopped texting each other one day. I was afraid he didn't want to deal with me anymore, and I guess he didn't. I haven't had a friend in the years since. I've gotten a job, enrolled in college, started taking care of myself, and yet I still feel too scared to make friends.

I fear that I'm socially inept. I fear that I'll be a burden because of my mental health stuff. I fear that I'll get hurt again when they inevitably stop talking to me. I fear that I'll hurt them, that I'm too emotionally needy to hold up my end of a friendship, that I'll take but never give. I fear that I straight up don't deserve friends. 

So even after I've made my life objectively better, every day still goes the same. I wake up. I work. I interact only with my co-workers. I come home. I log into my class and do the work. I get tired, walk into an empty room, flop onto an empty bed, don't even bother checking my phone before I plug it in, and lay down and get crushed by this horrible silence. Then I turn on the TV just for the noise, and I fall asleep.

It could be much worse. I know that. But I still hate how lonely every day feels. I have nobody to be better for besides myself, and that doesn't really help me get through the days.",It's so lonely.

I snap at them if they talk to me. I don't want to talk to parents.

I can't take any of these restrictions. I over heard my mum and brother talking today. My brother who I love so much was saying how shit I treat her.

2022-11-15 13:55:55,depression,"This is a lot. I just feel like I need help and I'm afraid that my negative thoughts are going to scare away my few friends that I really care about because this has been going for quite a while and nothing is making it better.

I've been married to my highschool sweetheart for 10 years in a few days and I have been with her for over 15. She really is the person for me, but I have some fucked up parts that weren't compatible with my life. A few years into dating my wife, I cheated on her. No clue what my reasoning was, but I got away with it and it was a thing I internalized as a way to feel good with minimal consequence (in my mind at the time). We had a great relationship for a lot of years and she was my person, despite my moronic choices.

I had one other time as an unmarried man that I gave in to temptation with an ex that was in need of comfort. I got away with this one too.

We got married and I joined the armed forces after college. She was ready to follow me on an uncertain life and I was selfishly pursuing a way forward that gave my life purpose without thinking about her self actualization. We weathered some rough times together and moved several times, as is the standard with that way of life. 

Somewhere along the way, she become depressed to add to the anxiety that she had been dealing with for years. Fortunately(?), she was able to get drugs to help ease the depression. Unfortunately, these also killed her sex drive. Our sex life dried up almost entirely with my advances meeting rejection 9 times out of 10. After about four years of this, with our sex life getting to the point of only a time or two in a year, I ventured back into the option of others.

I met a few people that I cheated with. I justified it because I felt that I needed a sexual outlet, but I never really talked about the taboo subject of my sex life with the woman that I was still in love with; a fucking childish approach to a marriage with cracks starting to form. I started to decide that leaving her might be my best chance for happiness. This might be a good time to mention that I have been depressed for even longer than I have been with my wife and I have never been able to anchor down on anything that can help me. As you may see above or below, I tend to look to external sources of blame rather than trying to fix my own problems. 

After a few years of occasional infidelity, I met a girl that plucked my heart strings. She was incredible to me and I thought that I had found a justification to leave. She was also seeing someone else at the same time and strung me along for a few months, leaving me false hope. 

During this period, I decided to tell my wife that I wanted to separate. This conversation led to my desire to divorce coming out (since I thought other people would make me happier). She was blindsided and shattered and needed to know why. After some journal reading inference, she confronted me and I told her about my infidelity. It started with the small details, but I eventually told her everything. She was devastated and I finally got to see what a monster I was and how much I was able to hurt someone that I loved. I still pressed on with going to divorce as a means to find long-term happiness because obviously the problem with my life was my wife and not me, right?

A few months and a move later, she finds a guy that she likes (we are still married and living together for economic reasons). I find a few meaningless flings with strangers as well as some interesting connections, but nothing romantic since that isn't what I'm interested in. Over a few months, I start to realize that sex isn't what I am after, I just am constantly looking for a quick fix to the self-hate that I live in constantly. Feeling another person satisfies that need for a little bit, but it never lasts. I start to recognize that I have made some incredible missteps.

She has  now fallen in love (or something damn close to it) and is maybe better off without me, especially with my history of being a piece of shit. And I am in an empty apartment most nights, trying to fight off my thoughts. I have a reasonably healthy sex life, but that doesn't bring me any lasting joy. All I can do is regret my life and envy this new guy that gets the best of my wife who is now off the meds that killed her libido. 

She doesn't care about me at all. She is fully wrapped up in this new guy and I feel like I've fully lost her, but I want to be back in her life. I struggle with sleeping because I retrace all of my errors and how much hurt I have created. 

I am angry now; a feeling that I didn't really have before. I snap at small things and I am critical at things that don't matter. I almost constantly think about what it would be like to not be here. To not have to deal with this pain and the consequences of my fuck ups. I stopped drinking because it exacerbated my feelings, but then I had a bad day and I started drinking again and here I am. Thinking about how meaningless and painful my life has been. I have nothing to look forward to. Tomorrow doesn't get better for the foreseeable future and there are so many ways it can get worse. I'm worried where I will go with this with enough time steeping in this mental state.

I don't have anyone to talk to and I can't even seek professional help since my profession is very, very against mental health issues and I will lose my livelihood if I cry for help. I tried an anonymous source of help that the military offers and I was ghosted twice by the doctors that I was connected with. I just feel lost and I sometimes wish that something would just come along and erase me and make this all easier on everyone.

This is long. Not sure if anyone will actually read it. I know I'm a fuck up and that I have caused incredible pain to people that I love. I'm not a lovable protagonist of my story. I just need something and I'm not sure what that something is, but I am hoping one of you has the something that helps me get out of this darkness.

then i realized how much insanely harder it hit me when i couldn't do anything that involved getting my life together for REAL when i hit rock bottom. couldn't even finish my A.S in business lmao, i'm 20 now and the pandemic made me such in worse condition, it hit me when i graduated high school and lost all my friends. now i don't know what to do. don't have a path for myself and i've been in and out losing motivation, going to therapy and getting discharged made me lose all hope. worst is i'm trying really hard to not k*ll myself even though i'm so fucking tempted and i even have dreams about it. idk i'm just so tired like what's the point, it probably can't get better",i don't really care anymore

I've had every opportunity handed to me - my car, my apartment, my college education are all gifts from my supportive family. I feel like I'm squandering all of it because of some nonsense going on in my brain. 

I had a wonderful relationship with a man I thought I would marry, and I ended up breaking up with him because I was so sad all the time I was scared he would grow tired of me and leave, and now I worry that he was the only person I really lived for. My family is hundreds of miles away, and I know they love me but I don't think they really like me. I don't think anyone really likes me, not even my now ex. 

I think I'm a waste of the resources that everyone has given me. I don't think I have any real reason to feel this sad, aside from a couple sad things from my childhood but doesn't everyone have those? So many people with so much less than me do so much more with their lives, but I'm just going to be mediocre if I make it past these next few years.

My ability to mask my symptoms comes and goes, and I've been in a downswing for the past few weeks. Its really difficult to collect my thoughts lately and it its frustrating.

Theres this girl (lets call her Abbi) who claims to be my friend. I first met her a bit over half a year ago, and she's in a rough place in life. Her parents werent supportive of her being gay, and she ended up in a young adults halfway house in another state. I've been through a lot of shit and my parents arent in my life either, so I chose to help her out a bit. Ive paid for clothes medications you name it. I don't have a lot of money myself, but I help in the limited ways I can.

Every 2 weeks like clockwork she needs something. And I'm happy to help. But she keeps trying to be my friend and it fucks me up.

Every time she comes by my apartment to pick something up she tells me how she wants to hang out. Reassures me that she cares about me. And not a single time has she followed through on that. I text her to ask if she wants to play mariokart at my apartment or go and do something together and its radio silence. She apologizes several days later, saying she wasn't on her phone or that something else happened. But every 2 weeks on the dot she calls. Every. Single. Time.

I've told her how much this hurts me. That I don't need her to pretend to be my friend. That I just want to help and am not expecting anything from her. But she tells me that she genuinely cares about about me. Now when she says it I just cut her off and tell her to shut up.

I don't know how to describe how much this is torturing me emotionally. To have someone continually tell you they care while never following through on it. I don't want anything. Why can't she just have the respect for me to not fucking lie to me?","""I promise I'm your friend"""

I really want a relationship but i don’t want to have to pretend to be happy around a significant other or constantly bring them down if im honest with how i feel. I just want someone who i can love and care for that will do the same and its frustrates me that depression is getting in the way of that.

Honestly tired of my job, im beyond tired of the extra work. Its a small company that’s been constantly understaffed since Covid started and ive been picking up an insane amount of extra work for years. Owners a great guy and has done a lotttttt for me. He dosent make me do the extra work but if i dont the company will probably go under and if i quit it definitely will so kinda a lot of pressure to do it. I like the field and I possibly want it to be my permanent career(by eventually starting my own company) but with almost 2 years of an insane amount of extra work and stress from being understaffed ive burned out. Also haven’t been able to be promoted and work on the other aspects of the field that id need to know to get off my own due to not having the staff to fill my position, again I just feel stuck.

I stopped caring about a lot of the things/people i used to care about which really fucking suck. I feel like ive always been a caring person so to see that fade away from me makes me feel less human, and like im missing a huge chunk of who i am.

I know it may seem dumb but my cars not running. I have a huge passion for cars and my car is my baby. I have put hundreds of hours into working on it, i feel more alive when i drive it, it feels like its one of the few things that actually makes me happy even if its only for a few seconds. Seeing it’s just sitting there with no progress honestly hurts. Kida reminds me of myself in some sad way. I for some reason even ended up buying my first lottery ticket hoping i could get the money to fix it, even though i know damn well im more likely to be struck by lightning than win it. Honestly feel kinda dumb spending $2 on what might as well be a useless receipt paper. I also feel dumb caring more about a fucking car over other things I really should care about.

Lifes honestly been going slightly better the past few days regardless of everything, today its just hitting hard, feeling extra depressed/lonely, kinda just want a hug tbh. Most of society doesn’t care if a mans sad and lonely tho.

To end things on a happier note i have made some improvements in my life.
Ive now brushed my teeth 3 days in a row, seems like a really dumb thing to be proud of but fuck it. 
Ive gone to the gym every other day for a week and a half, literally just now realized i cant drive there again until i fix my car so that sucks but fuck it i have faith that ill keep it up, i used to be in shape years ago and it definitely helped me mentally so i feel like im fairly determined to get back to it, and i told my buddy to make sure he gives me shit if i dont go.

I cleaned my room which is awesome, i can actually see the floor. I feel like ive been sleeping a little better/allergies have been better too since i vacuumed/dusted.

I bought some stuff for the house to make it look slightly less like a bachelor pad which idk i feel like is progress for some reason.

If you made it to the end for some reason maybe try putting something in your life that’s going good in the comments? Idk it may seem dumb but i feel like it helped just slightly",Depressions hitting pretty hard right now

2022-11-15 12:55:26,depression,"I wonder if I’m the only one sometimes going through all this . Anyway I’m a 35 year old male living in Los Angeles working soon will have my own apartment in a few months because of my autism ( though most people don’t know I’m autistic). I have a roommate currently. I am originally from the sf Bay Area and while I loved it there I needed a change . Weather for one thing and LA just seemed so exciting and it is . Anyway I moved here in 2018 and love it . So I’m happy in the city I live in , but I’m not happy with the circumstances of the last two years and instead of looking back I’m trying to look forward and realize my lie isn’t over and boring and useless. First off I used to go the gym and run and eat healthy, and I was in much better shape  obviously. Than Covid came my work hours changed and so did my diet along with everything else. I work retail so those who work it or have will know exactly what I’m talking about. So in 2022 I tried to restart by going back to being a vegetarian, forcing myself to go back to the gym etc, but my motivation is just not there yet . I do have a small social life so I’m thankful for that and I am also a photographer as I love all the architecture in this city . But I need more friends my age I’m
Guessing and there just seem to be no women who aren’t partiers or who would let me be myself with them . Or maybe I’m looked at as asexual or unattractive. Anyways I just need something more exciting than just work and home . I wish I had a group o could do things with but of course my schedule makes it tough .

My dating/sex history:
I was never very good at asking women out even though most of my life I was told I was extremely handsome I’m tall 6”1 blonde hair , brown eyes . I was told I could have modeled when I was younger . Anyway I didn’t lose my virginity till I was 20 which is late but partly because i was shy , just not confident. I had an opportunity to be that girls boyfriend who I lost my virginity to but I just decided I didn’t want a relationship with her , well between 2007 and 2009 I had no heterosexual sex but desired it but was insecure, etc . I’ll admit because I grew up in San Francisco and had gay friends I even experimented with gay men as a way out since I was just not having relationships with women but I realized obviously I was not gay or bi since I didn’t feel attracted to men . Than I’m 2010 I had sex with a drunk cougar and that was one and done . I had a disasterous date with a woman in the mission district in sf and it was horrible. I than tried going to “ cougar bars” with my friend but of course we would never go home with anyone, and it wasn’t my scene anyway. Than in 2012 I met my first girlfriend who was older than me at a class. Funny thing is I liked her immediately and she clearly liked me . We saw the Batman dark knight movie which was our first date in 2012. Well we fucked like crazy so much so that I felt it was a bit much and the non sexual side of our relationship seemed kinda ehhh….
Well I eventually drove her away and regretted it . And since then I’ve slept with a few older women from 2015-2019. But since Covid I’ve had no sex except masturbation . Partly I still do struggle with being insecure and feeling like Women will never be into me which I know is nonsense of course . But I am now have a strange sense of being torn on one hand I would like to be in a relationship, on the other hand my life is busy enough with work and exploring stuff in LA with my camera . I almost feel like the woman would have to be perfect for me because I feel like maybe my earlier history told me something that I’m just someone who lost their virginity late and because of it maybe it messed me up or maybe I’m better off just with a few friends and my own life . Partly I think I need someone who I can be myself around them without judgment and I’m trying to change . Maybe I’m just to weird or absent minded . I try to work on my confidence and I try to
Fake it till I make it but that can only last so long . I do have confidence issues and while I’m secretive about it deep inside I feel like most women are either judging me or think I’m unattractive , or that I’m gay. 

I guess I need to work on myself . I want to get back into shape , eat healthier, exercise like I used to . Also I use to shave everyday clean shaven and short hair but when Covid came I got lazy. I’m going to try and get myself together and work on myself. I take my medication for depression which helps and I do have a therapist but I can’t see her as much as I’d like . I do have challenges but I always try to work through them 

My issues with sex, relationships, asking women out :
I have often had issues with asking women out , etc. it’s weird maybe I am incel yet I don’t blame my problems on women I blame it all on myself that I’m my own worst enemy. I tend to shoot myself in the foot . It’s weird because I don’t consider myself repressed. I grew up in a liberal household in San Francisco. I also am not a right winger as most incels are . I am liberal . Anyways so most men can ask a woman out with no problem and nothing would faze them . I on the other hand have trouble because I don’t want to make a fool of myself, come off as creepy etc . Good example is there is this customer at work who I like and comes in most everyday . Her and I talk quite a bit when I’m helping her and we smile at each other . And I think she likes me , but probably just being friendly. Two of my colleagues know I like her and always ask “ Have you asked her out yet “ I always give an excuse or that she wouldn’t want to have anything to do with me that way.  So other guys could just ask a woman out with no issue but not me. Also I’m not at my best right now and want to get back to being healthy and exercise. The funny thing is I can talk to beautiful women because I do every day because I work in Beverly Hills and I can engage and be friendly but on my own I don’t seek out to talk to women because of my own fear as how they view me. The funny thing is I did ask my ex gf out but it wasn’t really a “date asking her out it was more casual and things developed. I just wonder if I can overcome these issues that have been plaguing me for a good chunk of my life . I just sometimes feel I’m cursed .",I need to change myself
2022-11-15 12:55:23,depression,"Nobody actually cares about anyone else anymore. Oh, you “care about” me? You’re “worried” for me? No you’re not. You don’t care. Nobody cares.",Why do people pretend to be nice?
2022-11-15 12:53:24,depression,"I know this is related to my depression but I don’t know exactly how. My entire life, I’ve made the media I consume into a core part of my personality. It wasn’t even my choice to begin with though. I used to hide a flashlight under my pillow to read magic tree house and Percy Jackson instead of sleeping as a kid. And my mom would tell everyone about how cute it was that I did that and I just became the “book kid.” I guess it was cute then to be so invested in fictional worlds and characters. But now I’m 22 and I live with my partner in a shit city and none of my friends even live in this state anymore, and I don’t do anything with my life. 

I get so invested in the tv shows and books I interact with. To the point where, when I pause a show or put down a book, I genuinely have to take the time to reacquaint myself with my body and the world around me. I have to remind myself that I am not a person in that world. It’s even worse if I strongly relate to a character because then I latch on to them and I can’t stop viewing everything that happens in my real life through their eyes. “My partner just said this shitty thing. How would X react in this situation?” or “X had this job, so that’s where I’ll apply too.” It’s hard for me to know how I’m actually feeling at any point in the day, so it really is just easier to imagine how this character I relate to would feel. And I spend hours of my day reading fan fiction about whatever my current hyper fixation is.

But it’s all because it feels so good to not be myself in my body or my life. I don’t have to think about how I have to work a shitty job to pay for my shitty apartment. I don’t have to think about any of the terrible people in my life. I can pretend that my world is completely different and I’m someone else. Sometimes it’s genuinely the only coping mechanism that keeps me from spiraling into wild depressive thoughts about how all my loved ones wish I was dead (which I logically know isn’t true). I for real can’t be alone with my own thoughts anymore. 

And I also feel like shit for feeling this way. Because I love my partner and I should feel so lucky to be able to live with them. But I hate this city and I want so badly to live anywhere else. 

This also isn’t maladaptive daydreaming because it’s a conscious effort that I make. Fantasy Prone Personality is the closest thing I’ve ever seen that describes it. Sometimes I wish I had a better imagination and I could act out scenarios from my favorite shows in my mind. But I have to actually be watching or reading something to be able to escape the world I actually live in. I don’t wish I was dead. I just wish so fucking that I lived in any other world but this one. I hate my life.",Fantasy prone personality
2022-11-15 12:46:43,depression,"I 19M have 3 younger brothers and I feel like they have fulfilling lives while I have nothing. I'm 5'8"" and fat, super introverted, I watch anime and play games, I have friends but we live so far away we can never meet up and hang out and I'm not confident enough in my looks to even try to enter a relationship. 

My brothers on the other hand, they are super extroverted and outgoing, great at talking to and entertaining girls, they watch anime and play games as well but their other features make people like them more while it makes people look down on me. My first brother and second brother are 6ft tall and 17 and my other brother is 5'4"" and 14 + they're all skinny and generally stay active. 

My dad is always colder to me in comparison to my other brothers and it really gets to me all the time, the way how he puts in effort to get them what they want while he put off all my things and needs because he doesn't want to spend lots of money on me really affects how I feel about myself. It also doesn't help that he is super religious and doesn't believe in things like depression.

2022-11-15 12:41:16,depression,"Upset would be an understatement for how I feel on some days. When someone disrespects you, do you just take it, accept it and move on? Bottle up your initial feelings and pretend like nothing happened? Let the person who disrespected you know that they won, and you lost? 

FUCK no.

I’ll never forget those who disrespected me, wronged me, manipulated me. I’ll never forgive them for how they made me feel. I’ll never forget the stupid fucking smirks on their faces, as if though I was the one completely at fault and they shared no blame. The way they seemingly moved on without a care. 

FUCK YOU. You two-faced piece of hypocritical shit. You insincere lying motherfucker. That fucking smug look on your face like you’re above everyone. FUCK YOU. 

Life isn’t fair, and it doesn’t matter how you feel or what you’ve been through. We were meant to be pitted against each other in this viscous  cycle of life. A universe where the “strong” are awarded while the weak suffer. What the FUCK kind of world is this anyway? 

If the creator is indeed an all-good and loving God, then I can only say I’m truly sorry for not believing that he exists. Because everything I’ve experienced in my life has proven nothing towards the possibility that God cares. And that’s just the way it works. You can be nice, treat people well, do everything right and still get fucked. That’s not luck, that’s life. 

I AM sorry for the kind of hateful monster I’ve become. Because like everyone else, I was born happy and pure but learned evil through many traumatic experiences and lonely nights. 

Maybe it was all my fault all along. Maybe it wasn’t a product of my environment or circumstance. Maybe this was who I am as a person all along. And I’m scared to admit that I may be right.

Note:: I'm not good with explaining and words and English isn't my first language so I apologize in advance. 

My thoughts are so noisy that it sometimes affect my hearing, thinking, the outside or the world outside my head itself is the noisy one, being half aware that the noisy one is my brain, however in those situations, I will be thinking that the main cause of noises is the outside of my brain. 

It happened a lot, and just yesterday, my mind is so noisy, as if there is too much that I'm hearing or thinking? that I complained out loud to my best friend that its so noisy, and he responded with ""Girl, its quiet, what are you on about??""

What I am attempting to describe is a desire to make people dislike you, to make people mad so they last out at you as a sort of punishment for your actions. I often feel like I am being a negative person who is actively hurting others lives yet I am not getting punished like I should be. As a result I attempt to infuriate my friends or family so that I can receive the punishment I deserve. Regardless of how esoteric the concept of morally is it allows me to feel that morality is at least a functioning system that punishes those who are commiting evil acts. If I do it enough people may even avoid me depressing my mood further and allowing me to better commit to my suicidal ideology. I would like to reiterate I know this is hurting me and I don't actively try to do it, it's more something I do subconsciously.

2022-11-15 11:57:36,depression,"Hello Reddit. Hey to everyone else who has depression, I hope you guys are doing alright. Me, I'm doing awful. I don't want to be here anymore at all. I would possibly end my life if it wouldn't make my parents so upset, because they love me, for whatever reason, they do. I hate myself. I deserve to die, I deserve to burn in hell for the rest of eternity, if theoretically I'm not already, because that's what this life feels like to me. 

I want to be happy. I've tried so hard, and I don't believe in happiness. I feel like life is too stressful and depressing to every have a serene moment ever again, maybe for a few minutes when you have a dopamine rush, just a small reward. Those are the only feelings of safety I will ever feel. 

A few weeks ago I quit taking my SSRIs, I don't want to rely on medicine. I'm only 20 and I've been addicted to opiates, marijuana, alcohol, nicotine. They plague my existence. I feel as if they seriously gave me schizophrenia, or brain damage, because my mind has been severely altered, but they I wonder if that's just growing up and don't want to be a little cry baby, because there's a possibility everyone else in this world feels the same. I have really bad eye floaters, I can see them right now, It's like I have bugs always following me around, It's miserable. Went to many eye specialists, no fix. How can I be productive like this? How can I just live life and make my parents proud with this? And then on top of that I struggle with substance abuse mostly because of my issues, I struggle with chronic depression, anger, I feel psychotic, but nobody around me notices, I can hold it all in.

I was thinking of suicide before I made this post. I want to end it all, but I'm scared of nothingness, or even worse hell. And, I couldn't do that to my parents. They're such good people and I don't want to hurt them any more than I have. I was just a kid but I've said such hurtful things to them in the past :(

I want to live, I want to find a beautiful girl and make her happy for the rest of time, but I even struggle with that. I'm extremely over protective, maybe I'm just insecure, I mean I hate everything about myself, I usually just don't talk to people because I hate my personality, It's better if I just keep my mouth closed because I'll end up hurting someone's feelings on accident and then they'll come at me with bad blood.

I don't know what to do anymore. I have 3 alcohol related cases, I've been to jail 3 times and I'm only 20. I'm ruining my life, but I'm not trying to. I just want to do good, but my mind won't let me, they're not conscious decisions. I'm a bad person, but I'm trying, I'm trying my best but that always backfires on me and leaves me in a state of unescapable depression which leads to me getting blackout drunk, saying hurtful things to the only people who have ever cared about me, or going to jail.

I'll never be anything in life, but all I want is to make my family proud, have enough money to live the lifestyle that I want, and then eventually have a wife and a family, but damn man if I make it there without dying or going to jail I'll be shocked. :(

I'm just another human struggling, but it feels like my struggle has a magnitude of 10 million times the worst hell you could possibly imagine, and It's self inflicted. I'm not demeaning anyone, but I wish I could find someone who openly struggles like me, I would do everything in my power for us to figure out a way out, but it seems like nobody else does, or they just hide it and make an oath to themselves to never show it. I'm sure I'll end up deleting this out of embarassment, or to just try to forget about it and lie to myself, but for now, I hope somebody sees that I'm not a horrible human being because I promise I try, maybe just not hard enough, who knows we're all human, just humans..",Depression - Another soul lost in this cruel world

My mom basically let my grandmother raise me but now that I don’t have my grandmother I’ve felt like I really need my mom. I feel lonely and like I have no family at all to come check on me and call me. I’m scared, every day I keep feeling more like I don’t know how to do anything or navigate my life. My mom is usually pretty cold to me. One time she told me that I need to get weight loss surgery because I’ve gained a lot of weight and I told her I wanted to work out and try to lose weight. She was really unsupportive of me. When I started college in 2011 we had a huge fight and she told me that I was trying to be “better than her” and basically one up her for trying to go to school. I eventually fell to my depression and anxiety and dropped out of school. I have adhd and I have another disorder that makes math really impossible. I want to do better in my life but I feel like a disappointment to my family. None of them ever call me. No one ever checks to see if I’m alive.

I just fucking hate everything man.  I don't know how I have a girlfriend that's in good mental health and is all around just a beautiful person.  If she weren't here, I probably would have ended it already.  And talking with her about this stuff is useless, because what's she supposed to say?

2022-11-15 11:04:36,depression,"Ever since I turned 15 and puberty hit I slowly realized something extremely disgusting about myself. I was in fear of it being true. I was in denial of it for a solid year. Now I'm looking to somehow find a source for finasteride or similar medication to 'castrate' myself chemically by suppressing hormones.

This is because I am a pedophile. For a while I kept trying to 'force' myself into a normal sexual mold but absolutely nothing I could do was going to work. I thought it was POCD (an obsession with the idea you might be a pedophile). I wish I was still in that phase, but eventually I learned the truth.

This is due to the fact after a while, I gained a habit of using lolicon shit as an outlet to get off in the 'most ethical way possible' (nobody 'needs' any kind of porn in the first place, I was lying to myself because they weren't real) which led to multiple emotional breakdowns due to lack of impulse control. I'm sick of dealing with thoughts that shouldn't be. I feel like the only way I can continue going on in life without killing myself or cutting myself off socially to anyone that would trust me, is to abuse hair loss medication so I can break my hormones and kill off my sex drive.

It's honestly pathetic but my therapist barely even registers this as a problem and thinks that it's something I can just ignore as being 'unwanted intrusive thoughts' fuck no man I can't just shrug off this shit. I'm only 17 and it feels like my life is already over before it could start. I desperately wish you could just tell your psychiatrist, ""I have fucked up sexual preferences and I want to nullify any and all desire so I can continue living life productively and with less shame by taking medication"", but chemical castration is only an option if you've already hurt children.

2022-11-15 10:58:50,depression,"About 8 months ago my depression got pretty bad and I decided I wanted to kill myself, but before I did that I thought I'd ask my only long-term friend for sex since I'd be dead soon. She said no and I just said okay but I couldn't bring myself to end it that night. Then about 3 months after that I felt suicidal again and since I thought I was gonna die I'd have nothing to lose. So I asked again, basically begged and she said no with a thumbs-up emoji, and then she didn't block me but she hasn't responded to me in 5 months, and she still follows me on her private Instagram account but removed my follow so I can't see whats on it for some reason.

We had been pretty good friends since we were like 10 so it's only a matter of time before one of her parents asks why we don't speak anymore, and I know she'll answer truthfully and say what I did, she's always been the type of person to tell her mum the truth about stuff like this. The thing is my mum is still good friends with her parents (Saw them last week actually) and my brother is basically best friends with her brother since they play video games daily together so our families are very connected. And I know what her dad is like, he would definitely tell my mum what I said, he's a very brash person who doesn't mind exposing people.

I was going to apologize to her and ask her not to tell anyone the day after I did it, but I started by just saying ""hey"" which she never responded to so I didn't get the chance to say the apology then. And even then it's not like I meant it, I'm not actually sorry I just care about self-preservation. I'm a kinda weird asshole, (hell the thing I did to her is just the tip of the iceberg of my wrongdoings, it's just the one that puts me at jeopardy the most) I just don't want certain people in my life to know that I am. I don't think apologizing now would even help anything, if she even reads it at all. 

I literally cannot take embarrassment, it's like my kryptonite, especially about sexual stuff. I hate my mum knowing anything about me beyond what I let her know and this would probably completely change the image I give her. I've never been scared of death and although I'd prefer to be alive I wouldn't mind killing myself to avoid this inevitable situation. It would suck since my life's finally starting to improve since I got a potential new job and stuff, and I would say I'm not suicidal and I want to live, but I wouldn't mind just being dead to avoid this so yeah

I wouldn't just be embarrassed, I'd be embarrassed and exposed to my mum. She currently thinks of me as pretty innocent and a good person who hasn't done anything wrong in years. Which couldn't be further from the truth. Once the facade is gone I have to live with her, look her in the eye, eat meals cooked by her. I wouldn't care at all If I could just move out. But I can't.

And I've never feared death, I never looked at it particularly fondly nor particularly poorly. the eternal void of nothingness doesn't have any problems, any challenges, which doesn't sound too bad. I'd much prefer to be alive, but only in the very specific way I envision.

I don't know why I'm alone, or why I'm alone. I'm not that unnatractive. I'd say I'm average, with a certain charm, but I might be mentally fucked in countless ways. I can't interact, I can't love. I have constant ideas in my mind and create problems where I don't know if there any or not. I don't know if I feel, or if I just convinced myself when that I am when I am. I'm constantly stressed over my image, and how others perceive me. I can't just calm down and connect. I'm desperate. But at the same time I recognize it, and I've been hurt in the past. I don't let anyone use me, I don't let my desperation take the best of me, I don't act stupid. Most of the time I'm tense, and confused as fuck. I don't know what to do. I wonder about other people's intentions with me. I make up shit in my head. Start reading them without trying and don't even know if my accessments are right or not. Im in constant doubt and anxiety. 

I've been beaten up by multiple dudes at once, I've fought multiple dudes at once and escaped to protect a friend, I'm no pussy, but I wouldn't say I'm an ""alfa"" or whatever. Most of my fights happened because some douche was trying to take advantage of me, or steal from me or whatever. 

I think women see me as a bully because I have certain reactions but I only have them because I'm traumatized and they are defense mechanisms. I never act uppon them but I'm pretty bad at disguising my thoughts and they perceive them. Idk why they would think that of me, I would say it's obvious that I'm just hurt and traumatized, and kinda fucked in the head. But I'm a good person. I studied inter-personal relationships a lot in my alone time, and care a lot about right and wrong. I would never do anything to hurt anyone on purpose and am constantly fighting my demons and bad thoughts, but I wouldn't allow others to step on me either. It kinda makes me paranoid that other's are trying to step on me or that they will do it by instinct without actually being actively trying it, so a lot of the time I'm way too defensive. 

Im doing school at night right now. There's this girl that talked to me on the second day of school to ask for information about the schedule. She invited me once to walk home with a small group with 2 other girls and a boy, all in my class. She will usually say something, or just greet me, or volunteer to help me whenever I need something in class. Just be generally attemptive. Last time she offered to borrow me a calculatior for the Physics exam when the teacher brought it up and I said I didn't have one (I'm broke as shit and basically live with help from the state) But she never actually tries to talk to me and I'm not willing to give in and make conversation first because of how stepped on I was in the past. She tested me (or at least that's how I perceived it) once in the train when we were all going home, by touching me and trying to see how I would react and see if I'm awkward and such. I don't lose my spaghetti over that type of stuff, I like female touch, it feels good, but I'm calm over it and just kept answering whatever she asked me. As I said I've kissed in the past. I might act like a weirdo and stuff but it's over much more complex stuff. I think they just saw me as a sexual predator type virgin, then after that situation because I was just so calm and normal over something like that they started seeing me as a ""player-type who's silent to try to be edgy"" or something like that. (As I said, I can't stop thinking about how others perceive me) 

The vibe between me and her always ends weird af because I think she doesn't understand why I can't bring myself to talk to anyone. I also have constant fucking ticks from me trying to hide my thoughts and emotions. The other people also don't try to talk to me, I guess they just expect me to do it first, idk why. 

Every conversation I have ends up feeling weird, and tense and awkward and I'm sure everyone thinks I'm a weirdo and a bad person that tries to put others down, I'm almost sure that's how I come off even though it's not the case.

Idk what yall will think of this post, I'm sure I sound like a 14yr old edgelord but holy fuck I swear if it isnt true. I'm being honest to my heart. I'm fucked. Im trying so hard. I'm so depressed over being alone that a lot of times I'll just stay sleeping a whole day, not wanting to get out to do what I have to do, or face the world and leave home.

The effect was good and then I was off it for a long time, managing my moods with mainly lifestyle changes.

I have extreme episodes alot of times and I'm on medications too so I already do have a psychiatrist. I get flashbacks of my traumas. Now the real problem is there are some things I'm uncomfortable with that my boyfriend doesn't understand and tells me that I'm over exaggerating. So my electricity went out and it was only mine in the middle of the night, luckily my uncle lives near and he tried to fix it up but it just didn't work. There is one thing I hate is that I hate strangers getting into my house especially with me and my two cockatiels being home because I live in a pretty closed off area  where everyone is horrible. I really hate depending on my family members because they are really cruel and disgusting and not one to depend on so I'm pretty much alone through everything. I thought I could lean on my boyfriend and go over to his house with my two cockatiels but he told me he is so exhausted because of me and my problems. And I understand that but that doesn't change the fact that I'm struggling over here too trying to live a stupid life I don't even want to live through. He doesn't understand that when something is uncomfortable for me there isn't another way around it. I hate going over to family members houses because I trust no one and I pretty much have extreme trust issues with every single relatives. And now we are having a fight (with my boyfriend) and he is telling me what are you? A queen?

I hate social media so I try my best to stay away and getting on reddit was my last resort because I'm so desperate for the help I'm not even getting. Am I wrong? Am I the one overreacting? Am I wrong to be uncomfortable and wanting to go with something that's more comfortable for me even if it means spending 5 hours through it? I feel so suicidal.

2022-11-14 16:12:47,depression,"Stupid brain. I am prone to fixations on certain topics. I have them, they last a while (usually a day) and I forget and move on. I have wanted to be a novelist and I recently met a girl who is very into me. She inspired me to write. I get like this sometimes, but I almost never finish anything more than a couple pages at best.

Apparently I have been talking about it far too much because I realized today that she didn't want to talk about it anymore. I asked her to just tell me when I am beating a dead horse instead of letting me drone on. I can handle ""tone it down"" better than ""I am checked out enough that I can't even pretend to be interested"". It was obvious for me to get the vibe which means she checked out a while ago. Which sucks because I know she doesn't realize that she just threw a bucket of cold water on my fixation but it doesn't seem to be coming back and I will probably lose interest completely by morning. I got four pages - double the usual so I guess part on the back. It was fun while it lasted.

I am so tired of my Creativity being this fragile. It appears, cracks and disappears. What is the point of it appearing in the first place if not to torment me? I just want to finish something but I can't keep my heart on a project.",Weak Creativity

2022-11-14 15:37:18,depression,"I know the last thing a depressed person wants to hear is “it gets better.” I understand. It doesn’t help, in fact it makes you feel bloody worse. But let me tell you.
You have the option to feel and be better. 
I have struggled with crippling depression this year, I was suicidal and felt like my life was a complete disaster. Nothing seemed to go my way. It was brutal. Now as I’ve recovered from my depression I can look back in hindsight and see how bloody incredible it was to fully experience the hell of depression. It taught me so many lessons about myself and my life that I wouldn’t of experienced even if I was a happy healthy person. Depression is like the ‘two wolves’ metaphor. Which wolf wins? The one you feed. I learnt that depression thrives off you feeding it. When you feed the negativity it grows stronger, just as you feed the wolf more meat it grows bigger and better. It’s the same with depression. Take notice of how much you’re feeding it and how much it grows in response. Nothing can exist unless you feed it ;) 
I was also on SSRI’s for 5 months. I personally felt I could completely destroy my depression being off them. I recommend to get off them. They give you ‘fake’ serotonin. Hope this helps! 
YOU’RE AMAZING AND STRONG!",My depression was a blessing in disguise

It pains me to know that my best friend is gone from this world and I feel so empty inside. She knew all my secrets and always gave me the best advice to be the good man I am today. I am now 32 years old (male) and haven't been married, but I have had over 20+ ex-girlfriends in my lifetime. I have been adjusting to living on my own, making enough money just to get by, but secretly inside, I feel as if I'm dying from the pain. My job is also causing me mental stress due to a micromanaging boss whom has made me fear making any decision at all and will not allow me to move up the company latter. I've worked there for 10 years, and new workers get 1.50 less than me as their supervisor. I feel like I can't do it anymore. I just want to sleep and never wake up sometimes. My family doesn't know any of this because I portray myself to be a positive person with a fake smile, always telling them the lie that I'm alright, but secretly, I'm just tired of it all. I do the same things every day after work and have no happiness from it. I always told myself that I would never live a robotic lifestyle,  but here I am grinding away towards what I feel as a pointless life with no family of my own or happiness. Zero friends, siblings that lie, boss that's overbearing, throw away job and no enjoyment. Oh, and I just lost my animal 2 months ago as well.

2022-11-14 15:21:18,depression,"I read something today that resonated with me and changed my perspective on the saying “everything happens for a reason.” Generally, at least for me, I took the saying whenever I’d hear it as people stating that something bad happens for a good reason. For example, you got fired from that job but for a good reason! But no, that’s not the truth. The truth is that good things can happen for bad reasons too, good things can happen for good reasons, bad things can happen for good reasons, and bad things can happen for bad reasons! In this life, there is truly no black and white reason, meaning, or reasoning for an action, consequence, or behavior. Everything is just random I truly believe. Life is but a statistic that is alive hit the odds on experiencing. And within this life, we are subjugated to random chaos by random chance happening in the universe. I hate life so much man. Someone today also posted somewhere saying that they thought humans were never meant to critically think and be aware. That we just so happened to evolve to the point of being aware of our existence. I don’t believe we were never meant or meant to do or be anything but man self awareness and possessing the capacity for existential thought is a curse in my eyes. I want ignorant bliss so bad.","Everything Happens for a Reason, Whether Good or Bad. Sometimes, Even Good Things Happen for a Bad Reason."

I know he sh himself because he tells me, but I have done as much as I can without running our friendship. He has a pretty bad relationship with his parents and telling them wouldn't make a difference since they found out before, and nothing changed. He's had a couple of therapist but they don't last long. He also finds that it doesn't help since they are obligated to tell someone if they are harming themselves. He also has meds but he's not taking them regularly because they make him nauseous, he told me his mom would get mad if he asked to change them again. I tried convincing him to start taking regularly and he just kept saying they make him nauseous.

He has a long distance boyfriend that is helping him stay alive, but things don't seem to be going so good. His boyfriend openly admitted that he likes someone else but still loves him and my friend won't break up with him. He told me a couple days ago that if they break up he will kill him self. I didn't know it was this bad and I have no clue what to do since it seems to be getting worse. I didn't know he wanted to die so badly till a while ago when he also told me in a joking way how embarrassing it was that he failed to kill himself so many times.

2022-11-14 15:16:26,depression,"Everytime I look at my screen to do my schoolwork my mind just goes blank. It’s been like this for the past few weeks for some reason. I feel like my mind has been deteriorating as the days move forward.

My whole life I lived a life of being mistreated. Little stuff, big stuff, I was always being hurt in some way all the way up until 4 months ago when my dad finally took me away from my mom.

I’m expected to do better but I just feel worse. It’s so hard to do anything. Every little thing is bothering me and it’s getting harder to do anything because I keep blanking out/daydreaming and stuff. I just feel so sad. 

I can’t control my thoughts at all. I just can’t. It’s like another brain is in my head because even though I know everything it feels like it doesn’t matter. It’s like there’s two me’s.

My dads taking me to a doctor soon and it’s so hard to talk to them about my mental issues because I feel like they’re gonna take it and bring it up later against me or something like that. Ik that’s not what they mean but I can’t help but feel that way. Every little thing feels like a personal attack..

What’s worse is that he couldn’t get an appointment this week and this week is when my stepmom is gonna check my grades to see if I did my schoolwork and I just can’t do it. 

I don’t wanna tell her because she might think i’m crazy or that i’m just trying to conjure up an excuse so I don’t have to do my homework. Ik it’s not true but my thoughts are too overwhelming to control. I just can’t handle it anymore.

And I have to mention a specific class. I don’t wanna do that stupid orchestra class. I put myself in there but it’s too much for me. I’m trapped. I genuinely would rather die than go to that class again. I’m so sad. 

It’s so much and it’s so stupid. I tried pouring boiling water on my hand so I wouldn’t have to go into class but my hand wouldn’t let me so I ended up with just first degree burns. 

I hate this so bad. If I don’t do my schoolwork they might take my tablet and phone and I really don’t want that but there’s something wrong with me I can’t do this I can’t I really can’t I want to but I can’t. 

It’s too much for me. My mind races a million miles per minute at nighttime and i’m almost brain dead during the day.

I’m sorry I just need help figuring out how to finish all my homework in time. I can’t but I have to .

I know I shouldn’t be broadcasting my feelings to everyone online but it’s hard when I have no one. If I tell my therapist that I wanna off myself or something like this i’m afraid she’ll send me to the mental ward and that’s the last place I wanna go. If I get sent there I’m really gonna off myself. I promise. The stories I heard, everything, I really really really don’t wanna go there. They don’t treat people right over there.

my brain is so fried rn. just writing everything i’m thinking. i've made a lot of mistakes. i've done people in my life wrong. a lot of the time, i'm too stubborn to admit it too. i tell myself i'm trying to fix myself, but now i don't know if i'm truly trying at all or even doing enough. but surely no one should believe that they're better off dying, right? i told myself many times, it could be worse because i didn’t want to be that girl. i could have no food. no clothes. no bed. but hell i've been googling ways to commit. and that's not right, im smart enough to know that. no one can tell how miserable i am on the inside because i behave. i'm a good kid, i think. i'm 20 yo and in college, 3rd year, im actually going to graduate a semester early. i have a good gpa. my plan is to go to PA school. not because its my dream or because i want to. but because that's what happens after college. you need a career. i'm fairly decent at science. if im not i'll just work for it a little. so i'm simply getting my career. as bad as this sounds, i view it as one more step/milestone closer to death. this weekend, when i told my mom that i'm depressed and have been for a while, she countered with ""there's a roof over your head, food on the table, your college is being paid for"". now i’m thinking have i just been an ungrateful piece of shit the whole time? i don't know anything anymore.  if someone were to ask me what's wrong, i'd have no clue where to start. is there anything truly wrong? did i screw myself up? when did i screw myself up? i remember when i was as young as 6 or 7, my parents would fight, yell, scream. my dad would hit my mom. as i grew up it happened less behind closed doors. i started to see it all. the bruises. the blood. the broken stuff. my dad hates my mom. told me i was just like her. a liar. manipulative. (funny enough i think i became manipulative and a liar) i don't think my mom was either one of those. im sorry for my mom and dad. i'm sad their lives are like that. i slowly became afraid of anything related to him. his footsteps. his voice. his presence. my heart would beat out my chest  and i would sweat like crazy when he checked too see if i was asleep at night. hes threatened me but only hit me a couple of times. but i was scared of him (i think this is the first time i've ever admitted it. wanted to be brave but i’m just not). i begged my mom to leave him but she never did. then a couple years later he stopped hitting my mom, i was around 15 or 16. but the fighting never stopped and still hasn't. every day every month of the year. and every time they fight, i am put in the middle. i feel so empty inside. i can't remember my childhood. i didn't enjoy life. whats there to enjoy. i don't know who i am. i don't have a soul. i only made a couple friends throughout my life. when i made a mistake that made me lose the friends i had, i stopped making friends. i feel like i don't deserve them and i'm learning to be okay with being alone. my thoughts are only filled with ""how can i get closer to death"". i started getting nightmares about my dad again. which kills me. i mean come on, my own dad. i asked my mom yesterday ""when will it stop"" she said ""never"" and i asked ""is this how i'm supposed to live"" and she said ""yes"". i started self harming again. on the outside, nothing seems to be going downhill. i get up everyday. get ready for class. get the grades. i won't just stop and drop everything in my life. people have expectations of me. but on the inside i just feel so bad. worse than bad. i tried therapy, it didn't  work. i feel like ending myself everyday. i’ve even got a goddamn plan. which i’m sitting in front of right now. and i feel that one of these days it'll happen. maybe not tomorrow ( or maybe) or even a month from now, but i'll be gone too soon. one of these times i'll do it . i can't stay for a dad who doesn't love me, a mom who doesn't care, a brother who prefers i stay away from him, and friends i don't have. if i had an autobiography, unfortunately, this is all i can put. if there was a fleeting moment where i felt good, laughed, or smiled, then its all tainted. it all seems superficial compared to everything that i find big and bad in my life. maybe this was dramatic. you can see how unsure i am of my own thoughts. i question everything. i know i’m going crazy like i’m just losing it. thought this would help. it didn’t. my bad thoughts are consuming me. have no idea what i just wrote. fuck life. the end.",god please take me i’m so tired.
2022-11-14 15:00:20,depression,"I hope this helps someone out there that suffers from depression... Dont ever make the mistake I made today because I feel completely broken. I suffer from depression &amp; bi polar disorder. I have pretty extreme highs and lows at times. This morning was my son's baptism. My wife &amp; children attended but I stayed home. I've been thru a lot in my life and didn't always believe but as an adult God has been a huge part of my life. I believe strongly that my life has been effected positively by God many times. Theres no other way someone like me could have the blessings I have without God. I'm lazy, easily triggered, have anger issues, verbally abusive and depressed. Add bipolar to that mess. The only credit I can give myself sadly, is that I'm not physically abusive. Today was my biggest regret &amp; I'll have to live with it forever. I'll never forgive myself. I've said and done a lot of things that brought me to tears with regret but this is beyond that. Crying doesnt eas the pain..it kills me inside to know my baby son, that I love more than anything in the world was baptized...a huge moment in his life, without his Dad by his side. I left my wife to stand alone. It's wrong on so many levels and there is no excuse for it. I made pointless excuses this morning, probably to make myself feel better for not going but I knew I was wrong. How could I do this to my wife and baby boy?? The only thing I have is my family. My parents both passed, my grandparents as well. I'm not close with Aunts &amp; Uncles. The only people that keep me on this earth and give me the happiness that I get from life, I let down. I've never missed anything before today. Bday parties, babtisms, school plays, baseball games. I was always there to support my kids regardless of how I felt because I knew not going was unacceptable. Today I let depression win and ruin something I was so proud of, always being there.. on a day that meant so much. Especially being someone that truly believes God has given me far more than I deserve. I'm writing this because I don't know what else to do. Right before I made this account I was crying as hard as I ever have &amp; the pain was unbearable. He's the cutest little guy in the world I'm talking ridiculously unfair levels of cuteness. Everywhere we go people say how adorable he is. It melts my heart to know he's my son and I'm more thankful than words can express. Today I failed him as a father. I failed God after never giving up on me, my entire life. I failed my wife &amp; I failed myself. On all levels I failed. Not to mention my in-laws must have been so upset &amp; dissapointed. There's nothing I can do or say to get this day back. I wish so much that I could change it and be there for my family. If you ever feel like you can't go to an event as important as this for your children..get up and go anyway. Do it for them. If you have to drag yourself there, do it. You only get 1 life. Don't miss the important moments. You will regret it forever. God please forgive me for not being there today. Be with my son always, in his heart &amp; protect him. To anyone reading this thank you for taking the time &amp; God bless. If you could say a prayer for me that would mean a lot. Love you all.
Thank you for reading",I missed my sons baptism &amp; don't know what to do

When I talked about my social struggles in high school, everyone told me that things will get a lot better in college. They told me that you will find it much easier to make friends and to get invited to parties or whatever.

When I entered college, I know for a fact that one of my biggest goals is to turn my social life around. From day one, I put myself out there and tried to meet as many people as possible and to join in clubs. However, in the end, all the happened was that I got rejected and ignored non-stop.

2022-11-14 14:23:14,depression,"There's a constant challenge of getting enough to be comfortable with someone. Unfortunately people I meet whether online or offline have this almost general personality for each gender. I have more trouble making friends with men than with women, but the women that I do end up speaking to don't last very long most of the time.

The men that I find online tend to end up being the ones interested in guys so I either immediately get sexual advances or they take their time through conversation which I'm not interested in doing at all. It's already very difficult for me to relate with men and this only makes it more discouraging. Women are a hit or miss and can be an equally annoying experience due to sudden ghosting or whatever else reason even though the conversation felt like it went well.

I don't like the holidays. I don't like seeing people going back to their families and enjoying to spend it with one or more people. I've cut contact with my family due to the highly toxic environment and haven't seen or spoken to them in many years. Bridges with so-called friends have been burned -- for good reason -- since they were not the people whom I thought they were. At the moment I don't really have anyone I can connect with on any level and it's very difficult to handle at times.

It's been so many years of finding someone to be friends with, someone I can truly call a friend and it's too much of a fucking challenge in life. It's very exhausting. Why is it so damn hard to meet a damn friend?",Holidays are coming up -- realizing more and more that I'm alone and lonely.

I can’t break out of the pattern of ending bad habits and restarting them again when I step away from her…

2022-11-14 14:19:11,depression,"I’m not exactly sure if anyone will read this but I’ve struggled with drug addiction for the last 7 years, I am currently 26 years old. To make things short I have been to multiple rehabs and overdosed over 15 times, once being pronounced clinically dead. No, I am not looking for sympathy, but this is just my background and I wanted to maybe give you a jest of how emotionally unstable I am. Anyways, I am currently sober thanks to a woman who changed my life. However, we recently had an engagement end and quite frankly I’m fucking crushed but I keep it moving. Even though she made me happy I still hid my depression from her and all my loved ones. Simply don’t want anyone to worry about me, they have their own lives to live and I refuse to get in the way of that. I actually slit my wrists for the first time over the summer, something I never understood until I did it. It gave me relief, like I deserved this pain for being the fucking piece of shit I am. It gave me relief. Anyways, I’m in a very dark place, so dark I’ve come to Reddit to remain anonymous. This I where things take a dark turn. I’ve been planning my suicide. Yes I know, the most selfish thing I could do, but when every waking minute on this earth is a living fucking hell, it seems like the perfect solution, the only solution. After many years of failures, relapsing, and isolation, I’ve just had enough. I ask myself, “ why am I here, what purpose do I serve?”. I always come back with the same answer, nothing. You can’t tell anybody you want to die because they’ll just throw me back in the psych ward and I hate it there. If there is a god I only ask to just let me fucking happy, I don’t care if I’m homeless living on the streets. I’d pick happiness over anything.

2022-11-14 14:02:01,depression,"Context. We're an Indian family. My parents have ruined my dreams and forced their dreams on me. We used to fight a lot when I was young, when I felt like I can still make a change in my life. 

Now I've given up. I'm in the US struggling with my masters, trying to fulfill my parent's dream. My parents are very happy with me right now but I'm miserable and scared inside. I've removed my friends, family and family friends from my life because I don't trust anyone to be able to help me. Yes I do therapy and have a psychiatrist, but I've lost faith. I can't even get too deep into the treatment because I feeling guilty about the cost. 

My mother has anxiety. She never told me but I know it. She vaguely told me about 'visiting a doctor because I make her stressed' and I saw her medication for anxiety. Why does she not tell me about it? Because we're Indian. On top of that, she actually had ovarian cysts, due to which she had surgery to remove them. That has taken a toll on her health and she must think that her anxiety is justified because of her physical well being. 

My parents used to mock my tears when I was a kid. Fyi, I used to cry after coming back from school every single day. I used to sit in my room and cry randomly because i understood that I have no interest in what my parents are forcing me to achieve and that is going to ruin my life someday. For 10 years, it was a routine to sit in my room and cry intermittently for 4-5 hours while simultaneously doing my work. I don't know, but that doesn't feel normal to me. But I never got help, I couldn't. Mental health isn't a thing in India, especially my family. My mother even told me, ""why do you cry like this? If you continue, do you know you might become depressed and end up in a psycho hospital""? She found out 3 times accidentally my self harm marks, and scolded me. Told me I was ungrateful and that she couldn't tell my father this cause this would hurt him so much. 

By the way, my parents and I have a very loving relationship now. Distance has played a major role. Or I don't know, their attitude towards be has changed. They are not as harsh with me. They encourage me to sometimes draw, go out, sing, buy things for myself, anything that makes me happy: a start contrast from my childhood. I think to some extent they have noticed the effect the childhood has had on me and they are trying to go easy on me now. 

I love my parents. I recognize that even though they've forced their dreams on me, they've only done it because they thought that would be the best for me. They only wanted me to have money and security and therefore forced me in the direction they thought would help me. And they have worked incredibly hard for me. This is where my guilt kicks in. They have worked so hard for me, why am I so depressed? Why can't I just give them what I want happily? Why can't my brain just stop being miserable? 

But nothing can stop me now from functioning less and less like a person while pretending to be alright over my 3 minutes call with my parents everyday. I've been dreaming about dying peacefully. I've been thinking ways of offing myself but my biggest regret will be if I leave my parents behind with this. After all their hard work, I don't want to do this to them. I want to die, but I don't want to do it while my parents are alive. It's going to ruin them. 

I'm scared to tell my parents I'm depressed. 
1. What if they think I'm ungrateful. 
2. What if they think it's their fault? I don't want that. I'm not trying to punish them. I'm just trying to come clean. This is affecting my ability to look for jobs because the moment I open my resume the idea of being judged again becomes so scary that I push it off.
3. What if this affects my parents health? What if my mother gets sick from worry? She's been a physically weak person lately, and I'm scared that if I tell her anything..","My mother has anxiety. Should I tell her about my anxiety, depression and suicidal thoughts?"

2022-11-14 13:56:25,depression,"To make a long story short, I’ve struggled with depression on and off ever since puberty. After a stint in a mental health hospital last year, I thought I had turned my life around and that I’d never have to feel this way again. I couldn’t be more wrong.

I’ve been depressed for quite a few months now but managing it, until 3 days ago when an incident at work completely destroyed me and my confidence. I spent the entire day in bed today and crying through the day, and the thought of going into work tomorrow is sending me into panic attacks. I used to think I had to fight it, that it was my duty to myself to live a full life, but I just…don’t see a point anymore. I’m always going to be depressed. I’m on antidepressants and it only treats my anxiety, it has never affected my depression ever. 

I have no desire to kill myself right now, my relationship with my fiancé is probably the only reason why I want to live. But I’m just so broken. I’m so exhausted and I’m so tired of fighting everyday just to be a productive member of society. 

I’ve always hated myself, but my negative thoughts have taken over and I don’t see a reason to get out of bed. I’m better off just staying in my room all day and never leaving.

23yo male, just made this account and this is my first post, just need to put out my thoughts to see what other people think. its gonna look like word vomit. i dont write or type my thoughts ever really so bear with me

been going through another depressive episode. These tend to happen multiple times a year lasting for weeks and sometimes months at a time. these episodes usually involve extreme self-loathing severe anxiety and no energy

the current one im in has been going for about 6 weeks now. 0 motivation or drive afraid to leave my self-made prison (my room) afraid to face the world or even get something as simple as getting sustenance or being on top of my hygiene. always hungry, always self-loathing, always petrified of the thought of talking to my roommates or just being in their presence seemingly due to the guilt of trapping myself in my room and i don't leave my room due to THAT, like an endless cycle

that's just my home life anything outside of that feels bigger and worse, struggling to find a job the social anxiety gets in the way hardcore like a never-ending hill climb and I'm already fatigued after the first step

these are just a few things i had on my mind there are many other factors I'm aware of and should have probably mentioned like for 1 example the girlfriend i had the last few years trying to commit die last winter and that whole deal has taken quite a toll on me for sure but i know there are deeper more underlining issues that have been with me since i was much younger and since that episode these thoughts and feelings have spiked ... but as of now my head space is really spacy due to not eating so it hard to string thoughts in a way thats easy for anyone understand

just needed some of this off my chest for now but yea generally feeling stuck and i cant really see the light at the end of the tunnel (FYI NOT suicidal)

One year ago today I was kicked out, 16 at the time. 2020 my dad passed and I was in a dark place. I got a job at a restaurant, and after that I had to set up a bank account... so I set one up with my mom, turns out I had been getting money from my dads will that they (mom and stepdad) didn't tell me about. We had this huge ass fight.

She took me to work after that but never picked me up, they changed the locks and threw everything out on a cold ass rainy day. They said since I was getting his will that I could provide for myself. After I was sleeping in a tent in the woods barely eating. Just going to work, then to my tent...  just existing yk😂. 

I ended up dropping out to work, I would work my ass off working like 50 hour weeks every week. Couch hopping everywhere. Until my older brother moved back in town and we got a house, I've got 2 jobs now both as a cook, and had to work my ass off to buy a car.

2022-11-14 13:13:34,depression,"I hardly do anything productive because I avoid things I find difficult. But I find everything difficult! Last week I skipped my math class entirely because I was ashamed of my already bad grade, which will probably be worse since there’s an exam within 12 hours (and I haven’t studied, great). I just can’t find the motivation to care. In my head I have goals and dreams, but when I do nothing to achieve them I *maybe* feel guilty for a few minutes before slacking off again. Last week I cleaned my room, and though it was just a little, it took all day, and I had to take breaks too. 

Sometimes I feel aware of the passed time I’ve wasted, realizing I’m in the same place as I was last year. And the year before. And before. But I can’t get myself to take action. It’s like I’m actively stopping myself from being happy. 

I need help but I just don’t know how to explain this to my family. Latino families, or at least mine, seem to dismiss mental illness or were never educated on them properly. They know I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression since 2020, but I guess they think it just went away. I remember the look my mom gave me when the psychologist called and told her I was depressed. She obviously cared, her expression will probably haunt me until the end. But now she treats me normally, maybe a bit frustrated with my lack of activity. 

So is that how my family has always seen me? As just lazy, quiet, moody? But subconsciously they know better. They always tell me, “Maril what happened? You used to be so energetic and spunky when you were little! Where did it all go?” As if they don’t know. Maybe because my traumatic event happened when I was a preteen, they might’ve thought it was just my personality after puberty? I don’t know. I think maybe it’s a taboo subject to them, but it would really mean a lot of they could talk with me. I could be the one to reach out, but I’m afraid, so I’ll probably avoid it like everything else.

I meant to go the counseling center at my college, it’s free so I should really take advantage of their services. But I always find myself walking past the building each time, convincing myself I’ll go tomorrow. I feel pathetic avoiding something that’s meant to help. Realistically it’s easy, I don’t even need to make an appointment, yet I find it too difficult.

I have never wanted to die. In fact, I fear death and pain, I only ever wanted to be happy again. So why do I do this to myself? 

This has been a rant, written by someone who wants to get better yet does nothing to do so. After this I’ll probably cry for a bit before I distract myself with my phone again. I could try sending an email to the school counselors, but my hundreds of unopened emails tell me that’s not likely.",I never do anything

2022-11-14 12:51:09,depression,"I have struggled with depression my entire life (I’m 34F), never suicidal but I will withdraw and lose all motivation. I often start new projects and fail to complete them, hyper clean my house once a week but get overwhelmed with simple tasks like putting the dish I just used into the dishwasher on all the other days, become short fused. Etc etc.

Since having kids this has become a lot more difficult to manage and has put quite a strain on my marriage. The worst part is that I struggle with the idea of “getting better” I don’t want to get better. I want to stay in my dark pit, but with two kids (5 and 2) I can’t do that. And I find myself desiring the freedom to sulk in my darkness over the freedom of losing the darkness.

I've been bottling up since about July. I have felt a wedge between my husband and I for a while. He doesnt seem interested in intimacy with me. And I for the most part don't feel in the right mind for it. Our washer broke and the stress from that has flooded into our home. I've been struggling to keep house. But I'm trying. It's been overwhelming since we have to take things to the Laundromat. It doesn't help that we can't spend too much either since my husband INSISTED on purchasing a brand new vehicle (that I didn't even want)for me and so we are tight on funds until we refinance or pay it off. 
I started school and got a job cause I figured that I should help. I am able bodied and willing. But sadly that's put contention between us because who's going to take care of the house. He keeps saying he wants to help but I can't help but feel if he has to he resents it. I'm starting to lose it. I'm between wanting to throw my hands up and refuse to just disappearing from existence. I feel like I'm ruining everything. Either it's me Complicating things or I'm spending too much money. (Groceries are getting more expensive. He prefers I just buy less. If that were possible I would.) I have had it on one hand and I am just angry, because I'm doing the best I can, and doing things his way with a smile because I just want peace. I can't even have that. It's always something new I'm doing wrong. Some spot where I'm falling short. I feel like a piece of crap mom and person. At this point, I just want to disappear. The only people keeping me here are our kids. I can't traumatize them like that and I refuse. 
That doesn't mean I don't feel the void calling. I am scared to become a shell of a person again. I just started regaining my sense of self. I don't want to lose it again.","Trying not to fall into the Abyss, but it's calling."

I’ve been going through depression for a long while now and just days ago the person I love most said goodbye to me for the last time. We’d been on and off and after I moved back home we stopped talking for awhile. We got back in touch and she was struggling so I tried to support her. For reasons I won’t state I called the police to do a wellness check on her. She had some choice words for me afterwards but apologized the day after but also said that what I did was wrong and wished me well. She wasn’t the first person I fell for and who hurt me. I had to move home because of my sister’s pettiness. I have one friend left and no job. I didn’t take school seriously enough and although I graduated I doubt I’ll be able to go to college. I’m a burden to everyone it feels like and although I’m trying to be better I just get pushed back down some how.

2022-11-14 12:07:21,depression,"Hi all, first, obligatory announcement for being in mobile and possibly having formatting issues...

I (23F) am in grad school and highly underestimated the toll it would take on my mental health. I've been diagnosed (years ago) with plain ol' depression but am starting to think I might have PMDD.

I see a therapist and psychiatrist. I've been taking my meds, and they used to work, but not so much anymore. I feel like I'm at the point where I probably could use a higher level of care.

I have no active plans to kill myself, but the passive thoughts are there. I've started self harming again though. But I feel like a fraud because I'm able to enjoy life at times, but man when I get bad... I get baaaad.

Ever since middle/high school I was a perfectionist and studious individual. I was forced into an IOP program at one point, but since then have always just done therapy.

I tell myself I don't have the time to remove myself from all my obligations. I realize I am lucky in that I live at home and do technically have time and luxury of being able to slack on some obligations and be secure. But I can't let myself leave mid-semester of grad school and my part time job at a small company for days/weeks/months. Plus, I would know how to go about leaving both for a unknown amount of time. Also also, my job is an extremely small company so ADA doesn't apply to them (they're good people and do care about me, but at the end of the day, the show must go on).

Part of my depression these days comes from me feeling stuck. I want to be done with school and find my career (using my mistake of a degree) and move out and get engaged to my wonderful boyfriend. I utterly despise feeling stagnant and can't bring myself to delay it anymore because I should tAkE cArE oF mYsElF (the depression eventually comes back anyway so is there even a point?).

I see all my excuses and do understand the importance of taking care of myself. But I feel exhausted for constantly having to deal with my ever evolving mental health issues for over a decade. I also feel like I'm slowly giving up...

If i can't handle life now, how will I do when I have more life on my plate? Sorry, I just needed to rant. Maybe so advice? I don't even know anymore",I probably need more help but tell myself I don't have the time.

2022-11-13 16:39:10,depression,"Two straight years of the preferably final chapter of my life has brought me a generous amount of mental anguish and dread, and it ground me down to my fundamentals to a level that the truth has finally revealed itself, and I understand how it works now.

I deserve every ounce of every form of pain I have and continue to experience as a result of my shortcomings, failures, and wrongdoings.

Karma doesn't exist, but poetry does. Here's the poetic nature of my long-term destruction. I've found myself in a position where I'm to the point of slamming my head into walls and beating myself in the stomach with a baton, because of an incapability of art that I'm unable to faze.

Which was made several times worse when I discovered an individual in 2020 who, obscenely long story short, can be described as a version of me who didn't fail. Someone with a level of similar ideas and traits it's disturbing.

This is the important part. I was severely toxic in my comeuppance, and not only would I do the obnoxious and hurtful actions you would expect of a self absorbed crock of shit, but I also remember harassing actively developing artists for my own enjoyment.

And in the end, I get it now. I deserve this. Because of my foul treatment towards people who were just aspiring and following their passion.

Of course in the end, it was rooted from an internal jealousy that I was never equivalent to them as a person, neither in worth nor capability of beauty. I'm less valuable than unsustainable dirt, and that's exactly the place I should die and rot within.

As a result of letting every drop of my toxic core seep out and affect the unfortunate souls I came across, the world has sealed me righteously so, so I would molder from the inside out just like I always should have.

I slammed my head into a wall hard enough to see flashes in my vision last night, and I'm going to keep doing it. There's a reason it felt so right when the behavior started. This is what I'm supposed to feel for my mistakes and errors. I don't want anything to get better anymore.

To remember when I made the futile attempts to get the ball rolling with drawing is something that fills me with utmost hatred and disgust, after the things I did and the discovery of the version of me who didn't fail. As if I was meant for anything of the sort.

My desperate push for the pathetic idea of salvaging any significance or future for myself in the area I wish for is something I regret sincerely. The concept I'm anything but an insufferable and revolting train wreck of a human being who never should've tainted the notion of artistic endeavor, is something I never won't feel guilty about manipulating people into not believing.

And the few times I would attempt something, scrambling to figure out what would work for me, I would go nowhere. And any mark I ever left was beaten down. This makes sense, this is what should happen. Every attempt I make at creating or just doing anything worth acknowledging deserves to be shot down however it needs to happen.

Be it by other people, my circumstances, or just myself, and my laughable lack of passion or initiative that separates me from those with value. Such as the one I've envied for so long. The one who can do it all, who executed the ideas I've had for literal years, who's my age, who's actually going somewhere and deserved to shine through.

This is right. Almost. Watching every dream I have burning and shriveling away as I dissolve and assimilate into an incapable drone doomed to go nowhere as long as I live, while observing the ones meant to pierce through the barriers that perpetually imprison me is being incredibly merciful to the likes of myself. And it's a shame and inherently a crime that it's not worse.

It genuinely repulses me to think I'm considered part of the same species as people such as Einstein, Van Gogh, and Mozart. I've spent so long hating the world only for it all to finally turn around once I figured it all out. The truth is, I'm an unending disgrace to the only things I've ever looked up to, and my only dreams.

I deserve all of the agony I receive, be it physical, mental, or spiritual. And I deserve to die for my actions. Any situation where I feel I'm not receiving adequate punishment, I will bang my head on the wall. I will beat my stomach with my baton. And once I have the strength within, I will exit life.

My existence has been a stain on this Earth. Figuratively, AND literally an accident. No one deserved to endure my bullying and toxicity, nor my sobbing and whining for it biting me in the ass. The concept of art never deserved my abhorrent façade of being capable of bearing it with my own hands, nor my pitiful reaches of desperation for the idea I ever would've equated to the greatness I witness in those I envy.

To think of myself being the one to advance and execute my ideas and gain significance and skill, after the things I've done, it's an insult not just to art as a concept but the human race altogether. Now that I think about it, it's good that my suicide attempt in 2016 wasn't successful, I needed to suffer more to account for my crimes.

I never should have been a concept, and I wish nothing but the worst for myself when I extinguish from existence by my own hands.",I'm a disgrace to art.

2022-11-13 16:17:21,depression,"Life just doesn't seem to get better for me. My entire life I've always lost, I've never won. Growing up(because of my medical issues) I was in the hospital all the time, there was even a period of time where I lived in the hospital. When I went to school, I was always bullied for my medical issues even though it was something I could not control. My parents(even though we didn't have a lot of money) tried their best to make sure I was happy, they would buy me stuffed animals and toys and bring it to me in the hospital. As I got older, they were always amazed at how I was able to be so happy even though I had to live with an incurable disease(still do). Because of my medical condition, I was not able to participate in any sports at school.(So my dream of being a baseball player was over before it even began) My half brother (let's call him ""rj"") decided to go live with his father when he was 15 years old, I still remember the day he left. After that, the contact with my brother became less and less. It got to the point where we would only see rj for one week every year. Then he went off to college and didn't come back until 2018, when he came back, he decided to live with us. Things were going good for once, or so I thought. He lived with us not even a month, then left home again. Before leaving, he told me ""it's okay buddy, it's only for a few months, those months sadly turned into years. The last time I saw him was 5 years ago, and during that 5 year span, my best friend died, 2 of my grandmothers have died, my aunt died, and my grandfather passed away a few months ago this year. In school, I sought out girls, but they all rejected me. This year I finally thought I won, I had gotten a girlfriend and she was beautiful and kind. It turns out that there is two sides of every coin, she turned out be a mental abuser and messed with my already broken heart. High school is unbearable because I see couples hugging and kissing at every corner, kids can be hella annoying, and the math teachers are terrible. The only thing that has kept me alright is music, but even some days even music can't help me. I miss the days of my childhood where even though I had a lot of painful stuff going on, my parents and I still had fun going places and doing things together. I don't even know what I want to do when I get out of high school, of if I even have the motivation for it anymore. All I do is sit down and play video games to try and get away from this world we live in now, but even now as I get older, video games don't feel the same way as they used to. I have no job, no license, my friends don't have time for me anymore and have all forgotten me. No one calls or texts, or checks up on me. I no longer have a girlfriend. (I guess nice guys do finish last) I feel lonely all the time and feel like I'm wasting my life, and every day has become boring.

Turns out, i was right, I'm resistant to that medication they were pumping me full of. The problem is we haven't found a medication that is appropriate for me, yet.....

These last 4 days have been really difficult...

I'm tired..... I'm tired of not being well.... I'm tired of advocating for myself at the drs constantly... 

I'm scared... I'm more than scared.. I'm terrified of not getting better. 

I can't seem to function. I can only do tasks for 5mins max. Any longer and I start to feel faint.....

I feel faint because I'm constantly on my last leg... And any little thing pushes me over.

I'm trying my best to get through each day. I really am.... I try so hard every day.. and I just keep reaching my limit...

I can't say this to any of my support network. I feel as though I've been burdening them all year. They're getting tired of it...

Idk what to do..",my year of Illness

2022-11-13 15:47:27,depression,"""Have a positive attitude, be positive, look at the bright side, have a positive mindset, good things only happens to people who have a positive attitude, stop being negative, be optimistic"" etc etc etc 

These are some of the terms i have been told for a long time and honestly they are not working for me. I tried, didn't work tried again, same results 

Now whenever anyone is saying these kind of words the only thing that run in my mind as they are saying it is this is just some bull shit,doesn't work, crap, does this person even knows what they are talking about or what I am going through, ah, shit here we go again. And then I feel sad and miserable again and then there is this constant feeling that everyone hates me they may not show it but deep down i know they hate and honestly I don't even know if they genuinely hate me or not

Does this happens with you as well or am i suffering from some different varient of depression xD. Any advice, suggestions, help.

Thanks",Is this false positivity or my ignorance

2022-11-13 15:44:33,depression," 

When we overthink, we feel upset. When we’re upset, we feel less happy. And when we’re less happy, we overthink things more.

Everyone — from your mom, to your boss, to the guy next to you at the gym — has an opinion about [**what makes you happy**](https://jrsunny.com/best-ways-to-stay-happy-in-your-day-to-day-life/). 

They’ll tell you about how amazing their life is going and how much better and happier they are compared to you. And don’t even get me started on social media and how it almost seems like everyone has it all figured out, especially when it comes to matters of the heart.

Thing is, none of those people are you and none of those people get it. They don’t know what makes YOU happy. Because happiness is an inside job. It’s a choice, not a feeling.

Every day our social media streams are filled with “the happiest moments of your life” and “the most amazing over-the-top weddings you’ve ever seen.”

Whether we’re scrolling through Instagram or watching the latest reality TV sensation, viewers are constantly inundated with other people’s seemingly perfect lives.

Mental health experts often say that social media can be detrimental to our mental and emotional well-being, but this is the first time I’m actually feeling it in my everyday life. 

I have become obsessed with measuring my own happiness against that of friends, family members, and complete strangers. Every time it just kills my happiness, and probably, it’s killing your happiness too. ",Why Overthinking Kills Your Happiness?

2022-11-13 15:28:51,depression,"So i want to preface this by saying that i struggle having cohesive thoughts and putting them into words. this also might come off as a lot of venting and i’m sorry if this isn’t the appropriate place for that. 

l have struggled with depression and anxiety since i was a child (23m now), of course i lived with a parent from a generation that believed that it’s worse to speak about it to professionals and that the best advice he can give is “if your not happy with what you have you’ll never be happy”.  I finally got myself on a track to move past my childhood trauma ( a whole novel worth of events but this isn’t what triggered how i feel now) and make myself some sort of life. 

 My parents split when i was 3 years old, it was a messy divorce and has all the check marks that follow. abusive step father, mother who didn’t put her child’s interests and well being forward, a disabled father who was stuck on his own issues to really take notice and care of what i’ve been through, being left to unrestricted access to the internet at such a young age, being socially alone for most of my childhood, being the overweight tall kid. the only saving grace is my father had primary custody . i grew up with a lot of just time to myself so i was always aware of the situation but could never control or fix it. 

I came into some money and moved into a place of my own. finally being free of the situations and was trying to do the normal thing of moving forward. I treated myself to doing the things in life i wanted to do, finally giving myself permission to have fun and enjoy life. 

I fell in love with someone at a very vulnerable time of change for myself and i regret it. He moved in a little over a year of us knowing each other and 6months of dating officially (long distance but he flew down almost every month , sometimes only a few week gaps in between) I was 100 precent honest about my issues and actively tried to get a handle on the things i needed to on my end to make it work. Unfortunately he only lasted 2 months actually here before he had a nervous breakdown about being far away from his family, understandable but i was made sure before he moved in for months if he truly wanted to move here, and moved back in with his family, never paying me for his portion of the rent agreement he made to me even after moving out. at first i thought it was going to be okay financially , but inflation and rent you can’t afford by yourself really just suck everything out of you. 

Every week since has been a new nightmare of how i fundamentally have to change my life and leave the sense of belonging i had built. having that ripped away by someone else is causing me to lapse back how i was just a few years ago. 
I also know and recognize my money management issues that worsened the outcome and that it’s not everyone else’s fault but i also got fucked over. I’m 23 and filing for bankruptcy because i simply can’t afford to live. I’m showing up late to work because time just seems to slip by, and when i’m there, i’m not fully focused on what i’m doing, most of the time not even wanting to be there even though it’s a job that i actually like with people i care about. 

i’m just tired of feeling like every moment of my life is lived in a state of panic, that it’s a inescapable dread every minute of every day that it’s crumbling. I find myself with more and more suicidal thoughts and just zoning out for hours at a time. I’ve barely had a proper meal in months. i can count on my hand the number of days i’ve had a full nights sleep since august.

I’m really exhausted from it all, the having to be personable for so long everyday because i don’t want to come across as someone who is always in crisis and needs constant hand holding, the feeling that i’m a burden to my friends who i care about more then my actual family. 

What really hurts the worse is the utter silence i come home to. nothing seems to really have purpose anymore, i can’t even cry, i just sit numbly while everything replays over and over and over in my head.",Exhausted

Roommate (who is also a good friend) and I made plans for today: go to the beach and go to the mall to do some shopping. We made this plan because she likes surfing and I needed to get something from the mall. Plus, one of our favorite restaurants is in the mall.

We start the day off at the beach but then things got sidetracked and long story short she ended up doing stuff with our friend group instead because of complicated reasons. I just wanted to hang out with her today so I didn’t go. I asked her when she got back if she wanted to go to the mall still and she said no she was tired and she had already eaten with the our friends. Then she took a nap. When she woke up I asked her if she wanted to hang out tonight at home and she said she wanted to go to a game night that our friends had planned. She went and I’m just falling apart.

This is not a big deal. We can hang out any other day. And yet I can’t stop sobbing. I was looking forward to today so much. I know the way I worded it made her sound like a jerk but she’s really not and I have no reason to be this upset. I’m feeling so anxious right now and I can’t stop crying. Why am I so sensitive?

2022-11-13 14:14:46,depression,"For starters, I've tried to meet people for the better part of six years so, I didn't have to feel so alone every day, instead of finding kindness, compassion, understanding, and decency. I've found nothing but users, abusers, liars, con artists, and out right animals. 

My ""rules"" for interacting with *anyone* you've met online are:

* People make time for what's important to them. 

Someone once told me that, and I have never seen it not be true, I've had so many people tell me they're ""too busy"" to talk to me, what they really meant what they're ""too busy for me"".

 * Never get attached. 

It really doesn't matter if it's someone you've fallen in love with, or your best internet friend for X years, they can and *will* trade you in for the next best thing the first chance they get or the moment you become *slightly* more work than you're worth.

* How you feel, what you want, or what you think **do not** matter, only the other party matters.

I've met so many people whom describe themselves as ""caring"" or kind"", and they've always made me believe I could rely on them to vent or to just get my feelings out, guess again! The *moment* you do that, is the moment they pretty much tell you they did not want to hear any of it. 

* If they seem too good to be true, it just means they want something for you and will lie as much as they have to to get it. 

It could be money, time, attention, affection, it really doesn't matter. They only want what something, and will take it by any means necessary, and they do not care how they hurt you or leave you once they have it. 

* If someone wants to talk to you, they will. 

If you texted someone X-amount of hours ago, they've said they're ""not busy"", and haven't responded it's because they do not want to talk to you at all, in fact, they probably would prefer if you outright didn't exist anymore.

* When someone get bored of you for even a moment, you're gone instantly, without warning. 

Pretty self explanatory unfortunately.  

* Never expect even 1/10th of the effort you put into the relationship from the other party. 

If you make sure you're there for them, and do everything you can to make them feel safe or validated, do not expect the same treatment, you'll be lucky if they even remember you're alive most of the time, let alone, go out of their way to make sure you feel similar to how you're *expected* to make them feel. 

People have always wondered how I stayed kind after all the times I've been treated like shit, but not anymore. I don't care about anyone really anymore, because no matter what I do, no matter how hard I try, I am **always** treated like shit. Life, people, god, or whoever else got what they wanted, I'm pretty much just bitter with the world. I just wanted to be treated like a person, instead I was met with criticism, contempt, and half-baked advice for how my life has played out.","I've learned so many thing about interacting with people you've met online, and none of it is good."

2022-11-13 14:04:43,depression," What is really worth occupying a humans time with? what is value or meaning or pleasures? if not just delusions, distractions, and arbitrary values we give things? Must we find meaning or must meaning find us? and don't some of us never find such things? Are these things just distractions in themselves? is finding meaning not just another maze we are never meant to escape? from my perspective meaning is no different from a religion just something we believe to have value because one has tricked himself into seeing value where none exists. And I wouldn't say this is wrong in itself why is it wrong to delude oneself if he enjoys such delusions? as all actions is for the self regardless of the altruistic outcomes. Am I bored because I lack creativity? have I tricked myself into wanting the unobtainable? The fruit of truth is bitter and unsatisfying, you spend time learning and absorbing information just to reflect on how little you actually know, and the cycle repeats itself, until you are nothing but the personification of indifference, you do not want and when you do, it is only to be freed from your limitation of your physical form; As this form does tire of such monotonous and seemingly futile tasks; My resolve for truth does not surpass my biological needs, as both are one in the same, and so I find myself feeding my needs only to feed my desires for truth, that seems to have no more purpose than to keep me alive as long as possible to increase my chances of reproduction, this tricky thing we call evolution has a way of using everything we do and think to it's own ends even if it becomes futile in the end. And so Why truth over delusion? though I cannot see a way to go back into delusion as Pandora's box is already opened in my case, I don't see why I must put so much value on truth, anymore than on delusions or lies, and so why must I strive so much if it's all just for this individual I call ""me"", why must I feed his desire for truth, it only tears him apart, it only causes him insatiable amounts of boredom, not even an ounce of anger from his inadequateness to fuel his drive to truth but instead feelings of boredom, angst, tiresomeness, depression are his results in return, and all to feed his ego, this primate, this human, this ""I"" evolved from ape. This journey of life has been this ""I"" chasing a banana, no different from any animal before him. My banana just happened to be called ""truth"", some call their banana's love, power, ambition, uniqueness, fame, skill, food, drugs, sex, entertainment, danger etc. But it all ends the same, you may change the cause &amp; effect route of the world but what do such things matter when you were always destined to do so, even before you had thought of your desires, the variables were already in place to set you on such a path, and some may enjoy the path laid before them, but mine seems rather dull, repetitive, and most importantly in vain.

But he did end up going to jail, the asshole was also molesting two of my cousins and two of our friends. I found out at my oldest child’s 16th birthday party (I was a young mom) he was eligible for parole the first time. It happened so fast. Since then he’s been up two more times. I go in front of the board every time and poor my heart out to more strangers (therapist after therapist and psychiatrist after psychiatrist know my story) about how he ruined my life and I am not safe if he gets out. It seems that every time I start to get to a good place with my medication and therapy to where maybe just maybe I’ll be able to have a semi normal life I get that damn letter or phone call saying he’s eligible for parole again. I know deep down he’s only doing this to torture me more. To let me and the others know he still has the control. Because his max sentence would most likely have him die in prison, he’s reached that minimum so he can just keep asking and asking. And we can do nothing and hope they make the correct decision. But I blame myself for enough without letting myself talk for ten minutes and tell them why he CAN NOT get out.

2022-11-13 12:02:15,depression,"(A little long, sorry just need to vent). 

I just moved away from home (FL to CA, USA) for the first time after recently graduating college. I’ve always struggled with change but I thought I’d grown out of it. Doesn’t help that I overthink a lot, and I struggle with depressive episodes (latest one was directly after my birthday in August). 

I had a whole 2 months of time left at home where I wasn’t working and I basically just chilled and hung out with friends and family. I couldn’t wait to move out, like I was planning how I was going to set up my room and where I’d go to the gym and how I’d start new hobbies, how I’d be traveling on weekends, how I’d be going out to meet new people, etc. Basically, I was excited to start my career and making good money. I started martial arts and working out consistently during that time, trying to cook better and keep up with macros and stuff. I traveled, went out. Everything was fine and I felt like a normal person again, and like I had something to live for. 

I’ve been at my new city for 5 days and I was surprised, I felt fine. Almost made me feel guilty. Well, I just moved in with my roommate today and everything just changed and I have to hold my breath to keep my voice from trembling when I talk. I miss everything, I think back at how fast time went by and I wish I hadn’t spent it yearning to leave and cherish the last few moments I had left at home with friends and family. And the realization I’ll never be able to experience the same again hurts worse. Everything just seems so overwhelming, like I don’t even know how to start making new friends and doing things and enjoying my time here. Doesn’t help that I’m still not over a “casual” relationship from earlier this year, so I want to go out and meet new people but the thought of it is exhausting.

Kinda makes me feel like a loser. I know I’ll need time to adjust, but I really though I had matured as a man and was ready to go independent but I guess I haven’t/wasn’t. And this is not like before where I could just give up and come home. I’m across the country and I have to be here because I’m a working professional now.

So Im curious about If I could have depression because the symptoms matches but I dont really feel depressive so maybe any of you is feeling the same way. I know that I should be talking to a professional about this but its saturday and im just curious. Im 25 yo, I have a beaufitul family, friends and a nice life. Im a programmer and me and my family are good economically. The thing is that I always feel tired even tho I sleep well and do exercise. I really like coding but I dont feel motivated at all, I cant concentrate and I feel like I suffer coding. I also get overwhelmed too easily. I feel like everything that I do makes me tired but 10 times more than it should. Im always so sensitive that anything can make cry, for real. I dont really wanna date anyone (sometimes I feel attracted to some women but when I think about dating and all that stuff I feel like I rather stay home). I enjoy hanging out with friends but some friday/saturday nights I like to stay home alone and do nothing. I also have a very low self-esteem and I feel judged sometimes. I've never had suicidal thoughts but sometimes I feel like living is tiring and ask myself If never to have been born wouldn't be the best. But after that I come to the conclusion that living is good and I should be enjoying it. Thinking about the future gives me anxiety, like a lot and I dont really know what I want to be in like 5 years.

I'm just not sure what to do with the feelings I'm having right now. Feels like a hurricane of failure, inadequacy, and uselessness. I could do so much more with my life, not only for myself, but for others as well, but it feels like I squander all of it in the damn labyrinth that is my brain.

I don't have a bad life - my family is great, if sometimes rough around the edges(nothing abusive or anything, just normal differences in opinion on various things or whatever, I don't doubt that my family loves me and I love them), but then, what family isn't? Don't have an excuse for being as miserable and useless and I am, but here I am.

Guess it all started sometimes after being in college - don't know how it started, but nothing really matters to me anymore, expect the happiness of the people I care about.

Sometimes I wish there weren't any people that cared about me, so that I wouldn't feel this way, and could go away in peace.

Sometimes I feel like some people just aren't meant to live - but the only person that it feels like it applies to is me. Sure some others think it too, but I don't want to think badly of people.

I would have no trouble just withering away if there were no people that would be deeply affected by my passing, but as it is, I couldn't do it to them, so all I can really do is just spill the things I'm feeling to reddit while drunk and not having myself suppressed or whatever, hah.

Just in case, you don't gotta tell me to not do anything drastic, or anything like that. I'm not planning on doing anything foolhardy, just pouring it out to a reddit for the first time of my life, lol.

Sorry if this post isn't coherent, or doesn't have any proper structure, but I just needed some way to get the things on my mind out.

If you are in a similar situation as this, I'm sorry that life hasn't been more kind to you, I wish it was different, but I guess the world, as of whole, has no care for something as insignificant as the infinitesimally small existence that the lives of animals on a tiny ass planet is, not that it likely has any consciousness or whatever, hah.

Feel free to ignore this dumbass post, just seen people posting things on this sub before and I guess I felt some inclination to do this myself, as well.

I have been in therapy and talking to my parents about my mental health and depression for 15 years, it seems really confusing to me that my dad never shared this about himself. It probably would have been nice to know I wasn't alone or had someone close to me that understood.

My mom was abusive and that's what kick started the worst of it. I am living with it but it's even worse now. I have chronic pain and no one can figure out why. Everyday I wake up with intense back pain and headaches. Throughout the day it gets worse with ear pain and unexplainable jaw pain where I had my wisdom teeth out. There are days when I have these pains and can't stop from thinking about dying. Sometimes when I'm laying in bed and can't move because of the pain I just sit and think about death. I cry often because it's just making the depression worse. I'm scared of death but I'm afraid the pain will get bad enough that i decide I've had enough.,My pain makes me want to die.
2022-11-12 13:32:40,depression,"First ever post here. 

Took me a long time to accept that what I’ve been dealing with is probably depression. Started out not feeling myself with my ex, lost interest and desire to do things I used to enjoy: working out, running, motivation in general. Joined the military and pushed through it. Still didn’t have that push, that desire you had as a kid to be all you can be. Just kinda did everything on autopilot, going through the motions. 

Made it through a tough training. Won’t discuss what to say anonymous. My ex broke up with me (after 4 years) citing distance. The next 6-9 months we’re really rough. A lot of dark days. I’m a strong guy, lifting has been something I’ve been great at and I have a few medals for it to my name. Lost a passion for it quickly. Found myself struggling to get through workouts. 

Fast forward 9 months and I fell in love with a girl who gave meaning to my life again. Spent nearly every day with her and I felt new, repaired, best I’d felt in years. But I got orders to somewhere else and so did she. We’re still dating long distance and there’s a good chance (she thinks certainly) I’ll be stationed where she is now. I hope so. 

But I’ve been struggling hard the past month. I’ve been without here about 3 months now. We’ve made visits twice now and I hope she comes out for Christmas. But my gym shut down, I no longer have access to a pool, my garage gym doesn’t cut it, I don’t have friends and I drink alone on the weekends. My girl and I FaceTime a lot and we truly love each other but she has her own life and social life and I’m doing nothing right now. I’m awaiting new training and essentially not doing much. Been really hard on me and I’ve fallen back into a rut, I sleep during the day, have no motivation, try to workout and it doesn’t work, can’t sleep and drink 5/7 days of the week. I know it’s back.. 

I just don’t know what to do. I’m miserable and I hate it.  Missed a big function because I didn’t want to go alone when everyone had a group. My girl went to hers and had a great time which I’m glad but wish I was there or had friends to go with where I’m at. It’s been a really hard month on me. I’ve thought about trying to find a new gym or a boxing gym. There’s not many great ones, I’ve tried them all in my city and I know I’m a little picky when it comes to gyms but I know what I need and the one I had shut down. Any and all advice would be highly appreciated, please know I can’t or won’t just reach out to services because of my job, I have no ideations or desire to self harm.",It’s Back; Been a Hard Month

The side effects that I have experienced on SSRIs so far: 
- OVERSLEEPING so much that I missed 2 EXAMS and so many classes (highly uncharacteristic for me)
- waking up and then not being able to get out of bed bc I had no motivation 
- sleeping a lot but then yawning throughout the day ??? 
- I used to have vivid dreams before starting Zoloft, and I noticed that while on it, I don’t remember my dreams at all
- lack of motivation (more intense than ever before and all I really wanted to do was sit in bed and watch Netflix even though i literally have so much work to do) 
- lack of concentration 

- when I started it, I had an increase in anxiety 
- upon increasing the dose, I noticed that I started to pick at my fingers and made my cuticles bleed (I did this at time when I was feeling stressed) 
- also started chewing my lip because I was so anxious (kept chewing it so much that it started bleeding, and when I woke up the next day, it looked like I got lip fillers) — anxiety mostly related to not being able to concentrate on studying 

- new feelings of depression and feeling like a failure mainly related to/ caused by not attending classes and missing exams

2022-11-12 12:32:00,depression,[removed],I feel like I've wasted my life because of this. 6 years of depression and I know it's never going away even with medication and therapy. fml
2022-11-12 12:28:58,depression,"Hey,

This is kinda a long post, but I feel really emotionally down that I feel I need to write this much to express my feelings. I am feeling extremely depressed lately and I really want to get my feelings off my chest to people who can hopefully relate to me.

I've felt like this ever since I got into my dream school, being a good school. The day I got accepted, I was ecstatic. I started running around my house due to the sheer excitement that I got into the school I considered my dream school. However, someone asked me if I got in and asked me about my ACT score. Admittedly, my score was on the lower end of the ACT range of students accepted but it was strong enough to be considered. He then questioned how I got in, but someone who had a near-perfect SAT score didn't get in. Additionally, someone who carried us all in our Physics class got rejected altogether. At that moment, my self-esteem was crushed. I thought I was qualified to go, but there were people who were way more qualified than me and didn't get in. I didn't understand it, why would they accept me instead of them?

Fast forward to August and I arrive at college. I came in thinking I would do amazing things. I came in thinking that I would be an amazing student. I came in thinking I would get an internship.

No, even on day one, I learned that almost everyone is more talented than me in almost every way conceivable. They're fucking USACO gods, NMS, app developers, S-tier athletes, math elites, and entrepreneurs. What useful shit have I done in my life? What am I good at? Why did I get in if the AO knew I was surely not qualified?

Fast forward to my first test. Ever since I got my first scores back, I saw it as irrefutable evidence that I don't belong at my school. I did worse than average. I sought to deny it by working harder, but I somehow did even worse on the second midterms. Meanwhile, everyone I knew did way better than me or scored perfectly on the exam.

I also know for a fact that everyone knows much, much more than me and I am a complete dunce in almost everything. I am the one always asking for help, how to do things, and constantly studying (and failing).

Lastly, this is something a bit more personal but seeing romantic relationships makes me feel horrible. I've never had a relationship and frankly, it's because I'm too shy to ask anyone. I really do want to be loved and appreciated, but it's really fucking hard. There are people that just go together, and I feel that there is just no one for me.

I'm frustrated, depressed, and having near-suicidal thoughts every single day. I feel like a loser and n idiot. Hell, I was straight up about to cut my arm until my roommate walked in and I didn't do it. I don't even think I have Imposter Syndrome, but rather I'm straight up not cut out for my school. Every day is a constant battle and I'm starting to lose hope as the days go on. At this point, I feel an attempt is inevitable.",Feeling depressed and nearly suicidal
2022-11-12 12:28:36,depression,"I have always been insecure, i engage in dating apps and talk to guys im not even interested just for a bit of attention. This year i fell in love,but we were toxic so things ended and i just fell into depression again. My ex blocked me and there is no trace of him, we were talking everyday even as friends and now i see he wants to move on. This caused me severe stress, anxiety and depression. I never had so many pimples in my life. I was feeling really shit and then i started to accept this and try to move on as well. Just as i was in my healing process, i see a bump in my privates. I panicked so bad, last year i had the same bump in the same spot and even though it was painless and nothing like the pics you see on google, the internet told me it was herpes. My gyno said it looked like herpes but that i should do a couple of blood tests, i did and then both negative i was so happy and relieved. Now this happened again after one year and a coincidence that i was super stressed? I feel  scared, hopeless, fearful of what my life can be like if i find a positive result. I know is not gonna affect my health but it’s the rejection and feeling way more insecure I can’t take. I haven’t told this to anyone cuz im ashamed and probably won’t even wanna know my status. Im scared and I don’t wanna face this.",Not hopeful or confident on my future (F21)
2022-11-12 12:28:04,depression,"I can be happy, sad, numb, or whatever but I never really seem to want anything.

2022-11-12 12:23:44,depression,"Honestly I should move to Hollywood and start acting with how good I’ve become at faking happiness and normalcy.  I’ve found good people to date and be friends with and yet I’ve smiled maybe twice genuinely in the 2 years?  I’ve read from countless major philosophers,  psychologists, and health journals looking for a solution to losing 30 pounds of muscle and pushing with everything I have to not sleep for 16 hours a day. But all I see is black.  The  massive influx of knowledge has only left me lost and alone.  My good friends I’ve grown up with,  who’ve known me when I was well, happy, and driven call me for advice and laughs.  Fat chance I tell them the one they look up to is as put together as a 1000 piece puzzle broken and scattered across the floor.   I didn’t want to take meds and have been holding off the urge for all these two years.  I’ve determined that I’m going to change my environment and sharpen myself through trial and tribulation.  I’m dropping out of college,  going to a city I’ve always loved, and I’m going to start life anew.   My parents will definitely rip me a new one but I have no options left.   I need to try something, anything,  to come out of this fu%#ed up tunnel alive and well.  If I stay where I’m at I know my dream of 10 kids and a loving wife in the middle of Montana is never going to be a reality.  For them, and for me,  I’m going to press the red button and put it all on the line.  I pray we all find the strength to keep holding on and to not lose sight of the things we want when even the simplest task seems unmanageable.  Much love, C",Nothing to Lose

I know I’m not old but I really feel like my life will now just be spent going through the motions, waiting for my own death. I have no happiness, or any idea of what would make me happy. And I don’t have anyone to talk to about this - so here I am on reddit lol

Why do I cry still after its been so long but so short?
Why do I want to call you every night?
Why do I think of you everyday even when I know I'm happier now?
Why do I still cry every night and dream of you?
It's just so crazy so crazy that I fell in love with your soul. It's just so crazy I loved you unconditionally. I remeber crying one day to you. 
""Begging you why can't you just love me the same? Why do you have to get so angry. I just wanna love you....
I just wanna be with you
I just want us to be happy
I'm so tired of fighting over small stupid things. I just want to be the one you want.
So please stop being so mad. Please....""

I fell so deeply into you. And you didn't. After I left. You moved on in 3 months.
It killed me
Broke me
Shatter me into a million pieces
Pieces that I can never put back together
So im just here writing out my soul. Onto the ever lasting internet. Where I can't really be heard. But be heard. I really wish you were here with me still. To see how much I grown. To see how much I changed. And to be the man you always wanted.

I remeber all those silly moments. The way you smiled. The way you laughed. The way you walked the way you talked. And especially the way you held me when I had no one but you.
 All those night we stayed up until morning. Just talking about whatever was on our mind. Just every little thing about you was beautiful to me. 
I wish I told you that more. I wish a lot of things. Even though I said I would stop wishing. But I keep wishing for our love over and over.

My soul still cries for you. Still waiting for you. Still begging that you comeback one day. So I can hold you forever and never let you go.

Because I fell in love with you. In love with every single little piece of you. Every single thing about you. Past the beauty of your psychical silhouette. It's undescribable. No words can truly speak the way I felt about you. Because it was the beauty of your soul that I loved.

I have struck the balance pretty perfectly and my CS work is very flexible around my musician life. I have got to play on some of the biggest stages in the country with some major label artists, grammy nominated artists and even got my own music up and running with gigs and recordings. It’s been such a successful and fun year,

* Friends left me a long time ago, I won't blame them. I know how it is to be around me. I have social anxiety so it's really hard for me to bond with new people, and I don't have interest in any activity, hence the second point...
* I'm bored, all the time, I try and I try but I just can't enjoy my life.
* I don't function normally, even taking a shower everyday is a chore for me. I don't have a job and I'm totally broke.
* I can't sleep at night anymore.
* I'm ruminating, a lot.
* No treatment or therapy really worked yet.

I waste a lot of time crying over wasted time. I have regular ""breakdown"" where I will just cry, sometime all night long.

Worst thing is... I have a huge lack of affection. Like... I get it, I have pets, I can hug a pillow or something like that... BUT I really need a real hug right now, with a real human being. I can't even remember the last one...

I even thought about a ""professionnal cuddler"", but as I said, I'm too broke for this.

I just feel pathetic, worthless, hopeless...

I'm too scared to live but I'm scared to die...

Why go on living anymore ? :/","Feeling lonely, hopeless, tired..."

2022-11-12 10:33:17,depression,"Hi guys. I am posting here because I've been dealing with extreme depression recently. I have been struggling with doing anything productive outside of work other than studying. I immediately stopped doing any hobbies I used to have as soon as I started working.  I am currently in a position that is considered underpaid in my field. Technically, I am an Actuary. All my friends with more or less the same job make at least 20-50% percent more than I do (I've asked) for less responsibilities and a better work life balance. My position does not offer me study assistance like theirs, so I normally spend 20-25 hrs. a week studying for exams on top of working full time. This has caused me to go into serious withdrawal and the need to decline events that I would otherwise go to. My coworkers, boss, and parents are encouraging me to continue taking more exams despite it offering me no benefit. I do not receive wage increases or any incentive for taking exams. I even need to pay for exams out of pocket which has cost me up to $2000 so far this year. My company expects me to continue taking exams in a lower position, with no additional pay, and on my own time. With the low pay, lack of incentive, and no free time I am extremely demotivated to do anything outside of work. What can I do to make my life better and get back on the right track? I don't want to sit around and do nothing anymore.",Fighting Serious Depression and A Lack of Motivation

Tried focusing only on work, tried the opposite, just doing my job and actually tried living a bit.

2022-11-11 14:27:28,depression,"M, 29, been depressed since 2019, with 1 attempt to take my life earlier in 2021, and only just now in talks with a counsellor and doing a CBT program.

This isn't about CBT or the counsellor. I've done all that for my anxiety when I was a teenager over a decade ago. None of it is helping right now.

This is about being kind to TIME and the gym. 

One of the worst things I could hear was ""be kind to yourself"" because I was (and still am) in a position of having no ""cause"" no ""larger thing than myself"" and no ""passion"". 

I got angry when my friend told me ""you literally do not know what will happen tomorrow"". I said I do, and he said ""only because you're ensuring it by your behaviours of today. Want something to happen, but feeling overwhelmed right now? Either go back to sleep or dedicate your time for today to do 1 thing where you don't know the outcome.""

So I applied for a job online (I was jobless, and jobhunting was the 2nd main thing on my mind alongside existentialism, this was probably the thousandth job I'd applied for). 

The next day, nothing. Hah! My friend was wrong, life is crap, as I fell asleep. The next afternoon however, I get a phone call as I'm seeing no reason to get out of bed again, but it was for an interview for the job.

Cut the story short, I got the job, it wasn't something I was invested in, but something I'm blaggable at, and because I wasn't bothered, I used this attitude to fight for a 10k pay rise from the previous job I'd had. It worked.

I've been there 3 years, and no, money does not make you happy. Still miserable, I thought ""when was the last time I was happy"" and then it dawned on me that I'd quit the gym many years ago. But I had no energy or desire to go in the first place.

After months of thinking about the seed I'd planted in my mind (since nothing else was making me happy, even spending time with loved ones and going on holidays etc) I decided to join the gym.

I had no energy. And anxiety. But I walked in, and picked something that looked the most fun.... I treated my inner child as though I was in a playground. Screw what others think.

I had such a fun time messing around (safely) I went back. and again. and again. 6 months on, I'm still not doing anything as near as what I used to do in my early 20's, but I'm still waking up at 5am, buzzing and ready for life.

Coupled with intermittent fasting, on an 18/6 split (I do have quite a bit of fat) and I feel alive again.

Still thinking of existential thoughts, but now not getting down by them as I've learned to \*live in the moment\* more, and get out of my head and into my body, I took the same advice, and did something crazy earlier this week. I messaged my crush. Yes, I'm 29 and have a crush, so what! and she actually said yes to going on a date! Even if it doesn't happen, I'm the happiest guy alive, just for having some form of acceptance!

TL/DR: 

\- It is tough, and I'm sorry that if what you've read angered you (it would have done with me last year) but honestly, please, just be patient.. life is a journey NOT a destination. It has shit bits, but there's also good bits. Just gotta wait it out and be patient.

\- Get more into your body. Don't worry about getting out of your head. Do something physical even for 1 minute. ANYTHING

\- Do something today where you don't know the outcome

I haven't been on successful date in three years since my ex ruined what's left of my confidence and mental health. The only company I've had has been sex workers, and now I can't even afford them anymore. All I wanted to do in life was be a dad, be a husband--a house husband, sure, but the only thing I'm good at is taking care of people and it actually brings me joy. I wanted to write and create. I wanted to get in shape. Every opportunity I've ever had has been taken by having to take care of family, exes railroading my life, or by just not fitting in. I've tried. I've tried so hard.

2022-11-11 13:40:49,depression,"Been in for nearly a total of 8 weeks. Been 3 weeks on 300 XL. 

I started feeling my depression lift the most at the end 6 weeks and then had some weird days that I felt ""spaced out"" or disconnected. The spaced out feeling went away and now I noticed that today I felt very ""bored"" and apathetic towards things. 

Like, I would look at my baby and not feel as connected. 
---i was telling my therapist that nothing really seems interesting or appealing and I feel bored or that things just feel like work. She thinks I just need a hobby, but TBH I don't think that's it. 

Like, I have ADHD and eventhough some things can be a challenge, I atleast connect with people and find things enjoyable or interesting. 

FUNNG THING IS---I take my dose at 7 am and it's now midnight and I DONT feel apathetic. 

Do you think this means my dose is too high and at this point it's at a lower accumulation in my body...or do I just need to give myself more time to adjust?

Likeeee, don't want to be depressed, but also hate the apathy. Not on any other meds. 

TLDR: noticed that I'm feeling weirdly apathetic, umotivated and bored, but then 17 hours after dose these feelings fade away. Is the dose too high or just need to give it more time and that's the depression breaking through?",medication dose too high or am I still adjusting? (buproprion).

2022-11-11 12:51:18,depression,"I (24m) have had depression pretty much as long as I can remember but only started therapy recently. I have been in therapy for a little less than a year. But I hate my sessions and dread going to them. Everytime I have an appointment, about an hour beforehand I contemplate canceling. 

I hate the act of opening up about everything that bothers me and feel like talking doesn't help me. In fact, if anything it makes me feel way, way worse because talking reminds me of everything I feel depressed about in my life. There are days where I'm doing alright, feeling pretty stable, but then I'll have a session and it will totally open up the floodgates. It's so triggering to talk about everything that I frequently just end up bawling for the rest of the night even after our session has ended, whereas if I hadn't had a session I probably would have just carried out the rest of my day normally – perhaps depressed, but not hysterical.

For example, I am a pretty lonely person and the fact that I have no friends is very painful for me to be reminded of. If I ever mention my desire for connection in therapy, it will upset me so much that it ruins my entire night. But it also feels weird *not* to talk about it, because it is a very real present issue in my life.

The style of therapy I go to is CBT. My therapist is very respectful, professional, kind, and seems all around to do a good job, or at least really want to. He tries really hard to have active conversations around what helps me and how we can structure our meetings best. I don't exactly believe that he is the problem. I feel like to an extent I am in control of what we talk about / what I think would help me. But honestly most of the time I have no idea what to talk about. *I am sad all the time. I have no friends. I have no motivation to do anything.* These are my problems. Getting them off my chest doesn't help.

The other reaction I have to therapy sometimes for some reason is defensiveness and anger. The empathy conveyed by my therapist makes me angry for some reason. I don't know why. I don't want to hear about how I should ""applaud"" myself for going outside today and taking baby steps. I don't want to be looked at with deeply sympathetic eyes and be told, ""That sounds really tough!"" or ""So many people feel that way."" Everything feels so cushy and patronizing and I hate it.

I consider myself a pretty sensitive and emotionally open person. I don't think I have some internalized stigma towards feeling vulnerable or opening up towards other people. If anything sometimes I do that too much within the personal relationships in my life. 

I talk to my therapist about this often of course, but most of the solutions he offers are like, suggesting I decompress before and after our sessions or something, which I do, but only helps me marginally.

I don't know what is wrong with me or how I can do better steering our sessions so that I get more out of them. I am a deeply unhappy person but I have no idea what would help me. This is a vent, but I also am genuinely open to advice and perspectives. Thanks for reading – I know this was long.",I hate therapy and feel like it only makes me feel worse

2022-11-11 12:49:33,depression,"I was suicidal in my adolescence. I could visualise how I was going to jump off from the building. Everyone was asleep and I got out of my bed. I walked to the door of my room. I held the handle too, but that was it. That was where it all stopped.

Ever since then, I had only one dream (I believe so, I am not sure) all my life until last month. It was me on top of the building ready to jump off. I used to lie to everyone around that I never had any dreams. Lately I've had several other dreams and I feel good about it.

But life has not gotten any better. I thought I would gain control of my life if I get a job. I got a job that paid well, but nothing changed. With the threat of marriage (in which my choice will be manipulated by my father) I said I wanted to study and that my current job was not the career path for me and I resigned. Now I study (for a job that can take me away from this city, if possible state) but it's getting very difficult. The emotional abuse (manipulation and control by my narcissistic father) does not stop. I don't study much and I feel useless. When I had my job, the time at office kind of neutralised the abuse but now I feel lonely. I watch my friends having the time of their life. Back then I watched them too. But now the difference is stark.

I have many more reasons to end my life now than before. But I am such a coward, I can't get myself to even think about it now.

I had 2 situations this summer that could result in my future suicide. Firstly I found out that I will never have a girlfriend nor anyone who loves me besides family. I spent an entire week crying all the time thinking this because I had fallen in love with a girl and I knew I had no chance. To make it worse, all my pain multiplied a few weeks later. I had just barely managed to get over the other girl and this new one appears. We talk for a few weeks and finally I confess to her and she confesses back. I’m happy again.

I felt better than I’ve ever felt. I actually liked myself for the first time. Then the very next fucking day she takes it back and says it isn’t a good idea and ends up ignoring and ghosting me. That is what sparked it even further. I started taking antidepressants because it was so bad and up to this day 5 months later I feel the exact fucking same.

I have tremendous pressure from my parents to succeed in school, and I feel like a fuckin waste or a parasite as a 22 year old loser who has nothing together. This is my fuckin last attempt at school with a near full ride at one of the best universities in the usa for engineering.

I don't want to let them down. I hide my pain because I'm so fuckin terrified of getting yelled and called a liar for showing my vulnerabilities. They try their hardest to support me, and I love them, but I'm losing my fuckin mind telling them that things are ok because I'm so scared of how they treat me when I'm open.

With this newfound debt in my mind, I just want to cry. I can't handle this. Plasmas not working, no ones getting commission money for my offerings online. I take surveys now which don't pay shit.

My friends tell me to get a part time, but my life is still semi-controlled by my parents. I can't get one unless I get a job in hiding...which I could. I do a lot of things in secret, but it just adds so much stress to my life, and I can't fuckin take this.

My last post was asking about the consequences of getting blackout drunk in my car, and they are so fuckin bad, but now I might genuinely do that tomorrow after my classes. I'm losing it. I just want the world to swallow me up.

I haven't drank for like a month, and I rarely ever get drunk. A month ago I was suffering so fuckin much. I was shaking and crying doing my homework, and I couldn't deal with it anymore. My parents weren't home so I went to the liquor store, bought a bottle, fuckin started demolishing it at home to ease my mental pain and suffering, fuckin spedrun all my work for school because the liquor removed my pain and allowed me to do my math calculations and shortly after I blacked out.",I want to drink or try drugs to cope with my mental
2022-11-11 11:17:07,depression,"I had a bad upbringing and it's hard to make close connections with people so ever  since I graduated in 2020 I haven't really talked to anybody other than the Co workers from my previous job who only made me feel more isolated over the years and since I've had no job for about 2 weeks I feel like I'm starting to go insane. Ever since my dad died 11 years ago this month, my mom never let me leave the house or have anyone over, and neither did we have internet so all the summers I was alone and had do deal with a bipolar mom I didn't fit in with anyone as my school and I also talked a lot which gave me the annoying kid status.
 
 I completely let go of myself and over the years I got fatter and more depressed. From 14-17 I had lots of thoughts about wanting to end my life and I also cut myself (which I eventually grew out of). I also would wear the same clothes a few days in a row and skip some days on deodorant, so I was fat, smelly, and annoying. Lots of people either hated me, completely ignored my presence, or talk to me if they felt bad for me, but even with them I felt like a nuisance, and didn't care enough about life to change that until years down the road.

 Once I graduated I finally started to take care of my hygiene (despite shower not working since 2019 so I have to use rags and wash my hair in the sink), and lost over 100 pounds which at one point I was 212 at 6'3 and I never felt better about myself physically. Even with all these improvements I still haven't made any new friends and all my time is spent playing videogames because I can't drive and I don't have anyone to help me practice so I feel stuck. 

 I'm 21 and I've had 0 progress in life over these 3 years after graduating. Just a job that I worked at for 2 years that I lost recently due to a mental breakdown that no one saw but I still broke a tv by accident so they dropped me (can't blame them). I have 2 friends but i never hang out with them becusse they're always busy, but even with them I feel like I am completely alone.

 For many years I had to deal with traumatic experiences, and my own unchecked self destructive mindset, but had no one to vent to or talk so whenever things were too tough I would just cry and hug my pillow until I fall asleep.

 Recently this year I had to deal with fighting at home, and having to see my mom's boyfriend drifting in and out of consciousness after he attempted suicide (he's much better now), and with my depression and anxiety already being severe it only caused me to be more paranoid about everything, and I always feel like I have no one to depend on to help me through tough times. 

  I could say there's my mom, but after how I've been treated over the years I will never be comfortable with telling her how I actually feel, becuase she will try to turn it against me and tell me I have problems (like she doesn't when she flips shit on me or a fast food employe) so I feel absolutely alone, and have been for a few years now. 

 There may be people from my school that I will occasionally text but i would hate to be the person to tell them my deepest feelings when we never spent a single moment together outside of school. Every time I talk to one of them I hear about how they're graduating college or moving in with their partner while I still live at home and can't even drive. Most people would consider me a loser. 

 I keep getting reccomended counseling but I have 0 insurance to cover that, and I also get reccomended to join Facebook groups where people get together but there are none in my town like that at all. I feel like whenever I do try venting on these pages I always get the same generic advice from people that would probably find it more difficult in my situation, as much as I hate to compare myself. 

 I feel like I actually tried making genuine connections with people instead of desperately trying to be the class down but ending up as the freak, things would've been much better. Something about seeing other men with friends and some with their girlfriends makes me feel inferior. Despite me not prioritizing a relationship like many neckbeards do, I still feel unachieved with my social life. 

 I've lost count of how many times people have told me that being alone is a good thing and how I should be happy being alone. I am very happy being by myself which every time I talk about isolation people think I'm not. What people never talk about is how spending so much time alone can sometimes cause your mind to wander off without someone to give you a reality check, and then when you start to feel like you're going crazy there's no one to help you.",How can I reach out to someone when I'm having a bad moment?

2022-11-10 16:52:21,depression,"(TW: kinda suicidal)

I have a lot of things I like.

Music, art, gaming, etc.

In fact, I'm taking a university course about music composition, sound design and audio engineering. Not sure if I'm the happiest in this course, but all of it is because I have so much doubt that never goes away. I enjoy the things we learn, just severe doubt that steals my motivation.

Anyway.

So what happened:

It felt like a less shitty day (cus everyday is shitty tbh). I made everyone dinner so felt like I deserved to play overwatch today (I usually only play on saturdays). I was playing overwatch and was on my 3rd game (which I was about to make my last) when my mum full on yelled at me, really loudly. I jumped from her sudden scream and ofc I was like ""what the hell was that for"". Then she proceeded to berate me, saying how I always play games. 

I play overwatch ONCE a week. I play genshin everyday to do comissions, spend resin, do events (which only take an hour total). 

I'm so sick of living under her rules, especially since they're so restrictive. I can't even go out to the city often to escape the house cus I live in a rural area, which is around 2h away from the city). 

Because she's been like this my entire life, I don't ever have the motivation to do anything I like, even if it's considered productive in my mum's eyes. It feels as if whatever I do, if it isn't my face buried in a book type of studying, it's a waste of time + I never have the motivation to get good at it; to feel good about doing it. 

Why am I even alive? What's the point when I'm not even good at what I'm studying? I'm absolutely terrible at audio engineering, sound design, and music composition. I've tried to make it work, but I just can't bring myself to improve. Now everyone is better than me, and I've wasted my money paying for this course.

My only thought now is to move out. Maybe beg a company within the audio industry to hire me so I can pay rent near the city. 

I want to buy a gaming PC set up. I want expensive music plugins like Kontakt or Splice. I want to do what I want to do. But to do that, I need to actually start, and take steps. 

My mum ruined it all. She makes those steps so difficult.

I know, she isn't gonna change any time soon, so I have to take responsibility for my own life and stop the blame game. But I'm so sad and hating life, I don't wanna do anything. .

She tells me I won't be able to survive the real world, but I don't care anymore. She is so immature and doesn't understand emotion. When I talk to her about emotions it's like I'm talking to a brick wall: she never listens to me and only cares about her opinion. 

I feel stupid crying about it, but this has been built up over probably 18 years, and definitely not the first time it's happened.

If anyone is suffering through similar things I am deeply sorry. I hope you get to fufill your desires as soon as possible.",My mum is the reason why I don't want to do anything

2022-11-10 16:52:02,depression,"When you can’t explain what’s going on so you just sit there soaking in all the pain. Nice and slow.

I feel like people demand from me what they don’t even do themselves.

I’m supposed to get over my shit and just go with it instead of dwelling on people did this and that. As if you could just do that and erase painful experiences from your brain.

You can’t but you sure can move on and let things go and smile and even still lend a hand at whoever, whenever, even if that person once let you down big time.

It’s what I’ve done all these years. I would get mad pissed and call people out but not only does no one ever admit their fault, I am made to sound as though I’m crazy for doing the right things. So I would instead just move on, the smart and healthy thing.

But when it’s me, then people just can’t move on at all, no. I must be punished severely because I did something wrong and so it can’t sit.

People have done things to me that they would kill someone for doing it to them. 

And I always let it go after going home and rummaging over and over. But not a moment before as I’d be absolutely incensed at the hypocrisy all day long.

But I’d go home and I’d do the math and see what I did wrong or not. In either case, I’d just move on. Wouldn’t forget it but would certainly move on.

But I’m always the victim of people not doing that and in their ignorance marking me as a devil for everyone to see. Such is the ignorance that people don’t even look at themselves. But I guess I can’t complain if not everyone is wise/kind enough to analyze themselves and what they did wrong. There’s also the part where they don’t see anything wrong done.

It’s driven me crazy.

The moment I act like people, oh I’m heard alright. For I am speaking their language. Say something along the lines of “guys, she’s not even 18 and even if she were, you’re fucking 30.”

Every time the answer is the same: her body’s ready and that’s all that matters. Of course that translates as “I can’t get girls my age and I’m horny asf so screw morality.”

I give up. I can’t win like this when you bend things like this.

I try to help but people think I want to be the one who has it all right or something. Yet another poor misconception.

God, I’ve always been clear about what I want.

But I guess people are so accustomed to lies and deception that whatever anyone says is probably a lie trying to show they’re better or idk people just make up all sorts of reasons just because they can’t admit they had something wrong and got corrected by someone they don’t particularly look up to. As if it were any less true.

I struggle with these because I’m naive and believe in change, in doing things in a better way.

But people don’t care. And I no longer have the strength to try again.

Imma go into healing now. Got to find a way to continue to show kindness despite having every reason to pull the plug on people and cut them off.

I’ve spoken a lot and I’ve tried a lot with people despite how much they’ve shat on me. 

I’m going for silence now. Always been at my happiest then, with no one there.

Good luck guyssssss!!!
 
Got a feel you’ll need it.

I don't have enough to give my mind to be engaged or fulfilled with.  And so I end up staring at online ""content"" for hours and hours until my eyes are pickled and my brain is buzzing like an unplugged amplifier.  Powered on, no signal, just noise.  

I am in a relationship I don't like very much and that I don't think is good for me.  But I don't want to work on it, I don't want to confront what they and I are doing that hurts the relationship.  I just want to leave.  

I am in an apartment that I don't like very much, even though like the relationship there is a lot I should appreciate about it, the negative takes over my impression.  And so I chose not to renew the lease and to move to a new place.  To leave, to uproot again, to start over.  And I wonder why my roots are stunted and I am malnourished after moving every year. 

I fucking hate moving.  I'm tired of it, it's stressful and I don't want to.  But I always leave.  I always abandon my problems that need whatever it is I don't have.  Patience? Maturity? Reasonability? Devotion? 

I just want to leave.  I always want to leave, I always let me lie to myself that leaving will be better.  Shocker: the grass is not greener.  The geographic cure does not work.  That 15% raise does not qwell the voices that have persistently chanted in your head that you are disappointment, wasted potential, a string of bad choices.

It's the only way to make a real change.  Running away from the unhappiness is not pursuing happiness or wellness.

It's inside, it's the only source that matters.  It will never leave me no matter how many times I try running away.",Dropping fast
2022-11-10 16:46:07,depression,"I lived a happy, normal life until I reached middle school. The only downsides were my home was always messy when I'm the kind of person who liked cleanliness.

I used to have friends when I was a kid, people liked me, I was funny, and respected despite being a troublemaker.

I had my first crush in 5th grade and was rejected twice by her. Then in 7th grade I went to a whole new school and my parents told me I'd never have to worry about that one girl again because I'd meet plenty. By 9th grade I'd been rejected by at least 25 girls I liked. I don't know why I pursued so many, maybe because the first few rejections destroyed my self esteem and I hoped that maybe one would like me.

As for friends, I grew apart from everyone I called a friend in my early years except one. The new friends I'd made from 7th grade to 11th grade ended up being extremely toxic, didn't like me and constantly made fun of me for everything. I joined a new friend group in 11th grade and they seemed so much better, they were actually nice to me and seemed like they cared about me.


11th grade was in 2021, and this is where things started to get really bad. First I lost one of my oldest friends to suicide, then a month later I lost my Grandpa who I hadn't been allowed to see for 6 years because of a family fallout. 

In November I'd finally found a girl who felt the same way about me. It seemed like, despite the awful things that'd happened my life was on track, it seemed like thing's were going well. Then everything went down hill again.

I tried my hardest to be the best boyfriend I could, I tried to be sweet and romantic and my girlfriend didn't appreciate it, she didn't like me for some reason but I tried to make it work. She ended up going off on me one night because I just wanted to see her one weekend. I didn't say anything hurtful back, not once. 2 days later she broke up with me, broke my heart and this marked the beginning of my depression. I kinda lost motivation and happiness, I was still kinda functioning but only because I had to. She then came back into my life because she was lonely and broke my heart again because she woke up one day and decided she hates me, then came back AGAIN, for the same reason only for her to break my heart again because she found someone else. Eventually we stopped talking completely and it hurt me, to lose my first love like that.


But could it get any worse? Of course, and it did. My 'friends' started to change, they started being cold to me, and then starting insulting everything I said and did, they made me feel like shit, they excluded me from everything, they disrespected me. I didn't have any other choice but to cut them off...

And now I basically have no one. Every friend I've made has been through being introduced by someone else, and I've realised now that I don't have what it takes to make friends, or find a relationship. The one I did have was pure luck, and she ended up hating me. 


The only thing I can say is I have my parents and siblings but no matter how close I try to get with them, I just feel emotionally and mentally unsatisfied. So it basically feels like I have no one.


So that's where I'm at in life now. I'm a depressed loner with no friends and countless romantic failures.


All people say is that 'you're so young, you've got your whole life ahead of you'

It doesn't make anything better saying that, this is supposed to be the best time of my life and I'm miserable with no friends, everyone seems to just dislike me and I don't even want to live anymore.

I just wish I had friends, and romance. I can't keep going like this. This lonliness is awful.

2022-11-10 16:32:03,depression,"A little intro: I'm a 25 years old highly introverted guy. My mother passed away when I was 16 which hit me hard. I lost a lot of motivation but I kept going and finished uni and now have an OK job.

Now everything seems to be falling apart. My grandma is having cardiac issues after recovering from COVID, not life-threatening yet but needs close attention. 

My girlfriend of 8 years, who has been my only emotional support and the only reason I want to have a future, feels like ending our relationship. I'm very introverted and it is often hard for me to show affection, spill out emotions etc. But she has (or had) always been there for me. I have mistreated her (my fault, no excuse) a few years ago. I made it up to her and we were normal for some years. It was not violence or cheating but that must have made an impact. Recently she suddenly expressed a lot of concerns about money, future and other things and said that maybe she wanted to leave me.. I convinced her to stay with me somehow but it definitely looks like it is slipping away.

Now my mind is filled with tremendous guilt, anxiety, helplessness, negative and suicide thoughts. Although my girlfriend is still ""with me"", she has been awfully quiet both verbally and on texts. I'm so afraid that I say one wrong word and she's gone. I've tried to be honest and told her about my feelings but her responses looked like I just annoyed her. 

Business is bad and my job is not looking good, I won't be fired probably but it's not going anywhere good either. All these plus a sick elderly at home has put me on the verge of collapsing. I have no one to talk to and I'm actively thinking of ways to end my life. I'm losing interest in everything including my lifelong hobbies. I feel like I have nothing to live for anymore. I know that I need to stop these thoughts but I can't help it.

If you have read all that, thank you, sincerely. I would greatly appreciate any kind of help or guidance. Thank you.",Sick family member; 8-year relationship ending; suicide thoughts; no one to talk to

2022-11-10 16:15:28,depression,"I needed an outlet so I guess here I am. Most everyone around me is tired of hearing this and the others I don't want to know. 

Anyway, I have this issue with a little thing called bipolar, which more than anything has become me being incredibly depressed. I have a hard time holding down a job and I'm very surprised my relationship has held up. I have done everything I can think to do, including medication, and nothing has helped. 

I have no want to leave this world. I love the people around me too much to hurt them that way but unfortunantly that has caused me to be even more depressed because all I care about are my loved ones not hurting, nothing about me. 

It has gotten to the point I've convinced myself my boyfriend doesn't love me, though I know he does. I just can't understand why anyone does. 

And I can't say anything about my thoughts due to it being a very sore topic for someone very close to me and I can't have them know I feel this way. I can't make them worry about me. 

I just want someone to isten to me for once instead of telling me it's genetics or I'm ""too young to be sad"". I just want someone to see it. Luckily for them, it'll never be too late physically, but what about emotionally? Mentally? Spiritually?

would call a homie has a distinct moment i can remember where i was treated like  trash i remember trying to vent about how my mom admitted to me being a acident and i was trying to vent but since my friend gave such generic response i forgot i had told him this already and i told him again and he went off saying this is like the third time you have said this getting pissed at me and completly shitting on how i felt, and this the same dude that years later would steal my jokes and make me look like a fucking idiot to impress this one girl and i dont know what he would say to her but i

2022-11-10 14:55:10,depression,"At first, sorry for my bad english, i'm brazilian.
So guys, first I would like to say that I'm really sorry for what you're going to read here, it's something I'm not proud of and it brought me MANY personal problems. I started to consume pornography at 9/10 years old, I started watching some adult programs on TV and over time this changed, I masturbated daily, between 1-3x/day, always consuming pornography to stimulate... Had a moment when that ""normal"" porn no longer satisfied me, so I started to consume more bizarre and heavy content, at 14/15 I started to consume a lot of hentai, I started to see several femdom, violent but not illegal content, but this started to turn into zoo videos, hidden footage, and the main thing that left me completely destroyed was the CP....yes, that's right. I consumed this when I was 17, it lasted a while, I knew it was wrong but not the absurdity it really is, my notion of ethics/morality was completely distorted, I believe because of the years of porn consumption, but when I got real and realized in what I was getting into, I stopped and went into a state of shock, intense anxiety, depression and suicidal thoughts that corrode and destroy me to this day, I don't allow myself to be happy for what I did, even though I knew that was not me (remembering that I never hurt or did something to ANY child)... Today I am 23 years old, I have dated in the meantime, I get along with women, I don't consume pornography anymore and these BIZARRE and DISGUSTING thoughts are almost completely gone, but the pain and guilt never left me... There are times when the guilt disappears for a brief moment and I'm fine for a few days or months, but it always comes back, and it always comes back stronger... I really don't know what to do, I already got rid of it, I know I'll never consume any of that again, and I will NEVER hurt anyone, but I can't forgive myself, I can't live like this anymore, suicide is already a tempting idea, but I want to live, I think about my family and friends, I feel alone and trapped inside my mind... I need help.",ex porn addict - request of help (serious)
2022-11-10 14:53:39,depression,"I (20m) haven't really been happy in a long time. Until recently, everything I've been dealing with has felt temporary or relatively normal and I've felt like I've made progress at times. After the past year though, I don't know how much more I can take. 

I kind of always struggled socially. I'm quiet and awkward with bad social anxiety. With the friends I've made there's been a lot of random situations over the years, as far back as I can remember, where I lose close friends over what feels like nothing or (frequently) get mistreated or undervalued to a point where I cut them off. I went through 4 or 5 different friend groups between middle school and graduation, with a couple of school transfers for 'fresh starts' along the way, with each group getting smaller. Since junior year, over four years now, I've pretty much been a loner. Covid hitting during senior year and ruining my first year of college definitely didn't help. 

I struggled the first year in college, but it was understandable with Covid and it being my first experience with college. All my classes were online so I didn't make friends and I just barely scraped by academically, mostly because of low effort on my part. I'm smart but average at best in school, never been a great student, but this was still pretty low for me. I did much better in classes my second semester, and was not too worried when I went home. I came back to school for my second year with hope. With some luck and effort to improve on my part, I finally got my first taste of a healthy college social life, joined a frat, went to parties, and had a good time. By doing this, though, I lost focus academically to a point where I had to withdraw from all my classes to avoid four failing grades. I also developed a severe dependence on weed. After I made the decision to withdraw, I found out the school wanted me to take the next semester off. I'm an idiot so I had planned to hide this from my parents, lie my way around it for now and tell them later, and an extra semester off would definitely get in the way of that. My school is extremely expensive, rents are high around here, and I have no financial aid, so I wasted a lot of money with this, and I felt painfully nauseous nonstop for weeks thinking about how I was going to tell them. Well, they found out on their own. That conversation was unpleasant. I had hoped I could come back and stay in my apartment, since we'd be paying the lease either way, but that didn't happen.  

Back home, I had no friends and nothing to do. I thought I'd lay low, work on myself a little bit, and come back to school for a real fresh start with everything a bit more sorted out. Of course, that would be too easy. A few months after I came home, my parents separated after more than 20 years of marriage. Not a clean or amicable separation in any way and they did not do well at keeping it between themselves. Throughout the whole process, I've found out more than I ever wanted to know about them and a lot has come up between my dad and I as well. I've already mentioned the lack of friends and I'm not close with my extended family so I've basically been going through all of it alone. To make up for it, I got a vacation with my dad out of it to see an event that normally might've been the highlight of my year. My dad made it clear before we even booked it how much he would rather miss it and didn't hesitate to remind me while we were there, but the trip was still great. The day of the event, I woke up at 6am to see my dad talking on the phone with his head in his hands. His mom had a severe stroke with basically no chance of full recovery. I've discovered a lot about my extended family over the past few years, mostly bad, and she's the one person I could never say a bad word about. We went to the event and I enjoyed it as much as I could, but obviously the mood was not great. That's still been one of the better days this year.

I definitely had some amazingly good things happen in the time I was home. I worked two jobs, one after the other, one of which aligned perfectly with my interests and the other combined my dream job with my more realistically likely career. I didn't get as much out of either as I expected, but I can't deny that I was extremely lucky to get even one of these opportunities at my age. Outside of those, though, I wasted nine months. The family drama got much worse, I hardly saw the few friends I have, and I spent most of my time outside work driving around aimlessly or playing videogames. 

I'm back at school now and again, I came back here with so much hope for some reason. Again, I thought everything was going well. I went to parties, thought my classes were interesting, even met a girl that didn't stop texting me after one date (first time ever). Now though, I might be in a worse place than last year. I go to parties almost every weekend and stand around awkwardly wishing I could leave, even with all my frat 'brothers' there. My social anxiety is worse than ever, I've lost all the conversational skills I gained last year, and I've hung out twice in the two months I've been here with a friend that isn't my roommate. That girl lasted to the third date before making an obvious excuse to leave dinner early and blocking me. Last year I was skipping classes to do other things or just because I didn't want to go. Now I have anxiety attacks and depression to the point where I'll get up early, get dressed, and pack my bag, only to stare at it and try to get the willpower to pick it up and go to class. More often than not these days, I end up getting back in bed to scroll instagram for hours at a time. I'm smoking an unbelievable amount of weed and nicotine, and because of that have little money for other things. I'm regularly skipping weeks of classes at a time because I just feel like I can't do it. I'm barely keeping up and at least one grade might be too far gone to save already. This doesn't even mention all the other basic areas in my life where I've just never gotten my shit together.

Even without everything else going on, last year I could barely keep up with any one aspect of the life I need to be leading in order to succeed here. I went home, had the shittiest 9 months of my entire life, and now I'm back in the same place with the same responsibilities. I'm not at all in the right space for college but I have nowhere else to go. I can't make it through any more time wasting away in my room in my mom's house. The way things are looking though, the next year is gonna look familiar. What's gonna happen when I fail out and go home this time? My dog dying? Can't really think of a lot of other ways things could get worse but I'm sure the world will find something. If everything was 'normal' right now I would still be in a stressful position with a lot to handle and learn. Right now I feel like I'm drowning.

Through all of this, I’ve grown to be in a state of depression at all times. In high school I was much happier and content with myself, but i’ve grown to hate my old self and the rest of the world. 
I have no motivation to keep going. I’m extremely tired all day and i force myself to eat, work, communicate with others etc. I do nothing significant. I am simply existing like an npc at this point in my life. 
I’m now in college and since i moved out i have a long track record of drug and alcohol abuse because i can’t stand the idea of starting a new life completely, but i have to. I’ve also attempted suicide one time and ever since then i have gone completely bitter about the world. Nothing makes me happy anymore. I’m a lonely mess full of self hatred. I’m doing bare minimum in life and throughout my day i don’t experience happiness like i used to. 
If i had it my way i’d be sitting in my room closed off from everyone else. Talking to no one. I hate what the world has become. I have a burning hatred for society and how fake and hateful the world has become. It seems like no one else feels the same way i do. I feel completely alone in these thoughts. 
I hate using platforms to complain about life because l know many people have it much worse. But this state of emotional numbness is beginning to seriously take a toll on me.

but I don’t need to be one to be tortured mentally every single day to the maximum

I was hopeless
I used to cry in the bathrooms knowing one day when I’ll be in high school it’ll get better well damn I was wrong, I’ve been through 5 schools, I was bullied in every one of them, each one had a different way of doing that, I’m always stuck in a “If I talk people either ignore me or use that against me, and if I don’t i’m a fucking weirdo and an easy target”
i’m fucking cursed, every friend group I had didn’t miss a chance at bullying me altogether, trying to me feel like a piece of shit, no not in a friendly way, not in a way that the boys do, in a way that they actually want to make me feel bad well they did,
and it doesn’t end there, it’s like that in all jobs I had too,

when they would be joking around and talking to each other I would try to join but they would ignore me or tell me “why is that table still not clean”
when I quit my brother told me that I quit because i’m lazy and a loser and that I should come back and he was mad when I didn’t
i’m fucking stuck now with no friends, no job, family mad at me,
fucking terrified cause everywhere I go 
I know my destiny and pray that this time it’ll be different
that I can be myself that I can be liked
that I can be fucking normal
and that’s only half of the story, still the main reason why I think I have no place in this world
why I don’t see myself finding a new job or going out and exploring the world
family thinks I don’t have depression cause I got nothing to be depressed about and i’m just a lazy fucker and I need to find a job to be happy or my favorite one by my brother “you didn’t try hard enough”",My life’s a sick fucking joke.
2022-11-10 14:15:52,depression,"I’m a young new mom. I have one baby and a loving partner. We struggle with money and rely on a car which has the check engine light.. but I’d say life is okay, at least that’s how it should feel. 
my anxiety, depression, and ptsd have been on the high lately. I’m not sure if it’s because of my life and triggers lately or because of the time I’m spending on the internet but I feel genuinely lost. 
all I see online these days is gym content and majority men making comments about fat people esp women like fat whales, pigs, not human insults and just some straight up really nasty demeaning comments about fat people. I’m fat myself and my soul just feels crushed lately. I wake up and want to change but how do you change your life when you can’t brush your hair because it’s matted and you barely shower and you struggle to do anything for yourself other than be a good mother.. 
I find myself at night just sobbing in bed like I’m in high school again because of my weight.. my depression hasn’t been this bad since I was homeless and I just don’t know what to do other than scream into the void of the internet. I don’t understand why so many people are hating on fat people lately just for existing. I wish I could crawl into a hole and just die, the only thing keeping me alive is my perfect baby and loving fiancé.is it actually possible to get out of this situation or am I going to be a self loathing POS for the rest of my life wishing I could be skinny so at least I would stop getting bullied for being fat…",destroying my life
2022-11-10 14:14:43,depression," As I sit here, I wonder what happened to a child that made her afraid of men, and then later hate them. Older men in particular. From memories my grandfather was nothing but good to me, except the times when he wasn't. The First time he wasn't was when I defended myself against his constant attack on my weight.  I told him. ""If you don't like how I look, don't look at me"". I was punished. I was told you don't talk like that to your grandfather. In my 12- or 13-year-old mind I didn't care.  I had noticed the women in my family had to make themselves small and not seen. They had to go along with what their spouses said, or their fathers said. I had such strong feelings of that was not who I was going to be. But it was inevitable.  A story I once heard about my mother pissing on her father after an attack, her silent rebellion. My grandmother being yelled at for putting a donut on the wrong side of a round plate. All memories that come to me while I wonder what's wrong with me and why am I like the way I am. I have no memory of sexual abuse, but I wonder why I am afraid of men, and why I will passively let them do what they want for fear of what will happen if I don't.  I fear anger from men, but a part of me will fight against it...My grandfather not talking to me on two different occasions for over a years' time; because I won't be the quiet do what you are told girl. Oh... a talk with my grandmother a few years after my grandfather died, her saying ""I loved him, but i feel so free."" Said at the age of 92. I won't be 92 and finally feeling free. I will die alone before I let that happen. I have been so independent...never feeling alone, but having society tell me that I am supposed to want a spouse, want a lover, want a companion.  All I see in that is being a mother to a grown man. I love being alone, I love the quiet, I love not worrying when this person will finally show their true self for what they are. It breaks my spirit when I am my true self, and it is used against me. And I get stuck. Stuck thinking if I just do this, or I just do that; things will change.  Nothing ever changes, but I'm told you're too cynical, you're to hard, you're too MUCH! I've made myself so small for so many years, I don't know my true self. I've made myself be everything everyone else needs, and never what I needed.  When trying to make myself my true person, I've been told, ""Well come on now, you can't expect that"". And now in trying to give my child the love I never had, I have made him my worst nightmare.  I wanted you to be loved and feel special and feel like you were the center of someone's universe. The thing someone lived for, was so happy to have you. Gave you everything that they didn't get in life. I struggled, there is no saying I didn't. But I gave you expensive clothes, trips, and toys. I told you I loved you every minute, you still say you love and miss me when you go somewhere. But it feels like you say that becaue it's what I said to you, and think that's what's supposed to be said.  Every time you cried or reached out; I was there. I was so happy to have you. I thought if I gave you all the things, I didn't have that we would be bonded, and you would love me, and we would be close. But now when you say you love me it feels like you think you have to say it. You are saying it to gage what's going on with me.  Because your actions speak so much louder than words.  I gave you almost everything you asked for. And I created a person exactly who was the worst to me. And now the one person I have ever loved doesn't love me, resents me for my addictions that I have used to cope and deal with. The addictions that keep me alive but kill me at the same time. And I realize I have no one. There is not one person in my life that loves me, that needs me, that chooses me. I hope in my next life I can retain some of this knowledge and learn from it and make different choices. I think I am close, I feel like it's just a grasp away.  But not this time around.  I won't give up until I'm told I have to. But I hope next time around will be a bit better.","I'm feeling sorry for myself tonight :( which I hate. I try to write my thoughts out, but never share, maybe this time it will help to share."

2022-11-10 13:58:13,depression,"i'm not good at sports. i never was. i would always joke around about having this ""balliphobia"" when i was younger whenever a ball would come flying near me in seconds. now that i'm older, i actually understand that i am total shit at sports. i don't know who to serve or whatever that means, i can't aim properly, i'm not a fast runner like i used to be in third grade. all of my classmates are willing to play any kind of sports game if they have the choice. i just don't get it. what's so fun about being scared about a ball hitting your face and you possibly getting a concussion or something? what's so fun about eight boys screaming at your face?

i remember trying to play volleyball with my friends and whenever a ball would come down to me they would scream at me, ""HIT IT!"" but i just couldn't because i was scared it i would miss or i would smacked in the face by a ball. or whenever a ball would come near me i'd have to it but instead i just stand there looking stupid.

a fact that makes me feel comforted and not alone is that my history teacher's son who is a few years younger than me doesn't like playing sports. just not interested. my teacher said he just likes watching those asmr videos and youtubers and stuff like that. i do too, which makes me feel like we're the same. it's a comforting thought.

look, i've played sports, just not as an after school activity, just for p.e. i don't know how i got through p.e. last year or the years before that, but i did. this year i'm just barely surviving on the edge.

i'm not athletic. i'll never be. i've tried it and i don't think it's right for me but i just feel so insecure about my skills because all my other classmates are so good at it.

those disappointed looks on the girls' faces when i ran to get the ball for them so we could continue playing. it was haunting, so i had to chicken out and walk my way over to the bathroom to just hide there.

now we're on bathrooms. bathrooms are so bittersweet. every day at recess it would be the same. bell rings. i get out of the classroom. i enter the bathroom, and into a stall i go.

it's always a tiring feeling just walking into a stall, settling my lunchpail on the floor and locking the stall. then i just stare at the stall barriers. probably take a picture of the toilet or two because i sneak my phone in most of the time. i always feel so tired of the same old shit because i feel and know it's impossible to change it. i've been through p.e. many times a year. sometimes i'd play sports with my friends in the past. but these years i've just been so fucking out of it i don't know where to start.

my friends would always go to the bathroom and say my name and be like, ""are you in there?"" like they already know i do this every day. i'm just scared to ask to play volleyball or whatever with them, like a way to get out of the shitty bathroom that i absolutely hate to love hiding in.",sports and socialization? yuck.

2022-11-10 13:32:07,depression,"well i don’t know why i’m typing this right now, but i guess i just needed an outlet for these thoughts that i’m having right now. but, life right now feels horrible. i hate my brain and i hate myself for being depressed. i would consider myself a pretty privileged person. i have everything i need and i have great people to surround myself with. i feel like i have absolutely no reason to be depressed, but here i am sitting in my room finding a reason to hate every single thing in my life. i have these depressing thoughts for a couple months and all of a sudden they go away and i’m fine for a little. but it keeps coming back, and i know that i will be happy again in due time, but i feel like my lows are getting lower and my highs are what i’m supposed to feel like if my brain just wasn’t so fucked. why is anything worth it if i know that my brain is just gonna fuck me over in a month or so and the happiness that i get is gonna fade away and i’m back in a deeper hole than before. every single time i fall back into this hole, i find 
myself slowly emotionally retracting from my friends and family. i can’t share with them my problems because i think that it’s stupid of me to feel this way in the first place, or that it’ll be such a shock that they won’t believe me. i’m a pretty personable person, i make friends easily and i have a lot of energy and i seem like an overall happy person who is confident with themselves. but, holy fuck am i hiding a very dark side of me that no one would really suspect. the side of me that thinks so gray about everything and the side of me that thinks about death as comforting.

suicide and death has been something i always think about, but when it comes down to it i don’t think i’ll ever have the guts to go through it. i’ve brainstormed every possible scenario of how i’d do it, but every single one ends up in me either going through a lot of pain or the possibility of me not actually dying and having to get checked into the psych ward. the thought of me getting admitted because of a failed suicide attempt sounds absolutely embarrassing and everyone will now know me as the person that tried to kill themselves that one time and i’ll have to be babysat for the rest of my life. instead, when i have these months of depression, i just hope every single second of my life that there will just be a random life-ending accident that’ll happen to me. something that’ll make everyone think that i was just perfectly fine and life just decided to take me out of nowhere. or maybe i’ll keep slowly falling down this hole up until suicide seems more promising than trying to climb up this hole.

i feel like i’m just really ungrateful for life and i’m this horrible and negative pessimistic person but at the same time i’m aware i have this depression that makes my ungratefulness valid. i’m sure life has many things to offer for many but i’m unable to realize the beauties of life, even though they are right beside me. it sucks because it’s not the fact that i don’t have great things around me, it’s because my brain is unable to comprehend that these things are great. i’ve tried antidepressants, but had my psychiatrist fuck up my meds and she never fixed them. called multiple times and sent emails but she never got back to me. figured it’s not worth it to keep badgering someone for meds that i was iffy about taking in the first place. so here i am posting this anonymously, open to hearing literally anything about what people have to say about my thoughts. i’m just tired of being ungrateful for life, not because i choose to be ungrateful but because i’m currently living with a tainted brain. what kind of life am i living if i’m just trying to get through the storm and i’m just continuously anticipating the next time life fucks me over? what kind of life is worth living where i can be surrounded by the best things ever, where i can obviously tell that these are good for me, but i can’t feel it. who knows if there will be something in life that’ll make me actually feel somewhat happy, but for now i’ll just keep on living with no reason to enjoy life.",i hate my brain

I’m just realizing after battling with depression for so many years that it won’t just go away. Even when your situation gets better it’s still there. Which makes me feel like an ungrateful brat. I thought my resilience growing up meant I could handle the stress of any struggles I may face as an adult. Now as an adult I’ve noticed that my depression has only gotten harder to face as I now take on more responsibilities. I try so hard to be “normal”, whatever that is. I want to be a productive member of society. I feel the pressure of being a first generation college student. I put a lot of pressure on myself because I know the stress my family has gone through with my oldest sister who to this day struggles with a substance use disorder. I don’t want to add more pain so I try hard to keep up with what I think adults should be doing and struggle to do that alone. Any stress throws me for a loop and feels catastrophic. In college I struggle with all of my classes and feel awful when colleagues at my internship try to hype me up and say I’m going to be successful. I feel like I’m going to let people down because I know I’m not doing as well as people assume I am. I know it comes from a good place but it hurts. I try to get help through therapy and medication but struggle to articulate how I feel when in therapy. The medications don’t help much. I keep telling myself I will return to therapy and see a psychiatrist but talk myself out of it telling myself it isn’t that bad, despite having incredibly distracting intrusive thoughts about how depressed I am. I used to self harm and haven’t done so in years but even that comes to mind as a release from all the stress. I don’t have an outlet considering my full time school schedule, homework, work, and a relationship that feels like it is struggling. It makes me so sad to see what my relationship has become. I feel bad for him for having to deal with my depression and how hard it is for me to keep up with housework. I just feel like a disappointment all around. I’ve noticed that I don’t have a lot of reasons to live I only have a lot of reasons not to die.

The story of my life is that I started playing guitar when I was 7, got REALLY good at it (there's not point in bluffing when I want constructive input, I'm at the advanced end of technique), I graduated school with honours and though I didn't think of myself as a social person, I did have quite the number of really good friends. My parents are the best I could ever hope for and my sister (24 y/o) is the person I trust the most in the world. I've never had a girlfriend, though from what friends tell me I'm supposedly quite sought after. I wouldn't know about that though as I never went to parties because I find them socially awkward unless I get drunk. I've flirted with some girls, had sex with one of them, but never felt like I needed doing it. In fact I thought of it as another chore. After the initial euphoria of being validated by a member of the opposite sex, I just wanted to block them and be done with it. The more I think about it, the less I understand romantic dynamics, they just seem so plain and banal, as if it all was just an identity check that unlocked sex. I don't even think sex is that good, I just jerk off to a video and get done with it. And no, I don't objectify women at all, I just can't possibly see the point of relationships when at most it's just a glorified friendship with sex thrown in the mix, not to say the absolute time and energy sink that comes along. 

I have absolutely zero issues dealing with people, in fact I'm extremely good at handling situations with strangers and most people who meet me will agree that I'm probably the best mannered person they'd encounter that day. However I find it really difficult to actually connect with people. I'm the kind that turns silence uncomfortable. I tend to think that when I'm not putting on that courteous attitude and actually try being myself around new people, I come across as unlikeable. 

Not that it matters to me anymore, since I moved in from my town to the big city where my sister lives to study in college. I've been here for 6 months and haven't really made any actual friend aside from the guy that I knew was trying to get on my good side just to ride my car. I see college as nothing more than the place where I go take lessons, shut up, and come back home from, I frankly don't have any interest in changing that as I don't feel like my day is long enough to throw social dynamics in the mix.

Those where my thoughts about the usual things, so now come the events leading up until now:

I've always thought that music is the most precious thing in my life, so I naturally wanted to study music when I got out of college. I could notice my parents weren't enthusiastic about it, but they said they would help me with anything that made me truly happy and that I absolutely didn't have to think about the money. Music is a difficult business in the US, so I won't even start on how damn hard it is in South America. That made me chose the safe option and try for electronical engineering as I like PCs and phones. They wanted me enrolled at a private college, but I insisted on applying a full government scholarship for the best university in the country, which I got. I always knew this wasn't what I had envisioned myself studying or doing with my life, but I told myself to stop being a spoiled child and brave it on like normal unprivileged people do. 

Two months into the semester and it all was crashing down around me. I had a big issue with an early physics asignment and had to carry that weight for the whole semester thinking I'd totally fail the class. I felt miserable and completely shocked at how low my performance was compared to school when I seemingly had less workload, a ton of things less to get distracted with and all around actually caring, unlike school where it all just came naturally to me. I couldn't unwind with anything I did, going to the gym felt like a wasted hour that I could've spent doing something college related, I was fucking anxious anytime I tried to watch TV or play some videogames, for which I've absolutely lost all appetite, because I'd feel like trash for not doing college related stuff. And when all that fear was getting me up to study, I didn't even want to study out of frustration about the material. I found myself craving for sensorial gratification, like drinking a Coke to do something or getting iced coffee after doing something, like I was rewarding myself. It spiraled out of control and I'm still drinking like a liter of Coke a day and spending almost 40 dollars a week in iced coffee. This, in turn, has me seeing regressions in my gym progress, which led me to food and drink guilt. I was so scared of going to classes that I had diarrhea before lessons every day. I felt absolutely hopeless and a complete failure as a person, all the while two of my best friends were in the capital studying music at the Berklee adjunt music school with scholarships they earned. I tried escaping my reality and applied for the same scholarship to go there. My parents were noticeably shaken by just how much I seemed to lose it, just two months in and throwing it all away to go to a city where I had nothing. I told them that if the scholarship was above 50%, I'd definitely do it. I really thought I was a better musician than my friends so I was actually hoping on it. I promised myself that whatever the outcome of that audition was, I was gonna pass all my engineering classes because I absolutely can't let myself fail at anything. I got a psychologist and we concluded that I was putting too much pressure on myself. Big deal, I knew that. The problem is that I'm completely incapable of getting over it and winding down.

Lo and behold, thinking I was going to leave anyway took the pressure off my shoulders and passed all my classes with really good grades in the tests. Turns out the music scholarship I was awarded was just 30%, and it completely knocked down the image I had of myself as a musician. I literally went to get a haircut down the block around my place and the barber turned out to be a violin and piano bachellor. I thought, my barber is a better musician than I am and he's trimming beards. I definitely put the music school stuff down and told myself the cards I was given were the ones of an engineer.

Semester ends and I go back emotionally to more or less the same as I was before college started, aside from the music school debacle. I thought that the experience of braving on through the adversity had prepared me for second semester. I'm two months in and while I objectively know I'm a better situation than I was at this point last semester, I fear the issues are coming closer and closer. I'm once more feeling incapable of thinking about anything but college, unable of anjoying anything  I do,  and even when I objectively have a good day, I feel fucking scared of something I don't even know what is. It's just a gut feeling that stalks you until you pay attention and then you can't stare away from it. 

I've been writing this for an hour and I feel I'm digressing, I don't even know what I want to expect of you guys anymore. I don't know if I know the answer or if I'm asking a question, so I'll just leave this big ass text here and hope someone can make head or tails out of it. If you want to comment anything about it or ask me something else I'll definitely reply back.","I don't really know what's going on with me, so I'll post a big text"
2022-11-10 11:44:23,depression,"I'm at my wits end. So sunken and torn in a world of helplessness and addiction. I went to rehab this year for drinking and dropped out after only 12 days. I've spent a week in a psych hospital this year and almost killed myself so many times within the past half year. I literally lost my mind and gave up on my life this year. It all started when I confessed to my Girlfriend of 7 years that I had cheated on her. She forgave me and we went about life but the guilt of what I had done was so immense I knew that I had to turn my life around so I started going to church in an attempt to rectify my life but all that made me do was become obsessed and terrified of divinity, judgement, and damnation. I also stopped having sex with my girlfriend because we ""weren't married"" and I would just feel so guilty. After a year of that I pretty much just gave up the thought of god and religion and because a nihilistic alcoholic and just like that I started to spiral back down a path towards the same shitty person that I was when I had cheated on her. 

I think I'm Bisexual. I've always had a fantasy about having sex with another guy, but only sex and out of lust, no kissing, holding hands, being in a relationship, none of that, just hooking up. I've bought secret dildos behind my girlfriends back and use them once and then throw them away because of the guilt. It's something that I just can't seem to shake. Like the thrill of getting away with it and fueling that fantasy is the only thing in my life that I look forward too. I think I'm just an addict. If I can't have alcohol I turn to sex or other drugs. I just feel so trapped and swollen with guilt. I'm a shitty coward person and don't know what to do. It's gone so far that I cheated on her again. Not physically, but messaging someone on sniffies for dick pics and then deleting my account. I think I should just end this relationship or end myself. She deserves so much better. My life is such a fucking mess right now and nobody knows and I go about life as normal but inside I just want to die. What should I do??",I'm a shitty person.

2022-11-10 11:24:35,depression,"I found triple-negative breast cancer in Jan 2019.  I went through chemotherapy and radiation.  All the usual happened; some things never went away (nausea) and others got triggered (blood issues and constant pain).  But hey, I survived right?

Yes, it has been over 3 years since my last radiation session and I am still ""cancer free"".  People assume I am so happy; that I am living life to the fullest and celebrating milestones of survivorship.

Instead I am lying in bed, curled in a little ball, writing this with tears making my sheets wet. Why?

Cancer is still taking things from me even now.  This time it's my teeth.  They don't focus on telling you how chemo wreaks havoc on your mouth and teeth.  They tell you all about freezing eggs and about triggering early menopause.  They tell you about reconstructive surgery for when your breasts are either scarred significantly or removed which insurance will cover.

But your teeth...nope, no lessons on how the permanent dry mouth changes the pH of your mouth.  No one says that no matter how much you watch out for your teeth, your calcium is leeched and the vomited stomach acid destroys your enamel.  No matter how much you brush and rinse after whatever you do, they are just screwed.

I have had an oral surgeon say I need full permanent dentures.  Yeah cuz a woman on basically no income, SMI designate and only medical insurance can certainly afford a luxury car's worth of cost in her mouth.  No, insurance doesn't cover it even if it's a byproduct of cancer. 

My regular dentist was supposed to be filling a growing cavity on my front tooth next week. But what is the point when the tooth that is supposed to get filled instead breaks, leaves you in pain bleeding as you are driving home after a long day?

I just don't know what to do anymore except cry.  I can't get assistance from any insurance.  I can't get help financially.  It all makes me feel like I just can't anymore and that you will NEVER beat cancer.  Even if it doesn't send you to an early grave, it will keep taking everything from you and there is no stopping it, ever.",Hopeless Crying; Still Destroying after 3 Years

2022-11-10 10:58:21,depression,"i first started cutting myself during quarantine. back then i didn't have access to a boxcutter so i used a needle. i grated that thing against me until it ripped away the skin and started tearing at my flesh. i did this three times and to this very day, those scars remain.

those scars attracted some attention but i was able to lie it off. soon after i got a boxcutter. i started cutting myself along my shoulders and thighs to hide the cuts cause i didnt want anybody to see them.  
i went clean for like half a month after school started up again but some time near the end of the first semester of my freshmen year, i cut myself again. i thought that id be able to go clean, finally, but the pressure broke me.  
eventually that pain started to fade away and this time, ive gone clean far longer than ever before, but i think its over. recently i managed to get together with a girl ive liked since my elementary years of school and i managed to hide this relationship for 4 weeks before my sister found out and blabbed to my parents. theres a reason why i dont like opening up to my family, theyre strict. and today that strictness managed to push me to the edge once again.

i just want to say that im a pretty good student. i average a-'s to a's but its never good enough. my parents care more about my future than they care about the current me. they for sure saw the cuts back during quarantine but they so easily accepted the lie that i just hurt myself while horsing around. no questioning, nothing. and even now. cant they just be happy that i have a girlfriend? cant they even applaud me for managing such a feat when im so socially inept? cant they be glad that im doing okay in school? cant they be proud of me for doing debate when i cant talk? cant they just be happy that im trying to change and finding happiness in life? 

why do you guys care about my future so much anyways? i know that my success in high school will determine my future but can you guys just calm the fuck down? im just trying to be happy. ive loved one girl my entire life and i finally managed to get together with her and now youre trying to tear us apart? all because i go to her races and go on dates with her? why should i spend all that time studying? i just want some freedom in how i live my life. i only have to wait 2 more years before im technically free from this hell hole.

im gonna cut myself to feel better. honestly, i dont even know if my self harm even counts as self harm. my cuts arent that close to vital areas and i really only cut to feel the pain and focus my thoughts elsewhere.  
i think im gonna cut my thighs, maybe under my watch strap, and most likely my palm  
thighs cause my underwear still covers that so even when im changing in gym, nobody will see  
watch strap cause i got an apple watch to deal with this bullshit. nobody even focuses on the scars on my wrist when you got some fucking expensive watch on your wrist---its perfect for my self harm

I’m just tired. I’m in a job that I hate, school is just killing me mentally, and I feel like I have no time to enjoy with my friends. 

I’ve been waiting for over a week to enjoy some time online with my friends by playing some games and just having a good time, buts if it’s not one thing, it’s another. My fiancée gets upset because she doesn’t like going to sleep alone, I get home too late from work, I have school assignments, and then the one time I do have time, I get to play for maybe five minutes and then my ISP has a total outage in my area and I honestly broke down in tears and my fiancée had to comfort me. I know it’s a dumb thing to get upset about but I just want to enjoy time to myself or with friends by just hanging out or playing games. 

I feel like I’ve been neglectful since I haven’t been able to give them as much time as I wanted to. One of my closest friends just recently got married and I was a groomsman, and honestly the month of the wedding was probably the most time I’ve spent with them in almost a year. Not just with friends, but with my family too. I hardly see my mom anymore and it honestly kills me. I’ve been trying to make time for them, but it’s hard because I feel like I have to spread myself so thin just to try and not feel neglectful anymore. 

To top it off, my job just absolutely doesn’t care about us no matter how much they say “frontline first” or whatever. Ever since the pandemic “ended”, I haven’t been able to take any meaningful time off, I can’t take a day for my mental health without being berated about getting someone to cover my shift, I’m constantly harassed by customers, and it’s gotten to the point where I’m crying as I get ready to go and as I’m driving there. 

I’m just so incredibly burnt out that I feel like I can’t enjoy anything anymore and it’s getting to the point where I’m considering an attempt on my own life again. The depression is constantly eating at me and I don’t know how to make this sinking feeling stop. I feel like I’m constantly drowning and there’s nothing in sight.",I just don’t know what to do
2022-11-09 15:14:46,depression," Hey,

My mother kept telling my father that I wasn't worth their money or time.

my parents have high expectations of me, This is because I had very high acceptance marks (SAT and AP). They want me to graduate with a high GPA in engineering in the shortest possible time, Even though they knew I was battling my depression/anxiety. I tried to explain to them that engineering is not like that and that my degree may take much longer (I don't know the ETA-for real who knows what the future holds :SMH: -).

So I proposed another solution: changing to a simpler major/subject and a simpler university. They replied that I am a huge disappointment to the family And that I should live on my own without them caring for me anymore.

By the way, I work hard to maintain a good GPA and meet their expectations, but last year I slept all day because I was depressed/anxious (btw they kept holding therapy and tuition costs over my head). As a result, I am at least a year behind my peers.

Now I don't feel I have the legibility to have balanced time/Enjoy my free time. I feel the urge to keep studying 24/7 as they did everything for me to succeed. Sometimes, I get so burnt out I start bingeing video games to numb myself (I feel a huge stress). What do you think about this? Am I an asshole?",my parents spoiling me only to study.

I’ve never felt so helpless. I’ve been in this position before but I was strong enough to get up and solve my problems. I’m just too emotionally exhausted to dig myself out of this one. And the really sick part is that I care most about losing the person I loved. In my twisted mind I would be able to do this if I had him beside me telling me I can do it and everything will be okay. I don’t blame him for leaving me, because I became terrible and wouldn’t even want to be with me if I was him. He’s a good person who treated me well and would’ve done anything for me.

I mean i'm still gonna be depressed and anxious and ocd and whatever else, there's only so much i could do about that if i wanted. Besides, i've been like this for a while.

2022-11-09 14:42:32,depression,"So it is a long story, and I'm sorry about that I just really need to rant.
 So idk how to start but I have a lot of mental issues. I have ptsd, depression, anxiety, bipolar. I have more but those bother me the most. So I am young I'm 18, but I am so lost and on the edge. My brain is everywhere after everything that has happened in the last few months. So my life has always been full of mental problems, but I can usually deal with it because it is just some small things or just 1 thing that is truly bothering me, but this time it's worse. So I was with this girl and everything was literally perfect. Things could not have been better. We were in love and doing great. Then everything changed after we graduated. We could not see each other nearly as much. So we were both working full time. So not being able to see her sucked but I could deal with it we powered through it. Then we both started college. That made things infinitely worse. I started rough but it was okay. So we were in school, and so ofc we could still barely see each other. So I got super fucking depressed because my mom is dealing with post partum depression because she just had a baby so that was getting to me, doing almost nothing but working or school was getting to me, and not being able to see her hurt me as well. So we started having a lot of issues. We argued more than we ever had. Then the dumbest shit started with her. So if she had a bad day we would call or text and talk about it. I would walk her through it and would help her with the shit that was bothering her. And giving her other things to focus her mind on. But when I had a bad day or was having a bad time. She practically ignored me. She would just say ""oh it's okay. Oh it will be okay Aden"" ""It is always okay"". She cared so little for me mentally that it was crazy. So we argue and talk and what not then we break up. Within a few days she begs for me back and I take her back. It goes well then a week or 2 later she left me again. I said okay and was going to get back on medication, and back into therapy so I was just gonna figure it out. She does the same shit and begs for me back comes over to my house at 2 in the morning hyperventilating, and can barely talk. And when she does finally talk she tells me that she loves me and will do anything to keep me. So we get back together. Things are yet again great. Then one day she wasn't having a great day and got kind of dry with me, but I was just like well shit happens. So after about 3 days I ask her about it and say I don't like her not talking to me about what is wrong. Long story short after a like 2 day argument. We break up again. This time it was for real. But we were still friends and cool. She still came over and what not so we basically acted like a couple just without saying it. Then one day she texts me and says she wants to come over. So she does. We chill, have sex, and just talk. She cries telling me she loves me and that she just wants me to be better. And that she is happy alone but would be way happier with me. So after chilling for a bit she goes home. So the next day we are talking. And she tells me she is hanging out with one of her guy friends. I was cool with it I knew about him so I didn't care. Bit she didn't tell me anything off rip she just told me that she was hanging out with someone. She ignored my questions and said because we aren't together she doesn't have to tell me anything. But. There were 3 questions and they were fair and simple. Where she was going. Who she was with. Then after just tell me how it went. That is it. So after all that she goes and hangs out with him and his friends. Girls and guys. She at the end said she was going home, and was close to her house. So an hour later I text her like her you should be home what are you doing and where are you. Yk are you okay what's up. She says she is finally in tville. So I was like okay what happened. Then she just gets home and tells me I acted irrationally and that she couldn't do it. And that she didn't want to be friends. And now her and that guy are together. Idk what else to say.

The pay is great for what I do, my Supervisor is so caring and laid back, and best of all I get to work from home which has been great for my introverted self. 

Yesterday about 300 other people within the company and I were told that we will be laid off at the end of November due to rising costs and inflation and shit. It was just so sudden—and although I am grateful for the severance package they are providing (about 3 months of pay) and that I wasn’t let go immediately, I’ve felt so much panic, confusion, anxiety, and depression. 

I know other people have been fired and laid off multiple times and got through it. I just feel so weak and have been crying profusely or feeling completely numb—I’ve been going back and forth waiting for more random tears to just hit me out of no where.

My partner and I live together and only have one car that we share (can’t afford another right now) and so I either have work out a driving schedule with him or get another job working from home, which has given me even more anxiety and hopelessness. 

I don’t know, I’m mainly just venting because I don’t want to keep trauma dumping on my partner and if anyone could give some advice, words or encouragement, or success stories that would be lovely. I’ve already applied to 4 places and haven’t heard anything back yet and I can’t focus and haven’t been eating or sleeping.

I feel like my brain isn't in control. I feel like someone else, sort of. Like, disconnected from my usual thought processes and ways of feeling better, because everytime I try something that used to make me feel better, it makes me feel nothing or worse.

I met with a friend for lunch today and that was fun and nice, but I left and when I was by myself it was back to nothing. I'm meeting with another friend on Thursday.

Work is miserable, and not just because I've started hating my job. I hate being there, even though the being around people makes me feel better and distracted from my negative temptations, temptations I've never had and given into to the degree that I have in the past few days. I feel like someone else, and my behavior is different. It's awful. I want it to stop.

Hanging out with my family tonight was alright, better than it normally makes me feel. Then I came to my room and it's just awful. I dont understand this. I don't get it.

I'm a boring person. I had hobbies like drawing but now it feels like a chore. i have not drawn anything for a year or so.
I do not have any interest in anything. I don't like sports. I do like manga/anime but it's been 5-6 months since I consumed this type of content. I don't like to do anything and I don't know why i wasn't like this before.
I sometimes look okay and sometimes so hideous I don't even look at myself. I have premature ejaculation and i feel nothing when i orgasm. I've been feeling nothing for quiet long now. The only thing i have the slightest interest is in listening songs/musics.

2022-11-09 12:47:46,depression,"I've been reflecting a lot on my years of college and what lies ahead and it had gotten me depressed.

I'm in a particular situation because I'm graduating late from a program I'm in. I've seen almost all of my friends, whom I have been with for years, graduate and move on with their lives. I never thought the day would come but it did. And I'm still here. I used to go out to the bars and go on these adventures every weekend, but that doesn't happen now. All the friends I have left have settled down and, although I do appreciate being in their company, are more prone to staying in, getting high, and going to bed early. Even though I'm still in college, things aren't the same anymore as they have been the past couple of years.

Hell, I even miss my last girlfriend as we were really close as friends before and in a relationship. But we strayed away after we broke up despite all my attempts to salvage any form of friendship. It makes me sad and a lot of times I ponder what could've happened if things have happened differently. She's graduating in a month and we haven't talked in a year. I have more or less moved on as I have been seeing other people, but it's weird having that thought coming into my mind that in a month, this woman who has had a tremendous impact on my life will be moving away and I'll never speak to or see her again.

There's other stuff like financial responsibility and job searching. Even though it does stress me out, I know things will fall into place soon in the end. 

Typically, I have a bright mood on through the day. I still enjoy just sitting in class and doing whatever I do on the weekends. But late at the night, and especially when I'm drunk, I almost get rid of this ""facade"" and reveal how I'm really feeling. I'm sad. I think it's more a mentality issue than anything I can physically do as it's inevitable. But it's daunting to face, at least for me.

I just wish I did more in college. Obviously, the pandemic hit some years ago and still lingers so that hindered a lot of things. But I wish I could run it all again and change what I have done. But then again, would I have learned the same lessons I have learned now?",Depression about college ending and becoming an adult.

Sure, there are a few people I talk with occasionally, but it’s all very base level and we never interact outside of school. The worst part is that everyone else in band is in a friend group.

While we’re sitting in the bleachers watching other bands at competitions, I don’t have anyone to watch them with.

sh and mentions of suicidal thoughts ⚠️ 
Hey, So I have a problem. Let’s start from the beginning. Im a F15 and I have let’s just say I have  strict parents. They are both Christian both homophobic and also racist and my dad is locally “famous”. So basically I struggle with a lot of issues like self harm suicidal thoughts (which can get pretty heavy) and anxiety, depression, social anxiety, not having any idea who I am and just not having a sense of self. But here’s my problem I’ve been telling my parents for a long time that I have been cutting myself and had some suicidal thoughts. But i was usually just told “think positive thoughts” or “it’s ok sweetie” stuff like that. Also I should probably add that school is extremely mentally draining for me and going to school will either end in me crying in the bathroom or just leaving early faking a stomach cramp (even tho I actually have consistent stomach pains) just to get out of school because my parents don’t understand at all. They also don’t seem to listen, and they seem to think that changing schools to a private Christian school is going to fix all my problems. After I told them I no longer believe in god or what the bible teaches. I also have a lot of trauma from my dad just being an asshole. I’ve been screamed at and I mean screamed at for my French grade in grade 9 I only got a c-. He told me I basically failed and how I “lied” to him after all I did was suggest that maybe me not handing in this certain thing could have brought my grade down, I even had to sit on a plane with him for 5 hours afterwards. Another thing he’s done is I was not aloud to close my door for about 4 months unless I was getting changed. (Shocked he didn’t take the door off the hinges) but the thing with the punishment is, is that I didn’t do anything to get the punishment in the first place there was no reason for him not to trust me. I’ve never drank alcohol, hung out with boys, smoked, vaped, snuck out, I haven’t even kissed someone for god sake. Yet he still won’t trust me. I’m not even aloud an ounce of social media. But my point is, is that I need some advice on how to communicate to my parents that they are the problem (even tho they pretty well know already) and get them to actually understand that I have a mental illness and that this is something they need to understand and take seriously without them being overly worried and making me feel guilty for telling them this and how they make it feel like it’s all my fault and that I should feel bad for feeling this way. As well as saying things like “where did my little girl go” or “what’s happening to u”. I just need to know what to tell them because I don’t want them up my ass asking if I’m anxious over homework. Because don’t get me wrong homework doesn’t help but that’s not why I’m depressed and I don’t always have to have a reason for being depressed. As well as getting them to understand that being up stairs (instead of in my room in the basement)(my safe place) is not a great place for me to be because it’s loud and my whole families up there my dad my mom and my 3 sisters, and I go there almost all hours of the day to get away from them. Lots of people like to blame my parents behaviour on there age because my dad is 58 and my mom is 50 so they aren’t young especially since they have 9 year old twin daughters. But my point is (I’m sorry for rambling I’m getting there) I need someone to tell me how I’m supposed to talk to them without A. them being on my ass about school and me changing schools and B.  having them worry and make me feel guilty about it.

Stop talking about how annoying it is to have a period I don’t fucking care I’m not your doctor, stop talking about your kids or your placenta or your fucking childbirth induced incontinence holy fuck. 

Individual female humans, fine. Get a bunch of women in a group, what the hell. Is this why I never fit in, no matter where I go? It's the same every time. I can pretend, and I'm good enough at pretending that I can get favourable outcomes from networking events or whatever, and I can get women to like me. But on a personal level I can’t deal with that shit. If someone pursues a deeper relationship with me, based on this fake shit, what choice do I really have but to avoid them?

Is everyone else pretending as well? Are they better at it than me, or do they really, actually, get something out of this horrible fake socialisation. I wish the social group ""women"" ceased to exist, and I wish people would stop associating me with that group just cause of how I look.

This is really the first time I'm being honest with myself that this is the actual problem.",I'm drunk and this is a rant

2022-11-09 11:14:45,depression,I'm 23 and I have no friends or family. Lost my girlfriend this year and all of my friends. They sort of never truly cared and liked the idea of me then left when they realized how strange I am. I don't even have people to call on the phone. I need someone,I don't have friends or family.
2022-11-08 16:53:58,depression,"Hi, so I've been having this problem lately, it's been more than a month, when I have literally 0 energy to do things. I live with my partner whom I love veryvery much and I enjoy being WITH THEM, AT HOME, I would spend hours just cuddling them not doing anything else. Wr used to play games together every night bur now I don't really feel like I want to play those games, I'd rather sit and watch them and do nothing. But that's all fine, the problem is my university. It started in October and now it's 8th of November and I showed up like twice. I was always the person to be there every single day, never miss a class, never miss a project, but now I'm slowly fallling behind with everything, there are projects piling up and unattended classes that will make a problem for me at the end of the semestar, but I act like I don't care. I just don't have the energy to actually wake up and go to that building. Every morning I wake up and decide I can't get up physically and then I fall asleep again and a few hours later I feel like crying and I feel so bad for doing that and that happens every day. I don't even really go out that much, it's only with my partner and their friends from time ro rime and Ive realised that my partner has to beg me so I could just go out for a 5min walk. I don't have the energy for that.

But I'm acting normal and carefree and happy for the rest of the time? It's just that I lack energy and motivacioni and will to do anything else than sleep, sit around and be around my partner.

It's important to note also that I moved away last year from my mentally abusive parents and some of these days is the anniversary of me moving out so I feel like it's affecting me without me realising. I'm often thinking of things that happened last year at this time and I don't feel well. I just want to get out of this and start foing things again. I've never been so behind in life and I hate it.",Is this some sort of a depressive episode?

I'm so exhausted of the day to day drivel. A husband that fucking hates me, a job I don't care about but simultaneously am fighting for my life to do ENOUGH for while still failing at basic tasks, a house in shambles, damp on the walls, a family falling apart needing me for everything and one friendship hanging in the balance cause I don't have energy to support them.

2022-11-08 16:45:05,depression,"I thought how I felt in high school was gonna be the worst of the worst for me. Things were going good. I got a new job I actually enjoy, my partner and I moved into a one bedroom instead of a studio, I’ve recently been making big steps to finally being myself and who I want to be. 

Then the simplest thing happened.. I realized this month marked an entire year without sex. For some reason it sent me into a downward spiral and I’ve never in my life felt like how I do now. My body is so heavy, I don’t want to eat, I don’t want to get up, I can barely type this. 

It’s like I have butterflies in my throat instead of my stomach, but I don’t feel excited I feel extreme sadness. This feeling come ins continuous waves and radiates into my limbs. 

My partner is asexual, we didn’t know this until last year. Once they came to that conclusion all form of intimacy stopped. They say there’s nothing wrong with me and that they still love me but it’s hard to feel loved when you’re not wanted or desired. 

I haven’t been able to masturbate without crying for a few months now. It’s sounds extremely pathetic but after I get the same extreme sadness feeling.

My mom took care of me and made sure I was alright. I laughed, played with friends, went out and did things with my mom, everything was exciting and fun. No adult worries or stress. No responsibility. Now I’m an adult who can barely function, with crushing responsibilities and people who are supposed to rely on me. But I wish I could go back. I don’t want to have panic attacks anymore, I want my happiness to come back, I don’t want to worry about things I shouldn’t be worried about. I want my mom. I want my old house. I want bedroom. I want to go hang out with my friends at school. I just don’t want to feel like this anymore. I just want to be happy and enjoy life.",I wish I could be a kid again

2022-11-08 16:39:44,depression,"I don't know from where should I start but okay. So my father and mother had an arranged marriage and my mother came from a decent and well-mannered family and so she was very naive and polite. My dad was totally the opposite and used to hit her and what not. My brother (6 years older) and I used to watch it and till now I find it traumatizing. 

My dad also used to hit my brother and he never had any respect for any of us. He would occasionally smile at me or say some fake nice sentence which my brother found very triggering and said that father loves me more. 

As I grew up, my brother got terrible anger issues too, due to the family atmosphere, and my father and him had huge physical fights where they hit each other a lot. My brother ended up beating up my mother and I too for around 2 years before he went to college. I used to lock myself up to not get hit. There were 2 instances where he accidentally or idk hit my mom on the head and she was bleeding like anything. At that time I was in 6th or 7th and ran like hell in the house to apply medicine. The next day I cried and went to my father to see mom's head and lied that she got hit by the cooler (because there was a need of an injection to be applied). 

After my brother went to college, no one talked to one another in the house, my mom got invested in my paternal grandmother who only used mom and never appreciated her. I was in class 9 when grandmother died. But till then, my mother's back had severe pain and problems. All this time, I was going through bullying at my school but I never felt like sharing anything. After class 8th, my grades felt and my world shattered because books were what kept me alive. I was going through severe anemia but managed to get my grades up and get back on track. Took science in class 11 and hardly managed to pass but my dad refused to pay for the tuitions since I refused to join coaching classes for competitive exams (he is a physics professor at one of these centres). 

Got through these 2 years and then lockdown came. My brother came back and the fights came back. My brother had minimized hitting my mom since he felt guilty but still had those 1 or 2 instances. He still used to hit me because I used to stop him from smoking cigarettes (only because he and I have had asthma and his was severe) or stop him from fighting just so that no injuries happen. I wanted to prepare myself for other entrances but due to the fights and getting hit and being called a prostitute by my own brother on a regular basis, it all got to me. When I tried to reach out to my brother and used to get emotional and cry, he used to slap me for crying because he thought it was weak. 

Once the fight got so insane (one day before the most imp entrance exam) that my maternal aunt had to come and take my brother away. He then spent 3 months at her home, working on himself. That's fine and I was glad but somewhere or the other, I always felt neglected. I never got a chance to work on myself in a calm environment. 

Anyway, so I never had any relationship as such with my brother. Obviously, never with my father too. I am the closest to my mom but I am still never able to convey my problems to her since she is disturbed too and she never deserved all of this. My brother regrets everything he's done and apologizes to mom now (not to me). On the contrary, my brother is gentle on the inside and does good things too but I am not able to take all of these memories out, I have constant breakdowns in front of mom since I am now trying to prepare for the most important entrance exam (while being in the last year of college). I am not in the correct mental state and am not able to focus at all. Verbal fights still take place between mom and dad and I can't help but listen to all of it regularly. My dad says things like if you don't change the light bulb it'll be my shoe and your face (though he never hit me) but it is still very disturbing. 

My dad also tortured my brother from the start like hit him and never give him enough money for his expenses, never talk to him nicely and always be the fucking toxic person ever. No one can be blamed and no one can be called right. But all this has ruined me so much. And oh yeah plus the 2.5 years of toxic relationship I had wherein I was made to question my worth on a regular basis. My friends have never been permanent but now I'm used to it. 

My main problem is that I'm not able to prepare nicely for the exam or focus on anything.",venting/stuck/lost/done with life

I wish there was some reason my friends never talk to me. I'm so pitifully alone. I overthink every social situation and yet somehow I still manage to fail all of them. I'm just kinda there, trying to not make anyone upset. And yet, I still make people upset, all the time. I try so damn hard to be normal and I just can't do it. But I'm also not weird enough to find some small group of people to be friends with. And now suddenly everyone's in a relationship around me and nobody's liked me for over a year when I had a girlfriend, who is now in another relationship. Every day I see all the couples and just can't help but feel worse than I already do. I'm acing all my classes, I don't think I'm super ugly, and I try every day to be better and yet none of it fucking matters. I'm 18 now. My childhood is over and I have nothing to look forward to. I'm so scared I'm going to be alone forever. I'm so scared nobody will ever care. I'm so scared I'll be lying in my deathbed and nobody will be next to me.

Long story tried to make short while starting at the beginning - When I was in middle school a lot of the school threats and what not started happening a lot more frequently,  I forced my mom to pull me out of in person school and put me in an online only school because I would have breakdowns and anxiety attacks everyday due to what was happening. It started off pretty well but some things happened and I fell into a depressive state quite quickly, stopped doing my school, and honestly just let myself rot away in my room for the 3 out of the 5 years it’s been. I told myself I wouldn’t make it past 18 and that doing those things didn’t matter anymore since I didn’t plan on being here. Fast forward to now I’ve realized that I want a future of some sort and im left picking up the pieces that past me tore apart, and one of the main things I think I tear myself apart and am angry about is what I’ve done to my academic career, I’m suppose to be graduating next year but I have not finished 8th grade. My parents have no clue about what was happening or that I’m so far behind, and telling them would honestly get me kicked out which I don’t want to do so I can’t really get support or advice on what to do from them. Again, please let me know if I need to delete this and it’s not allowed. I guess my question is kind of if anybody else has done this and what did they did to fix it. I’m thinking I can get my GED but I’m not sure what level of education you need to have prior to going to those classes. I definitely want to help myself but I don’t know where to start and it’s making my brain go haywire. I don’t want pity or anything but general advice on where to start.

2022-11-08 15:35:34,depression,"

ahhhh i don’t even know where to begin. This is a long one and I’ve been holding it in for almost my whole life, so I apologize if it’s too much. I just need to dump some stuff.

When I was young, I was forced into sports. It wasn’t bad at all in the beginning, I only played recreational sports and yeah it was fun because of the snacks you’d get, the cool team names and uniforms you’d get, etc. My parents soon realized I was talented at being a goalkeeper, so they pushed me into competitive soccer aka club soccer. They dedicated 8 long years putting me through conditioning, training, and so much more to achieve professionalism. As I got older, I got more attention, but my satisfaction with the sport was going down. I’d have to endure mental abuse,sometimes physical abuse, from my father if I made any mistakes or showed any emotion after my team lost. 

I would throw tantrums of not wanting to go to practice or games, but in the end I had to go because my parents would threaten to call the coach and humiliate me. I’d cry during practice in secret and wipe my tears with my dirty gloves. Nobody would notice anyways since we practiced in the dark. Sometimes I’d cry in the car after a game after my parents told me how my teammate’s parents shit talked me during the game as if that’d help motivate me.

During those 8 years of me playing,  I realized now that it ruined my social skills and more. I’d never be able to connect with my teammates. I was described as the lone wolf by my coaches because of how awkward and unsocial able I was, which led to more berates from my parents since they accused me of having autism or whatever. Everyone in my team never wanted to associate with me and only talked to me if they were forced to or for teamwork stuff ig. I remember being invited by my friends from school to birthday parties, hang outs, etc. but always having to say no because of my dad. My dad only expected me to give my all to soccer since friends are a distraction, according to him. 

Like I said earlier, I got attraction and eventually did get to the point of almost achieving fame, stardom, and becoming a pro soccer player. Everyone was so proud of me. Everyone saw 15 year old me as a role model of working hard even if they didn’t know the abuse and mental anguish I went through to get where I was now. I was so happy knowing my parents would finally be proud of something I did. 

Until I got cut. My life tumbled down from there despite being only 15. I was called a failure, a loser, weak minded, and lazy for not becoming a pro and getting cut. I’m still reminded by them to this day that I could have been pro if I wasn’t depressed or lazy. 

After I culminated middle school, I moved to a new county, so I started high school with no friends and it fucking sucked. I failed my first class and fell into a deeper depression as the days went by. I turned to social media for attention since I was deprived from any love since I felt like my parents hated me and nobody considered me girlfriend material since I was considered ugly back then (still am and I was ugly). I ended up getting groomed by multiple older men and they managed to get inappropriate pictures of 15 year old me. To this day it haunts me how they were able to do that so easily and how fucking stupid I was to do that. I was still playing soccer at the time and that was my escape reality, albeit being unhealthy. 

I quit two years after I was cut from everything that would have guaranteed my parent’s love and praise. Now I had nothing to do with my life. I only did soccer and was never allowed to pursue other interests because my father only wanted me to do 100% with my life. I once again fell into depression doing nothing with my life and only playing video games till 5 a.m. and doing schoolwork.

And I attempted suicide. I attempted it 3 times in the same year. When my parents found out the first time, they were crying and I genuinely thought they finally cared about me. I got sent to a crisis center and once I got picked up, my mom told me that my father was arguing with her saying how he has a fucking weakass daughter and he hated me. The second time I attempted was in secret, it didn’t work obviously. The third time, I attempted and then told my dad I wanted to go to a crisis center for my safety. And he snapped. He slammed into my room, grabbed the hood of my hoodie and dragged me downstairs , basically choking me and threw me on the couch and start yelling how I’m fucking weak and don’t deserve anything for being a pussy. I remember crying so much after I gotten hit and my dad came in my room apologizing as if he didn’t beat me earlier. 


Time skip to me in senior year, it was awful . Although life did pick up since I finally got with my long term crush, it got awful towards the middle-last half of senior year.

I could tell his friends hated me. They’d call me controlling when they asked my bf to hang out with them and he wouldn’t want to go in general. They called me a bitch and horrible things. The way they looked at me during lunch held so much animosity. And it made me cry nearly every lunch wondering why no one liked me.

After I graduated high school, I was so happy to start a new chapter as my bf and I are going to the same university, all the toxic people were cut off, and my parents simply ignored me and never caused issues with me as much like before. 


And now I’m here, about to fail my first semester of university because of my depression. I truly tried so hard, but I can’t do it anymore. I haven’t been to class for about a month and I want to drop out. 

The thing is I know the inevitable consequences once I tell my parents that I’m planning to drop out. Another year(s?) of getting everything taken away from me like my car, social life, pc, and phone because my dumbass can’t get out of bed without crying or feeling anxious. I know they will hate me and call me a failure for dropping out and I will never gain the love of my parents, just as I was barely starting to gain their affection. I feel like a failure to my boyfriend as well and knowing that he’s seeing me go through turmoil rn hurts as well.

I'm worried the doctor will laugh at me and tell me it's in my head. I started EMDR therapy a few months ago for childhood bullying, but she has not diagnosed me with anything even though she is also a clinical psychologist. Should I ask her too?

Although I feel I've been somewhat low since I was 13, it's gotten worse since 2018. And worse again since 2021. I had a good few stressful years but the last year has been good and  it's my worst year.

Here's my symptoms: tired, fatigued, exhausted all the time, angry and irritable, impatient (never used to be), terrible sleep (falling asleep early and waking at 2am for hours), don't leave the house unless I have to or with husband, don't like going to bed alone, no hobbies anymore - no gym, no reading or listening to music, forget things all the time, can't watch a movie because I can't focus, work is slipping (WFH since 2016), dread spending days alone with my toddler because its so tiring, I love her of course but it feels very dulled down, bored with life, no strong emotions, my empathy for other people seems to be gone, no real happiness. 

I'm sure there is more but I'm worried that my gp will not entertain the thought of me being depressed because I get up everyday and do what has to be done (nothing more), and I'm not in bed all day or not crying all the time(I used to many years ago).",I think I'm depressed but also not sure...

2022-11-08 15:01:30,depression,"Heya, so I have been on Wellbutrin for about a year but have recently added celexa to the mix to help a little bit more as the Wellbutrin was not enough. One of the things that was causing a lot of problems for me was my sexual performance. I was finishing way too fast for my significant other to be finishing the way I wanted them too. While this wasn't a problem for our relationship, it certainly affected my confidence and desire to engage in sex. 

When I started on celexa at 10mg, I found that this problem went away and that I was taking a lot longer to finish and sometimes unable to finish at all. While this was not the solve I was hoping for, it was a step in the right direction and i was okay not finishing so long as my spouse was. Now, after about a month on 10mg celexa, this problem has seemingly gone away; although, I find it happening once and a while, but then other times it's back to finishing fast. Has anyone had this issue where they only have the sexual side effects some times? I find it strange that it isn't a consistent thing and it is a bit worry some that I haven't noticed the issue in a few days now. 

I do have some anxiety issues about finishing early that often tend to be self fulfilling. But I don't understand the side effects going away like they have. I was warned that it isn't one that often leaves and I kind of want those side effects of lasting longer to come back. I know that sounds really dumb, but it was really doing wonders for my confidence.",Celexa/citalopram sexual side effects questions

2022-11-08 13:45:11,depression,"Life feels like constantly turning wheel that never alters it's course and is only accelerating to a breaking point. I am 15 years old. A year or so ago, I was the happiest I have ever been in my life. I felt emotion all the time, even if I didn't realise it then. Something changed in my mind one year ago circa this month and now I can't feel happiness at all. Negative emotions more vibrant, but still they dwell behind a thick pedestrian veil that occludes almost all meaning. 

I want to die. Not kill myself, at this point if given the opportunity I would not be able to. I want merely to stop existing or never have existed. I don't want anyone to remember me. All I do is worry my parents and friends and I don't want them to experience any kind of the same pain I feel. 

I recently cut myself for the first time. The cuts weren't very deep because used a fairly dull knife. I had to saw  my arm back and forth hard multiple times to get a good cut. I hated the feeling of sawing into myself but I felt significantly better afterward. Afterward I felt better, the pain produces endorphins from what I hear, definately not happy though.

Through that ephemeral reprieve of complete monotony came rational clarity. I was angry at myself for cutting and was frankly offended that I had stopped to that level. However that way of thinking is gone and I want to do it again soon.

Through introspection, I have realised why I cut myself in the first place. Not only was it to feel something, but I wanted someone to notice my problem. My parents are very much in denial about the whole thing, and though I am wearing exclusively long sleeve shirts right now I actually hope somebody sees my cuts (as idiotic as that sounds).

The doctor wants me to take meds. I declined, so she told me to make an effort to spend more time with my friends. Even so, when I'm out with them almost every day now, I look in on myself and realise I am feeling neutral at best and almost in tears at worst.

Almost every day, at any minor inconvenience I'll somehow blow up at it. I don't want to be mean, and I try to hold it in as much as possible. For context I've always had anger issues since I was little, I thought I've been getting better but now I think otherwise. I'm the youngest, so I'm viewed as the favorite who's life is perfect but that couldn't be further from the truth. I understand that I got away with murder when I was little but that hasn't been the case for years. Now, nobody in my family takes me seriously, and its driving me insane because my emotions mean nothing to them. It's my fault too, because over the years I've built up this character whos tough and always happy. I'm always alone, the person nobody wants to talk to. Frankly, I don't blame them. I'm not funny even though I like to think I am, I never have any good storys, I'm overall miserable to be around, and despite the fact that I love my parents, I'm never any help at all. I have gotten everything my siblings haven't and yet I'm still depressed. What the fuck is wrong with me. Istg if I had a nickel for every time I thought about killing myself. The only reason I haven't done it yet is because there might still be people that care. If I die, I don't want my family to think it's their fault. Sometimes I'll stare off into space and suddenly the day is gone, everything that I had to do, just melts away. I'm constantly anxious about the future but then constantly regret the past, because I never stop to live in the present. And every time I do something even slightly wrong, my mind will become so cripplingly loud and yell the most hurtful things towards me, and then it pictures me being vividly stabbed. I just feel like everybody I know hates me and their not wrong to feel that way. I just want to throw a big tantrum like a small child, I want to yell and scream and kick. Not directed at anyone but, it's just leaking out in small bursts at the worst time. If this is normal, then how the hell does everybody live like this?--sorry for the rant btw I'm a little new to reddit

I have a kid of my own now who’s 13 and it kills me she’ll never know her grandmother. Her grandfather, my dad, is a mess.

Making 20/hr in a climate that’s unstable(California) &amp; worst of all I’m sick of talking to people I know because they don’t want me to complain about money problems.

I also don’t want to work because I will never be able to afford a place to live out here. I’m just saving money for… what? It’s debt value?

2022-11-08 12:53:34,depression,"The (large) body paragraph of this post was influenced by a discussion I was having in a friends group-chat I'm in during a conversation where recent dating experiences came up. The text itself isn't really formatted and pretty informal but I feel like it encapsulates the tone and emotion I was feeling at the time so I'm going to keep it as is:

 

&gt; i guess were posting these tn so while were on topic i almost finally got back into a relationship this summer like this chick was beautiful and she literally was always down to meet up and we would go shopping and literally had so much fun and chemistry, this was up in northern michigan and there's a lot of scenic places to go there so it was like literally something out of a movie, i remember specifically going to this beach on Lake Michigan w clear water and literally just having the greatest fucking time ever im not gonna go too in detail but it was a lot of fun. we watched the sun set and shit and it was literally the happiest ive prob been in the last maybe 2-3 years definitely since i dropped out of college. anyways the end to this is that I had to leave northern mich to go back to Florida and I promised her I'd try to make it work and see her again and the guilt just kinda built up and we grew apart gradually since long distance  can have the tendency of doing that especially when you haven't known each other that long... the story basically ends with her telling me how she was crazy in love at first and that it gradually faded away because of the circumstance and that it'd be better off as a memory, and ever since i tried to hit her up (maybe once or twice) she either responded dry or left me on read. All that shit was for nothing. it's one of the many things that weighs down my conscious every day, influencing the narrative that i will never be happy, and that i will get what i deserve in the end, even if those thoughts are irrational in nature. it fucking sucks. it's one of the many things that i can't get over, ive literally had dreams of those moments; of when the world felt a little bit bigger than it had before just because I was there, and she cared, she wouldve gone on a whim to see me and I would've done the same. i know that I'm young (20) and all that jazz but sometimes it just feels like i quite literally missed my chances and opportunities in life. it feels like a sick fucking joke, all of this.


I never really intended to make the text that long, but as I progressed into the story all of it just kind of poured out and it made me pretty emotional. Stories like this are what kind of influence my consistent, repetitive state of dysfunction. I'm 20, college dropout, about to pick up a second job because I can barely afford my apartment. I'm fucking alone whenever I'm not putting on a smile at work or at the gym (sorry, I am unfortunately a 'gymbro' lol). I guess it just feels like my time has past already; considering my age, it's a dumb thought. I go to work, maybe see some people I like at the gym, go home, and do what? Nothing. I try to go out, make plans, try to get out of the house, but it's to the point where I'm just a vaguely known acquaintance to everybody anymore, I'd be lucky to even get a response. 

I'm getting to a point where I just don't see why I should do it anymore, I feel like my life's at a dead end, my family was torn apart long ago...nasty divorce and all that but I'll spare the details, I have loved ones, but haven't heard from many of them, at least I can say I have them? That's more than some people can. 

I feel like a passenger in my own body, who would care if I died, or ceased, or anything of the sort? My immediate family I presume, and that thought hurts, but is it not in the human spirit to move on? To heal from grief? My memory would die with them, maybe my siblings as well. But eventually I would become no more significant than the grass that covers the ground or the asphalt and pavement that stretches a city street. 


I could go on and on, if I explained all my grievances this post would be long enough to fill a book. It feels a little comforting to pour my heart into something at least, even if it's not in a therapist/psych office, or even with anybody I know haha. It's November 7th, 2022 and, as of right now, Im still here. Dealing with the bullshit, trying to find a gem in a world that feels like it's fading of its color every single day.

2022-11-08 12:33:06,depression,"Hoping for some sort of help here, or maybe someone who has experienced the same.

So a little bit of a background story here. I’m 23 years old, and i suffer from what i think to be as anxiety, stringing from a couple years of alcohol abuse, and having my body shut down on me in June of last year. Now when i say drinking, i was drinking about 20 beers or so minimum, every night since i was about 17 or so, up until 22. I had a day leaving for work in the morning, where i picked up my co worker, and i had some sort of health attack where i had to pull over, i basically fainted, had some severe heart palpitations, and had this feeling of nausea and dizziness in me. Every day since then, i’ve had this feeling, and this scared feeling in my stomach that this is gunna happen again. I went to the hospital a few weeks after cause after i quit drinking cold turkey, i was going through crazy bad withdrawals. Ie, laying on the bathroom floor shaking, constant nausea, faintness, weakness, etc. Its never ending now. Its been over a year and a half now of this, and i went to a consoler, and it just didn’t workout well, especially over the phone. i was prescribed pills &amp; didn’t want to take them due to side effects, i also have never been a fan of medicating. Now, i went a few months without drinking and it was way worse, to this day, i still get it bad, but some days i can push through and others i can’t. When i do drink now socially, after 6 beers i wake up in the morning with weak legs and such bad anxiety… i personally know in my head, i over think &amp; think i’m gunna pass out or have an attack wherever u go thats new or uncomfortable or sometimes even just a place i go regularly. its ruined my friendships, my work, and many many other things i’ve missed out on being a typical 23 year old. any help would be appreciated. 


(also was a heavy cocaine user for a long time, over a year and a half sober, thought doesn’t even cross my mind anymore… i take pride in that; and know i’ll never do it again.) thank you so much guys… if anyone here has gone though this, and have some sort of help or input id love to hear it)

I am also a healthy eater, take tons of vitamins. I’m just looking to move on in life &amp; be able to be free again without this feeling anymore.",Advice on life.

2022-11-08 12:28:50,depression,"I have been thinking about depression and how I am personally affected by it. I think for me the hardest part is realizing that not everyone suffers from depression. It has been a constant in my life from a young age. However because of the stigma of saying “I am depressed,” I don’t say it ever. But it is an illness similar to diabetes or chronic pain. I feel like if I would talk about it more, I might feel better. But it bothers so many people to hear someone else say“I am depressed.” Also, the actions of others can be very harmful to someone suffering from depression. It would be similar to forcing a diabetic to eat food high in sugar. The problem is while most people know to not offer a diabetic person sugary foods, they don’t realize things they say or do or don’t do can be very harmful to someone with depression. For example, being short with me and not making an effort can send me over the edge sometimes. I wish people could see that I need them to reach out to me instead of me always doing it first. 
I tend to be direct and confrontational when I am actually very sad and depressed. Sometimes I feel like I alienate people first so they don’t do it back to me or do it to me first.",Is depression like diabetes?

Anyway I was there to comfort her and months went by and our relationship was stronger than ever, she told me I'm the only one who gets her and I'm the only one she got, when I felt it's the time I told her I love her and she said I love you too but after telling her that several times I realized she doesn't understand how I mean it, so today I've told her how I really feel about her, she told me she's back with her boyfriend who ghosted her and I wasn't really expecting that, I expected rejection and I would've taken it but getting back with that guy made me feel something I've never felt, it's like a mix of every bad emotion you can get, sadness, anger, jealousy, disappointment, disgust, betrayal, depression and with all that I feel emptiness in my abdomen and I felt betrayed because she didn't tell me they're back that shocked me while I thought we knew everything about each other it like we never were even friends i feel she lied to me the whole time and deceived me, honestly now I feel some hate for her. maybe I'm selfish to feel that way idk I can't control how I feel I wish I didn't care but I do.

I don’t even know if what I’m majoring in is what I wanna do because it doesn’t come as easy for me as it does with others in my class who seem to have so much experience and already know everything. This destroys any spur of motivation I might gain throughout the day which I already lack. My other classes only stress me out and I feel like I’m trying to NOT fail rather than learn because of all the work on top of my stress. I also suck at everything I do. I have no talents, true passions, or hobbies to make up for my lackluster life. After high school it seems like I just sleep most of my days away or sit in silence in my room to procrastinate or because I just don’t know what else to do.

I don’t know if I’ll even be able to afford to stay in school after this semester if I wanted to. I try to reach out to my friends by bringing these things up as a call for help and although appreciated their responses are always similar or recycled. I regret many of my decisions as well as actions. Intrusive thoughts are getting harder to avoid every day. I love my family but I feel like I can’t express it enough to them with the kind of stoic personality I have. It saddens me to think that they might not know how much I love them.

2022-11-08 11:18:51,depression,"This may be a long one so buckle in as a large bit of this will involve a life story.

Born into a lower class family where it was just my mom &amp; my four older brothers &amp; eldest sister.
There was over a ten year gap between me and any of my siblings &amp; they disliked the fact that well I was the youngest therefore I was Mom's favorite &amp; always got the special treatment so obviously I was the target of ""brothers being brothers"" which never really bothered me although I always cried like a lil pussy.
But my main escape from it all was Video Games, Halo &amp; Mass Effect being my favorite as I loved the idea of exploring space with alien friends at my side.
Growing up I chamged friends a lot, no one really stayed with me very long until high school where I found four friends &amp; we stayed together, until they blocked me after high school due to my views &amp; annoyance I guess I mever got an answer although currently we're back on speaking terms.
My dad is a literal druggie who somehow walks free today after literally murdering his best friend over coke(my mom has great taste in men."") So he was never in my life.


But anyway I'm getting off track so I'll skip over some details recently as a 19 year old male nothing is just fun anymore, as a kid I'd always come home after school and have a blast playing games or playing with my army men toys.
But every day I come home to the house me and one of my brothers share, I turn on the Xbox and just nothing, I stare at the screen occasionally looking at my phone until I go to sleep for work, I try going out but I never do anything as where I live there's nothing to do in this town unless you own an ATV or dirt bike which I dont, and I try going to the gym but I get no satisfaction from it, I just get bored after half an hour but I try to stay for two hours. 
Games nowadays just suck ass &amp; my wifi is to ass to run anything good &amp; my Xbox is to ass to run anything good, so I'm just in limbo of work, stare blankly at my screen, sleep, repeat.
And anytime I'm at work I just insult myself in my head, I call myself many many things every damn day and I keep telling myself to take my brothers gun and end it all but I've tried it before and I'm simply to much of a pussy to do it, I'm just so damn tired of feeling weak, stupid, useless, bored, tired. But anything I try to do to fix it all I think about is playing games &amp; how bored I am.
If I had my way I'd just cease to exist because I know I have a problem I don't Know what to do, my last psychiatrist tried to make me of safe places in my hesd but I thought that was stupid &amp; when I tried nothing changed.

2022-11-08 11:06:30,depression,"So I moved to Florida from a northern state, and I experience depression and anxiety. I thought that it'd help those things but actually in my case it made them worse overall. I'll go into detail on the positives and negatives of living here and how it may affect you.

Positives:
1. Sunshine- it is definitely sunnier here than alot of places, and cus the sun is stronger here than many other places it can help provide adequate vitamin d, if you go out into the sun enough each day
2. Beaches- they're beautiful here, no doubt about it, especially in south Florida. And laying out on a beach will def help raise your vitamin d levels.
3. No state income tax- pretty great stuff, you get what you worked for.
4. Medical marijuana- med weed is a thing here and it's cheaper than many places, so if ur into that, then that's available here
5. Variety of places to live- Jacksonville is different than Orlando, Orlando is different than Naples, Naples is different than miami, if you look there are distinct differences between places

50/50's, positive or negative depending on you:
1. The weather- you either love it or you hate it. If you don't like lightning, you'll hate it here. If you don't like alot of rain, you'll hate it here. If you don't like hot humid weather u'll hate it here. The weather is cooler in the northern parts, hotter in the southern parts. For me personally, I find the weather often times kinda boring, so it's just not my thing.
2. Scenery- some people love the landscape in Florida, some people don't. I'm in the middle. Palm trees are nice, but Florida is *insanely* flat for the most part, so if you like hills, this is not the state for you. 
3. Hurricanes- depending on the category and the location, hurricanes either are a nice experience or a terrible one. On the coast they can be very dangerous, and frankly a huge hassle. If you're in the central areas, they are still quite dangerous but sometimes the sounds of it can be oddly relaxing. Schools close for them too.
4. Traffic- being from a much bigger metro area, the traffic here doesn't really bother me, but if you're from a small town you may find it to be pretty bad 
5. Lack of seasons- for some this may be great, for me I personally can't stand it. I miss the fall, the snow all that. The lack of seasons can make it hard to feel engaged in ur surroundings here. If you like pumpkin patches in fall, sledding and hot cocoa in the winter, u'll have a hard time here.
6. Seasonal depression- yes seasonal depression still affects Floridians. The days get shorter here just like other places in the US and there's less light, so it def is a thing here still.
7. theme parks/tourism- so obv we have Disney and Universal, and those parks are very fun to go to. But one thing to know is that if you move to Orlando, it is tourism season *all the time*. This means that u'll see hotel transport vans on I4, entitled tourists, etc., all the time. And so that can be cool at first, but the issue is it makes it really hard to feel like this place is home. 
8. Natural activities and wildlife- Florida does have some really cool natural things from springs, airboats, and all that. Alligators are def a thing here but they're usually really lazy and don't do much.

Negatives:
1. Cost of living- if you're moving to a coastal area or a major metro, Florida can be quite expensive. For example, an apartment in Orlando, somewhat near Disney, and not even in a good safe area, can be upwards of 2400 bucks a month. 
2. Crime- sadly this is one of the major things that has made my anxiety and depression worse here. Florida is weird in that, in the major metro areas crime tends to mix in everywhere here. Most metro areas around the country have a notable bad area in the city, and then relatively safe suburbs. Florida is usually not like that. Its very common here for the nicest areas, even in the suburbs, to back right up to a really bad area. This means that crime bleeds all around. So in many places in Florida, especially in the Tampa, Miami, and Orlando metros, it can be hard to fully feel safe. And trust me, no amount of tropical scenery and weather will make you feel better if you don't feel safe.
3. Tolls/spread out- in certain metros, Florida has toll roads and those add up fast. Many of Floridas metros are very spread out too meaning it can take quite a long time just to drive to a store that maybe took you 10 min to drive to back home.
4. The people- this one is another thing that really made my depression and anxiety worse. This does not apply to everyone, by any means, but it is more common than not in my experience. From my experience, Floridians tend to not be very friendly, and are surprisingly cliquey, especially in Miami and Orlando. People here just don't really wanna talk to you, or be friends with you, and honestly for me that was super hard cus I like being friendly to people and love to make friends. And if you go down to the Miami metro, many people tend to be just downright mean and aggressive. So it can feel very isolating at times, and again, if that is something you thrive off of, it doesn't matter how tropical it is, you will not be happy. 

If you read through this, and are considering moving here, I'd say to use this to make ur own pros and cons list and see if the good outweights the bad for you, and vice versa. And if anyone thinks of anything else, feel free to comment","If you suffer from depression and/or anxiety and think moving to Florida would help, read this first"
2022-11-08 11:00:09,depression,"I would like to tell you about my whole relationship

Me male (19) and my ex female (19)were together for a year.  She was the most beautiful girl and her character was perfect. It was the first serious relationship for us two. We broke up two times.

I am a guy who analyzes a person a lot before going into a relationship.  I rejected women very often because I saw minimal disagreements.  But she, she was just like me.  Of character.  The ways of thinking.  Her humor.  She was exactly what I envisioned as my future wife.  But she also had a few problems.  She was a sensible girl.  She was always very insecure.  She asked me countless times if everything was fine with us. She always was afraid I was going to leave her.  Because of her insecurities, I put so much work into getting her to feel secure and enjoy the relationship.  I always told her to communicate.  That she could always tell me if she feels fear, insecurity or anything else.  I would then make sure that she feels safe.

We kept the relationship a secret from our parents.  When she turned 18, I gave her a box of personal belongings and gifts and a letter that I put my heart into.

She hid the gifts in her room and her mother found the letter and pictures of both of us.  Unexpectedly the mother freaked out, tore up the letter and forced her to burn it.  Her mother hit her and said if she doesnt break up she will tell her father.  She is Albanian and I am not and because of the nationality the mother freaked out that bad.  My heart broke when I heard that and I teared up a little.  When she told me we had to break up, I started crying with her.  I actually never cry.  I tried to persuade her for a couple of days.  My older brother, friends, etc. spoke to her and she was way too scared to Jeep the relationship going and decided to break up anyway.  Eventually we both broke contact to move on. We met to switch back our hoodies and she gave me a letter because I did that for her too.  She didn't want to get over me.  She wanted to keep me in her heart forever.

We both went to the same school and saw each other every day, which made the breakup even harder.  We ignored each other when we saw us. One time I saw her run to the toilet right after she saw me and thats when I realized how bad she felt with it. It was so hurting to watch so I texted her and persuaded her to get back together.  Our plan was that when shes older and more independent, with her own apartment, studying, etc., we would tell her parents that she has a boyfriend. Me, all my friends and my brothers would support her during that time.

So we got back together We couldn’t see each other, because her mother could get suspicious.  It wasnt even possible to go for a walk because she was so scared that her mother would call her at that moment we are together.  I chose her anyway and went through everything with her.  At first I complained that short walks were not possible, but I accepted it. I was satisfied.  We whispered on the phone at night and slept with the call going to at least feel our togetherness there.  We left class in the middle of the lesson and stayed together for 10 minutes and I was happy with it.

We had a time where we often argued, but we got through it too.  I wasn't the most mature and often got involved in discussions or problems that weren't that big. I was the problem.  At least we always discussed everything objectively.

About half a year passed after the incident with the mother. I graduated. The relationship went very well.  Up to the point when she came back from her vacation.

This was 6 weeks before we broke up again. We couldn't see each other for three and a half weeks because she had to go on a vacation with her family straight after my vacation.  Phone calls were rarely possible as I often had no internet and she was with her family.  She texted me everyday how much she missed me.  How she would want me to stay with her.  How much she loved me. She sent me pictures of herself smiling and happy as she texted with me.  
She made a Spotify playlist with a picture of us two and the playlist was named “don’t forget me :(“.  She was afraid I might lose feelings during the vacation.

When I came back after my 1 week vacation I started to feel bad.  There were some things in my life that bothered me.  An illness my mother got and I started to realize that my career as a professional athlete is no longer possible due to injuries.  I was at home a lot. I fell into a hole but always tried to stay positive and not let anyone see it.  My friends were all right back on vacation so I was all alone.  The only thing that made me happy during this time was the messages from my girlfriend.

Two and a half weeks later she came back alone from vacation and I picked her up. I immediately noticed that she was different.  I just thought she was tired, took her bags and we went to her house together.  Since her parents were still at vacation, we were able to be with together and spend a lot of time with each other.  However, I didn't have the strength to do things like going out.  So we slept and cuddled together most of the time.  I cried in her arms because I felt so bad. I told her i was going through things. During this time I realized that she was a little different.  It wasn't like before the vacation.  I thought the love has weakened because we didn’t see each other for such a long time. Because that’s how I felt. I felt less love being together.

After her parents came back, everything had changed.  She texted me less, called me less, stopped showing love and I didn't understand what was going on. Even after I asked her about it several times, she said everything is fine. But I knew there was something. 

A couple days later I told her I'm fine mentally and I want to know what is wrong with her. That was the only time i lied to her. Obviously I was still doing bad. She then told me that she had lost her feelings and wanted to break up with me. The reason she gave was that we no longer fit together. That it won't work out with her parents. I didn't understand any of her reasons. I was shocked.  It was like a gunshot in my heart.  I was upset that she hadn't communicated with me even though I always said it was essential in a relationship. She said she doesn’t have feelings for a long time and tried everything.

It doesn't make any sense to me. Does a person say how much they love you 4 weeks before the breakup?  That she can’t wait to see me?  That I am the only thing she wants? That I am the only person who can make her happy?  In addition, she talks about future plans 2 weeks before the break up. It felt perfect a month ago. For both of us. But i can‘t do anything than accept it.

I really dont know how sex works but based off porn its like when I see a pornstar enjoying a bigger dick then she gets with a smaller one its like a downgrade and maybe shes not feeling that good with the big one. Thats whats always lingered when I tried sympathizing with non virgin women. No matter how attractive they are id always imagine someone bigger and experienced were previously with her as she’s attractive and probably only gets with taller guys bigger guys etc. Its an unfortunate reality im in thanks to porn, and im getting over the addiction but its extremely hard.

2022-11-07 16:56:25,depression,"I am alone.

A lot of people say this, but they still have somebody in their lives.

No wife, no kids. I've had one-night stands periodically, but no serious relationships since I was 18. EIGHTEEN. Back when I was a normal person. My dad and brother died when I was entering adulthood. It splintered my family. I haven't spoken with my mother or sisters since. We didn't get along and my dad was the glue that held us together. He was my best friend and after losing him, I felt like I lost everything. I went from a bubbly, outgoing person, to a total recluse and unwilling to share my life with anyone. I was never close with aunts or uncles, cousins, so they're all out too. No friends; the couple I did have were people not worth taking a bullet for. They'd lied, stolen from me, talked about me behind my back, and weren't there for me when I needed them the most. 

I work in one of the most antisocial work environments I've ever been in. I've been on the job for six months and don't know a soul. I go to school and am working on finishing up two degrees (which is why I'm at the job, it's a weird school schedule), but I'm much older than my peers. As such, they tend to veer away from me and toward people their own age. I don't blame them.

So I don't really know anybody. There is nobody in my life I can think to call when something good or bad happens. And nobody ever calls me. Holidays are spent alone, any adventures I go on are solo.

Anywhere I go, I try to keep a smile on my face and always try to be kind and courteous to others. People ask me how I'm doing and it's always the typical responses, but they don't know I'm actually drowning inside.

I feel like the person in the movies who's standing still in a crowded public place, while time speeds up and people whiz by all around him. I'm just kind of floating through life and have never felt so utterly alone on a planet of almost 8 billion people.

Some days aren't terrible. I'm an introverted person and love my own company. But every once in a while, my primal brain bubbles up and asks where my tribe is. I get hit with an intense sadness and loneliness. But when I try to find a tribe, people can sense something is wrong with me - like I'm broken - no matter how hard I try to smile or be warm. If I do find people that I can somewhat connect with, I always keep them at arm's length. I never let people become true friends and learn about things that are deep and dear within me. I don't like feeling vulnerable.

This has been something I've sucked up for years. It's not a new occurrence. I've worn this predicament on my sleeve like a badge of honor. ""I'm tough, I'm doing this all by myself. Most people couldn't do this,"" I say. But let's be real: most people wouldn't **want** to do this. It's a horrible way to live.

There are so many opportunities I've pissed away into the wind: jobs, women, new friendships, new places to visit. I've kept myself locked away because I'm afraid of being hurt. I think the reality is, I'm already hurt. I'm severely wounded and cannot heal. I'm terrified of people seeing what I'm really going through. I don't want their pity or their sympathy.

But I can't hold all of this together forever. And I can't pretend that as a man, I'm impervious to all of this pain. If there was anything I wish I could have right now, it would be the loving embrace of someone - anyone. I just want someone's shoulder I can sob into. I want someone to hold me and tell me that I'm going to find my way out of this. I don't even know what that's like. Never have felt close enough to anyone where I could just be totally vulnerable with them. And anyone who does have that, know that I am so envious of you.

2022-11-07 15:43:28,depression,"It's over. Nearly a year with my gf and now it's over. 

We got into a fight earlier and during the fight while she went out of the room I punched the wall, multiple times. My right had is still recovering from surgery from the first time I punched the wall over a fight. After the fight we made up. I went to the bathroom and noticed how swollen my knuckle was. I went to show her by jokingly saying ""wanna see something gross?"" That instantly triggered her and she went on a walk with her sister. When she came back, she kicked me out.

After two days she finally sent me a note saying she wishes it to be over and that she felt our relationship was toxic. I can see her point. I wasn't the most supportive in her eyes. A jealous boyfriend I am, and she isn't wrong when she says that if I wasn't the one who made her happy, I would ruin her happiness. 

But through my eyes, I just wanted to be her main person. And it felt like I was only that when I specifically asked for it. I just got home from work and the intrusive thoughts I felt the first night have now returned a hundred fold. I would never take .y own life simply because I'm too much of a pussy to do it. But that doesn't stop me from wishing it. 

My relationship prior to this was an even worse toxic relationship on both of our ends. And I fell into depression hard, quitting my job, eating a couple times a week. I don't feel like this break up will send me into the same spiral thanks to going to therapy, but the weight of this depression feels a million times heavier.

Now, I don't just want someone to talk to or for someone to listen to my problems. I need someone.

2022-11-07 15:24:06,depression,"""...I dont enjoy anything"" he said while enjoying a cigarette.

It was a common complaint from his mouth, but he was unsure if the supposed evidence justified the feeling that drove the words out from
his lips.

""Thats not true, at least, not from what I can tell. You enjoy your cooking, if nothing else. Its like you calling. I'd like to think you enjoy
being around us. You enjoy the cat, and that cigarette.""

They both looked at the smoke, curling up so briefly to its recognizable form before dispersing into the wind

""That's true. But, from my perspective, what good is a fleeting enjoyment if the only thing it seems to add to your continued experience is more
sadness??"" He inquired, flicking at his cigarette emphatically.

The Paranoiac was aware of how selfish he sounded and was. But being aware of this selfishness didn't resolve his pain.

""...This cigarette is good. And, after I have smoked it, it will have been good... I will be both glad that I smoked it, and glad to have the
memory of smoking it. But I wont feel better. I'll feel the same overall, on a visceral level... Yea.""

""But you're telling yourself that!"" The Man interjected, after remaining silent for the early conversation. ""Of course you wont believe in your
enjoyment if you tell yourself you're incapable. Its a self-fulfilling prophecy.""

""Chicken or the egg"" he replied. ""And I am not incapable, its just that every joy costs its weight in misery. Yin-and-yang shit.""

He laughed a bit in earnest, and ventured:

""I guess pearls before swine would be fitting, too: because I feel like the most ungrateful motherfukcer in the world. In my head I am grateful.
Like, when I think about it. But as for how gratitude feels... I'm convinced its the same feeling as sadness. I'm convinced Love, happiness, fear,
anxiety, guilt, comfort... they're all the same feeling as sadness, because they all seem to lead to it eventually.""

The Paranoiac paused. The Two were watching, digesting what he had said with far more concern and empathy than he deserved.        

""...And it doesn't get better. You just get better at dealing; better at hiding it. From yourself and others. But it's there, and no matter
how long you can push it back, how burly your mental arms get, they're still holding all that mysterious weight. It will take its toll.
Makes you crave, no, need a break. Something to tag in, just for a moment, so you can recover your strength enough to go on.""

""But we can tag in. Better than a chemical could!We can take some of the burden"" The Man said with confidence.
He had a comforting look on his face, and the fact that this good natured comfort, bolstered to a level that could work miracles was wasted on HIM,
led our Paranoiac to a pang of sadness...
A pang so deep it didn't register, for it had to stab in amongst the others, festering like needles in his Soul.  

The Paranoiac didn't want to be honest. The truth was cold, but he felt obliged.

...""If that were true, we'd be the same person"" He said.

Both their expressions fell back, though he wasn't sure into what. It wasn't possible to explain the feeling, not in this world, and he
wouldn't want to anyways. To understand is to experience, and sharing his burdens in full (if it were feasible) would thus make him an
evil man.

He shifted out of philosophical context, for if he didnt, he felt as though the world might end.

""And now I'm paranoid, too, you see. I feel as though I can either die from the problem itself, or at the hands of its solution.
I can't be sure which one will kill me quicker, for I assume the timing is different... But both outcomes make me a bit sad, if I'm honest.""

...

""My dope is my choice. It's the only power, among a fair few, that makes me FEEL like I have power against the void, despite its habit of bringing
me closer. But maybe that's not the drug itself, but its subject. Maybe the only thing wrong with drugs is the people who use them.""

...

""So are you going to use tonight?"" Asked The Woman. The Man looked at nothing in disappointment, aware of the answer.

""Don't hold it against me if I do"" said the Paranoiac, in pointless ambiguity.

""I will"" said The Man.

""It wouldn't be right if you didn't"" the Paranoiac half spoke, half thought: the tail end of his conversation with his parents was hard to remember,
except in general, because the only thing on his mind now was how sad this whole situation made him. He'd have to use drugs to avoid the sadness,
and that would also make him sad... What a bother.

At l(e)ast his arms would get a break. Well, the mental ones anyways.",The Paregoric Paranoiac

Im jus a 19 year old dude in the first semester of my college and im starting to regret my decision. i took a night college course since at day im working from 8 AM to 5PM on Monday to Saturday and then college from 7PM to 10PM on Monday to Friday. I also need to complete additional assignments which usually took around 2-3 hours so i only have around 4-5 hours of sleep everyday, working on a steel mill is already physically exhausting for me and college only makes it worse by being mentally exhausting.

The college itself also sucked. I rarely have offline class and usually it's online.

I basically need to learn,teach and do all of the assignments all by myself and i spend 20 percent of my monthly paycheck for this.

I hate how i can't relax after going home and my daily life is always constant game of going to work-college-finishing assignment before deadline and that's just it i cant even take a break on weekends because there's always another assignment i haven't finished

I've had a pretty bad life, since I was born. (Abuse and sexual abuse, homelessness, bullied everyday, bad drinking problem)

I was living in a friends shed by the age of 16, and drinking pretty much all day everyday until about age 22. Also medicated since the age 17

I went to uni aged 21 thinking things would get better but it didn't at first, I then met my now husband in my second year, things got better and I was able to cut back on the drinking after being together for a few years. 

But then Uni ended and we had nowhere to go, so we were homeless, living in a tent in a garden for the next two and a half years. 

During this time, I started seeking help and wanting help for the first time in my life, so I got medicated again (anti depressant.)

Because I have tried to kill myself a few times, I was added to a waiting list for therapy, which took almost two years of waiting. I was then prescribed mood stabilisers and antipsychotics and told I was also suffering from CPTSD. (this was around a year ago.

I''ve since completed all 12 therapy sessions (dbt) but I feel that it didn't help much. I still have to check in with a mental health nurse.  

Tonight things have gotten really bad, I want to die.

Why am I living, I feel so worthless. 

I add nothing to this world, all I do is sit/sleep around all day getting high, I've quit the booze for the most part, but it's just been replaced with weed, I can't do anything without a smoke.

2022-11-07 15:00:50,depression,Whenever I start to feel depressed there’s always this kind of strange feeling of comforting familiarity. It feels sort of like coming back to your parents house from college and sleeping in the room you grew up in. Sometimes I feel like being depressed is easier. I just slip back into like an old worn in shoe. And I don’t really notice it first. When I’m going through a period where I’m not depressed and I try to think of what the depression was like or tell someone about it it’s really hard to explain it. Depression isn’t something that jumps on you or pushes you down from the top. It’s like the tide lapping at your toes. And you could step out and walk back up the beach but you don’t because that feeling of the water around your feet just feels normal. And it rises and rises and you keep having chances to walk out of the water but you don’t and you go about your life until one day you realize you can barely even see the beach anymore. And then you try to swim towards it and you feel yourself moving through the water but the tide is pulling you out faster than you’re swimming and eventually you get so fucking tired and it turns from being a fight to get back to the shore into a fight not to drown. And you can always feel yourself slowly losing the fight but for some reason the water is so warm. The water is never cold or shocking or scary or off putting. I don’t know this is common or unusual but I’ve been struggling pretty bad recently and I’d love to hear if anyone else has this same feeling.,Comfort in depression
2022-11-07 14:50:22,depression,"I (M14) have been dealing with self esteem issues for like 6 years now. I've been suicidal for a couple years too. I've always been pretty pacifistic.

Anyway I've been dealing with these emotions for a while now, and I've tried a lot of things to try and stop them. I tried more sleep, less sleep, crying all the time, no crying, nothing helped.

2022-11-07 14:45:26,depression,"Hey,

I had to get surgery done on my nose to improve my breathing. However, I can fix my breathing by using sprays or using sticky hands that spread my nostrils, so I have not much problem living with it.

However, I wanted a definitive fix just to be able to live without thinking about it.

After reading a few articles, I’ve realized how bad the consequences can be in case of failure, and how bad it could actually worsen my entire life.

An hour before the surgery and I walked away, apologizing and of course paying, but I walked away nonetheless. I feel culprit and I have a feeling as if I’ve just failed something, even though I’m also relieved by the fact that I won’t get this surgery.

I’m afraid my family will say I’m afraid of everything, or that I’m weak. I’m afraid my doctor will get badly pissed or that I could struggle from social or familial consequences. It may seem irrational but yeah…

How should I feel?

2022-11-07 14:09:32,depression,"basically the title but it's a bit more complicated i guess

i guess as an introduction, i'm a 17 year old transmasc with depression/anxiety, autism, and physical disabilities causing chronic pain and fatigue. (but i can't figure out if that stuff is real or if it's in my head. everyone around me believes it's real but i can't help but feel like a fraud.) i also have c-ptsd and have gone through a lot of trauma during the the relevant window of time. my parents are fantastic, super loving and caring, we are financially comfortable, but we have a lot of disabilities and mental health issues throughout the family so my parents are under a lot of stress pretty much all the time. i've been expected to take care of myself for about 8 years.

i've been struggling to take care of myself ever since i was old enough to be expected to take care of myself, which is also about as long as i've been definitively depressed (i.e, i had already started s*lf h*rming). 

and so somehow i've been getting away with completely not taking care of myself for the past 8 years. i shower maybe once a month. for about 9 months up until a recent suic*de attempt i wore the same outfit (underwear included) every single day and to sleep. i never brush my teeth. i eat nothing but junk, and not much of it because my appetite is barely there. i use marijuana daily to help with my pain and am currently in the process of trying to get a medical card. i have a medication i'm supposed to inject once a week and i maybe i do it once every two weeks, sometimes once a month. i know it's objectively fucking disgusting but i just can't find the motivation to even care let alone change it.

but at the same time as just wanting to give into it and be gross, i also don't want to be a lazy piece of shit and rely on my parents for the rest of my life. i've been lying and somehow keeping it under the radar for the entire time because i'm just so unbelievably embarrassed. i can't admit it at this point. and even if i did, my parents (specifically my mom) are consistently under insane amounts of stress and if i admitted all of this it would put so much more stress on them and my mom has struggled with depression for her whole life and i have this fear that all the stress and bullshit me and my siblings put her through is going to drive her to s*icide even though I know logically that won't happen. i cant bear to put any more stress on them. my two younger siblings already need so much care, one of them has more severe autism than me and one of them is just young, and i'm supposed to be the easy child. i want to be the easy child so so bad. i love the amount of freedom i have, i love being treated like an adult. my parents shouldn't have to coddle and take care of their 17 year old. i'm almost a fucking adult. not to mention how expensive it is to care for two disabled children and one  who's not necessarily disabled but still has special challenges. therapists and everything aren't in-network, i had to take two ambulance rides for my s*icide attempt and i feel so fucking guilty for it.

i can't work right now but i feel like i'm being delusional about that. i tried to have a job recently but i had to quit after just a few weeks when i tried to commit s*icide a few months ago. it was a retail position and it was so painful every day i couldn't deal with it. i hate my life so much but everything about it is ultimately my fault and i just can't find the strength to care. after my s*icide attempt i did a very intensive therapy program where i was asked every day if i was keeping up with self care and hygiene. i said yes every single day. i couldn't bear to admit the truth.

i've been medicated for depression  for three years now and there have been long stretches of time where i would say the medication was working, but i still won't take care of myself, no matter how badly i want to. i'm starting to think this is just an inherent trait of mine and i feel like i'm going to be a disgusting piece of shit for my entire life. my gpa is horrible (2.7 or so, not good enough to get into college) and i can't imagine a career where i am happy. i don't know what to do. i can't dig myself out of this hole of dirt and lies and fucking suffering and honestly i wish i was dead. (i don't know if i'm allowed to say that here but it's the truth)

i have a therapist and a psychiatrist and the most wonderful (albeit busy) family in the world. i'm in pretty consistent trauma therapy but i'm so overwhelmed with it it's so hard to get through everything. I feel like i'm letting my family down by being this way. I just want to be a good kid. i feel like i'm just barely staying afloat. i don't want to be here anymore.

2022-11-07 13:59:38,depression,"   Hi. I'm 20.  I was born in a small village. A lot has changed since then. First I moved to the city and then to a bigger city for the conservatory.

   My dad was a farmer. He was uneducated. So I had to educate myself. At first, my grades were very good. Then I got bullied with the change of social environment. Physical and mental. Sometimes sexual. Then I shut myself up. My grades got worse. Anxiety broke out. I wanted to get rid of all this and become a theater actor. Our financial situation was not very good, but after years of depression, theater reconnected me to life. 

I stayed with a relative in the city where the exam was held. Things didn't go well. I failed. Currently, my family is working to send me money. This is killing me. I've never had a girlfriend. I don't have any friends. I have to work to stand on my own feet. No problem. I work. But there is no job. I've been looking for a while and can't find any jobs. 

   I like to draw. Listen to music. The theatre. I love art in many ways. But the life I'm in right now pushes me out of it. Which is okay, I can push myself for a while. But there is no exit. Have you watched The Perks of Being a Wallflower? I don't want much, just a few good people, good music, and a livable life. There is no way out where life pushes me. It's getting worse day by day. I can't find a job, I can't be interested in art, I can't make friends and I can't breathe anymore. It's like something inside of me is dying over time. Maybe if my country's economy wasn't so bad... Maybe something could have happened. Maybe things would be better if I got cancer, if only for a while. Anxiety about the future can be over. People can treat me better. The people behind me may never know that I am unhappy. I do not know. ""Maybes"" hurt me a lot. I've been hesitant to write this for a while because every time I come in here I see people with bigger problems. They still exist. But the longer I wait, the more the pain grows.

   I think the time I was bullied had consequences that made me fear judgment and humiliation for my suffering. Thank you for your time. And for trying to feel me. It's nice to think that one day when my feelings die, there will be someone out there who feels for me. Take care of yourself. Sorry for my bad English too. If I was stuck with this, my anxiety wouldn't let me write all this. Love you.",I'm dying inside
2022-11-07 13:55:57,depression," I wrote this in the middle of wanting to kms, I guess take this.

I just don't get the point of living my pathetic painful life just to end up dead with nobody remembering me. The fact that millions of people die every year and most of them probably go unnoticed. Unless you're famous then millions of people miss you while also wishing you were dead all along. If I died in my sleep it would take 17 hours minimum for anyone to even notice, only 3 people I know would actually cry and miss me, and after that, I would be forgotten forever. Nobody in the entire 7 billion people in the world would have to know how I'm feeling right now and how I have felt my whole life. It's always “keep going :)” but without reason. And then the only thing I have on my list of reasons is my cats and once they die there's nothing. Speaking of cats, I would prefer to live with them in whatever ""afterlife"" is real. Why would anyone on this planet choose to continue life when it's so shit? There's no place on earth that isn't having a crisis, there's so many extinct animals because of humans, there's so many starving people on the streets, there's trash in almost all wildlife, and we cant even give people basic rights. This world is falling apart and people are still forced to go to school, go to work, get up out of bed. If this is what it's come to I'm surprised the su1c1\*e rates are higher. ""Just deal with it"". Why would anyone be expected to deal with this? Oh I know, because the people who are supposed to deal with it are out in yachts drinking Chardonnay knowing that because they have money they can do whatever they want. If little kids are making more change in this world than adults, that's worrying. Especially when mental health for newer generations are dropping. Depression cases are higher than ever, and the pandemic was never helping, and su1c1\*e rates are rising too. How are some people going to tell kids that picking up a single piece of trash or planting a single tree will help the earth? Because unless you were to get paid for doing these basic things nobody will do it. The people who do try and save the earth, unfortunately, aren't rich enough, and they will never be heard. Why would anyone want to try and save the earth when it's a lost cause? Let's even get started on school, because it's one of the causes that almost all people with mental illness would point to as a factor. School is unfair and unreasonable. Imagine if we told an alien species that we force children from ages 5-16 to devote almost their entire life to this school. Wake up early, stay at the school for 6-10 hours, while at school you have to participate in every class, follow every single stupid rule, listen and understand the multiple(over 7) unnecessary subjects, punish them when they don't listen to the teachers, ridicule them for not understanding, even control when they eat or use the bathroom. Now this is bad, but take the average 13 hours of not being at school out of a day. Subtract 8 for time sleeping and we already have 5 hours to do what we want. Now we subtract the time of doing homework most teachers give, for about an hour, so 4 hours. Now subtract 30 minutes for eating, 3.5 hours. Now subtract another 30 minutes for getting to and from school, 3 hours. Now we have to clean, shower, brush our teeth, do chores, that's already down to 2 maybe 1.5 hours left to do what we actually want to do. And then, (this us the best part) If you DON'T go to this hell, you or your parents get arrested. Again, for not going to this place that most people hate, you get put in JAIL. Now most people wouldn't want that, so, just don't try at school, right? Most people can just grow to take the ridicule and don't care about grades and behavior. Well that wouldn't work either because the punishment for that, oddly enough, is having to take the exact same classes with the same teachers AGAIN putting you behind other students. Don't want to do that either? Well you have to go to summer school. ""What's summer school?"" The poor aliens would ask. In our school system, you get a summer break between school years that lasts all of summer. If you fail the class, you have to take, well, summer school. Basically they take away your only break and force you to go to school during summertime. And guess what? If you fail summer school you have to make up for it by staying in school longer. The alien species would think that were insane. They would think that our society is doomed. Which it is. ""Just get therapy, you sound like you need it"" Why? Why would you pay money to be lied to and feel slightly better? But what about the millions in poverty who actually need it and can't pay for the help and assistance? Too bad. That's what this society has led to. 

Too, fucking, bad.

I just wanted to vent a bit about my life--if anyone wants to respond I'd really appreciate it but you don't have to. I understand this is a lot of text.

I graduated from a fairly prestigious college back in May. The entirety of senior year I was dreading graduating for various reasons. No job lined up, no real relationships under my belt, very little sex, and overall a disappointing college experience compared to what I hoped for in high school. The one good thing to come out of it was I unexpectedly became a very good drummer, although I don't have the experience or connections to become a pro. I'm fairly confident that I could become a pro musician with a bit of the right help, whether that be joining the right band, going to the right jam session, learning a few more secrets, etc. But as it stands, I'm basically a hobby drummer that spends too much time practicing for no rational reason.

I didn't graduate with a job lined up, but I landed something not-great shortly after graduation. It pays a bit less than the average for my college's graduates and it's not prestigious. The low salary pretty much requires me to live with my parents. Still, I was hopeful going into it--I naively figured work of any kind would bring me some kind of fulfillment, especially compared to doing nothing I did from June-August. I was wrong--this job is incredibly boring because it's essentially doing the same exact process over and over throughout the day. It's remote so I spend pretty much the entire day in my bedroom. But the worst part is my coworkers. I've come to realize they aren't very intelligent. I'm vastly outperforming them and my mangers recognize and reward that, but it's not enough to bring much feeling of actualization. I'm studying for the CFA exam but I honestly can't see myself getting a better job. I've just been rejected so many times it seems like insanity to hope for something like that. In my last interview for another job I supposedly came close but lost out due to lack of experience. 

Today, I asked out a girl I used to talk to and flirt with in college because I'm supposed to go back there next weekend. It was a bit of a longshot but it seemed like she liked me, and we've been talking almost every day for the past week. She said she was busy the nights I'll be there. That rejection wouldn't set me off like this on its own, it's just that my last date was well over a year ago, and it killed me when the girl didn't want a second one. I then fell for another girl with a boyfriend who was leading me on. I had talked to her about her behavior crossing into relationship territory, and she kept doing those same things going forward, simultaneously making me fall completely in love with her while feeling guilty about my intentions in hanging out with her. I did the right thing in pulling away but I've felt like shit pretty much ever since then. The days I would spend with her were honestly some of the happiest of my life. Overall, she is an utterly beautiful person, inside and out. She made me feel like a man, more confident and with a sense of purpose. We were close to the point where I felt like I was in a relationship with her even though there were no explicitly romantic acts. I didn't know the girl I asked out tonight as well, but I really thought this could've been the start of something. 

Maybe my expectations are too elevated, but that's the only thing that has kept me going throughout my recent life. But still, I find myself disappointed in my career and relationships about 99% of the time. Every swing is a miss. I can buy a better bat and lessons but sometimes it just seems like baseball (life) isn't for me. Having had such a disappointing college experience with little to show for it makes me question what the point of trying for anything is. I hate where I am, and I can't get ahead. I'm on the dating apps and the farthest I've gotten is a facetime--afterwards, she then ghosted me shortly before our planned date. 

Anyway, the gist of the story is that I've exhausted every avenue I know of for achieving some kind of happiness. I've had therapy in the past, and while it helped, I don't think that will be a lasting solution. To move forward, I'll need to make some kind of radical life change because opportunities are not coming my way.",The feeling of exhausting every conceivable avenue for happiness...

But I've been dealing with these symptoms that I'm confident everyone experiences, but lately, these feelings have been more frequent and intense.  And I wanna make sure what I'm experiencing is normal and that it's something that'll pass.  Over the last 5-6months, I've been feeling more and more alone and easily replaceable by the people in my life. I'm not sure if this realization is more philosophical, or if it's an irrational feeling. Nonetheless, this thought really dampens my mood. I've also been losing interest and willpower to get through my schoolwork, practices, workouts, and social interactions. School and my athletics have been ingrained into me since I was 6 so I'm not sure if it's natural burnout or another irrational feeling. But, the main thing that's been messing with me is my memory seems to be gone and time seems to blur together. Every day is starting to feel the same and I can't remember when my GF and I went on a date. A date that happened 3 days ago, feels like it never happened until she brings it up and reminds me.  I've also been experiencing horrible sleep patterns.

2022-11-07 13:00:40,depression,"A son? A brother? A lover? A gifted young man gone awry? A fool who can’t seem to do anything but trip himself and close doors?

I’m all these and more. 

I’m a man who hates his vessel, a man who’s mind sabotages him in every endeavor. I am an enigma not even I can solve.

I shoot the light and curse the dark, I wonder why my life is in shambles when the blade that dices my future lays behind me bloody and discarded. And yet that same blade stays close for the next foolish hand that’s outstretched to pull me from my self made pit

Why am I this way? Why do I act this way? What is it about me that destroys all I’m offered. I don’t know if I’ll ever learn what part of me is the traitor. I can plead and cry and wail against myself night and day but it never changes. 

I hide the true hoard of emotion I hold with peerless performance. I hide my sadness, my struggle, my hate and endless rage against my maker for the woesome biological lot he dealt me. The people who hold me dear continually offer me words to the opposite, but their words ring deaf upon my ears. The fathomless disgust I feel can’t simply be my self perception alone can it? 

Maybe I’ve grown to used to believing what others say about me. I still hear them every now and then, the words of those who meant to tear me down. A cacophony of hate and spewed insults stuffed inside my head with no escape. There lives a snake formed by  a union of their hate and mine. A malevolent serpent that whispers horrible nothings into my mind before retreating his head once more into the depths of my psyche. A serpent that appears when I am defeated and on my knees, keen to edge me further and further towards the edge. 

I love myself, and yet I don’t. I love my family, I love my lover. And yet I can never see myself as they see me. Am I just a fool? Destined to hate myself while all around me love me? What a cruel trick it is that my mind will never allow me to truly be content as myself. How do I love myself fully? How is it even possible to change my perception of my body and soul so profoundly that I can enjoy being me? I want that so badly, I want to be the person all these people say I am. 

But then comes the question. How do I even know who I am anymore when I’ve hid and repressed so much from those I love? What’s really me? What’s the mask? I feel as if I’m made of papier-mâché, and ever layer you pull back is simply another self made ploy. A fake persona made to get you to stop worrying, to stop peeling away my walls and shield and accept the lie I give you. I don’t even know what’s at my core anymore, who is sitting at the middle of this padded cell that is my psyche? All I know is he’s scared and tired, and I don’t know how to make it better anymore. 

How does one even start to takes steps towards self contentment from where I am?",I’ve worn a mask for so long I don’t know who I am anymore

2022-11-07 12:55:20,depression,"Venting here before going to counciling. I need to I guess. I don't want to work anymore... I worked for so long at a miserable job and its just broken what little life I had left in me. I thought that after being made redundant I'd feel better after a little bit of time to readjust my mind and get some volunteer work done. Shop around for where to go for employment... yeah, what a ridiculous fucking notion. 

I'm just scared. Scared I end up in another wholesale shit-hole of a workplace... I can't do it again. I have no patience to deal with it. I'm so angry at how I was treated. My last employment was a shambolic mess of a work place. I have many picture examples of exactly how little effort the mangers and staff put in and what was left for me and the nightshift to deal with. A bitter as fuck stress-filled environment. Everyone there is miserable as fuck and they take pleasure in laughing at each others struggles, because you're struggles aren't theirs. So they get to enjoy seeing it. 

The kind of place that when I was being made redundant, during my ""redundancy consolation meeting"" the managers that ran it literally laughed in my face about how I ""need to get my life together before leaving"" 

For context I was transferred to the night shift from dayshift  because I was cutting on my arms through stress and depression. I had been on an obvious downturn mentally since my mother's death. Not that they ever seriously tried to talk to or help me.  They would ignore me as much as possible until I was literally in tears. Then I woukd get a half hearted ""talk"" with HR. I would never accept help from those CUNTS to be honest, they showed their lack competence at dealing with such things for years before hand with other members of staff. Who had been made to feel so miserable and not listened to they quit. I also just couldn't fucking take day shift anymore. The staff around me all just enjoyed bitching and laughing behind my back. Knowing they laugh at me and enjoy my struggles, really really stole what little confidence I had left about at least leaving that miserable shit-pit. 

In fainess its not like I was a model employee at all anymore. Especially after years of this treatment.

Watching the store managers face twist into a grin though, after what was said about getting my life together really hurt me. I just need a job but what is a job if not a drain on your happiness. Happiness that I just dont have. I think the concept of working a job i would actually enjoy is nothing but a flight of fancy. I dont want to be put into another similar situation and I'm so tired all the time now. I'm so sad. I just can't deal with this shit anymore. Why should I?... I tried hanging myself earlier this week. I dont have the justification in my head that I'm just stressed the fuck out from work anymore. 

It's not a case of reaching out to friends... I dont have any that don't want to snort cocaine. I can't do that shit. I won't come back from that. Why THE FUCK should I. I'm trying to stay away from booze as well. I've been off the drink for a while now I dont want to ruin that, but I feel helpless. No family want to help. I'm  the family fuck up. They just keep their distance and hiss about me when the think my back's turned. Deserved I guess. Why not check the fuck out. Why stick around to be in poverty.",It's about that time again.

I keep on making excuses not to try to date or make friends saying “I want to be happy and get better first” I don’t know if that’s the right decision or not. I just don’t want to meet someone from tinder and them pick up on my low mood, it’s exhausting having to fake my emotions all of the time. 

It’s been lonely not having any friends or romantic partners for 10 or so years fighting severe alcohol and weed addiction.

I hate drinking even though I do it every chance I get.  I've blown up so much of my life and lost so many people due to things I've done and said while intoxicated.  Yet I keep doing them.

I have nobody to talk to who understands.  I have a therapist but I feel like I'm wasting her time since I can't retain anything she says to me.  In one ear, out the other.

I don't have suicidal thoughts but I have fantasies of leaving where I currently am, except for the fact that I know I can't outrun things and would just end up this miserable no matter where I leave to.

I am tired.  So damn tired.  Time has gone by so fast and I've done nothing with it.  I've wasted every opportunity I've ever been given.  I've pushed away anybody who ever loved me (besides immediate family) and I just can't figure out how to do things right.

I hate myself.  I hate my life.  I hate how I've wasted 99% of every second I've been alive.  I feel like I owe everyone I've ever known a massive apology for burdening them with my existence.  

I'm so tired.  I'm so tired of not being able to change.  I wish so badly that I weren't like this so that I could actually do things that make me happy or that I'm proud of but I can't.  I'm living half a life.  I'm alive, but not living.  Every time I've ever tried to go out into the world I've left anyone involved with a bad taste in their mouth.  I quit everything I try because I know I make everyone uncomfortable and am noticeably worse at everything than everyone else.

I am rotting away and feeling so powerless to stop it.",There's something wrong with my brain

2022-11-07 11:29:38,depression,"I don't know what to say. If I'm being honest, truthfully, brutally honest, I wish I went through with my suicide attempt. I know that's something I guess people who are trying to get their life in order would say, but I don't know. There have been so many times I've wanted to do something, almost did, then backed out.

I'm such a fucking chicken I couldn't even go through with killing myself. And because of that, I don't feel valid. Because I'm surrounded by people who objectively have it worse than me, I can't complain about my problems. I've never been physically abused or sexually abused besides some sexual harassment. I don't think I've been mentally or verbally abused though that may be a gray area. Sure, I used to cut myself, but I don't anymore.

Sure, I could have killed myself, but I didn't. So shouldn't I be proud of myself for having the strength, unlike others? I really don't feel proud of myself which is a shit thing to say. But because I've been dubbed ""lucky"" by lots of people, I don't feel like I'm allowed to have problems. And because I technically didn't have a failed suicide attempt, I feel greatly invalid when it comes to suicide.

Trust me, I want to get better and all, but it's like not being to do all those things I was about to do is stopping me. Whether it be good or bad, I've been invalided my whole life by others and myself. How am I supposed to talk to others about my problems who've tried several times to kill themselves while I couldn't even try once? It's so fucking stupid, but I feel so fucking invalid.

I don't even know why I stopped, to be honest. I think it might have been because my ex drained me so much I just didn't have the energy. Calling the cops that night was a mistake. Even if I went through with it or not, calling the cops was not a good decision. And if I could go back to that night, I would have done it.

And that's where things get weird. I want to get so close to an experience but not complete it. Yes, I had the goal in mind to die that night, but the more I think about it. And the more I spend time with my girlfriend, it's more of: I wish I did it but lived just so I could feel validated in how I feel now. Even friends at school who blatantly said they've tried to kill themselves. It's so fucking invalidating honestly, but I can't say anything of that because it's fucked up to wish you did attempt suicide just to live.

I don't know if this will ever resolve. And while it makes me want to just try it, just one more time, but to see the next day, I know I can't. I already put my friends through enough, and my girlfriend has enough going on already. I couldn't ever leave knowing the amount of pain I'd leave. That doesn't stop me from every now and then wishing I did it.

And maybe that's why I let people rant to me. Or why I beg my friends and girlfriend to vent even if I know it'll trigger me. If I can't have the validation the way it was originally going to be then I'll find another way. And that way is being the therapist friend I guess. It's horrible, and some days I go over through all the things I've seen and feel god awful about it all. It both invalidates and validates me at the same time.

I know I should be happy, and that I'm luckier than others. I shouldn't be losing motivation if I have no reason to lose it. But hearing those people's trauma and the emotional toll it takes on me. Well, I guess that's my own way of self-harm. At least then, I can feel validated if I feel down. If I can get to a traumatic situation before others, especially my friends or my girlfriend, and stop it before they can see it then good. Even if it's fresh cuts or a pedophile, as long as others don't get traumatized by it, I'm fine with taking the hit.

Even if it's not real trauma or outright dumb, which it is, at least I can feel validated in some way. It's certainly not healthy, and I know that, but that's the only way I really know how. I'll be the test dummy for others to trauma dump on if it means my friends don't have to. And if others can feel better at the expense of my mental well-being then so be it.

I really wish I had gone through with it and lived. I've had that thought so many times, just so scared to die. And when I went to do it, I was ready somewhat. But my ex just had to fuck it up. I want to feel valid, and surviving a suicide attempt was my plan for it. Don't get me wrong, I didn't almost try for attention. I really did want to die, but the idea of getting better was I don't know. Regardless, it's stupid, and I'm stupid for ever thinking these thoughts.

I just want to feel valid, and I find that I feel valid through trauma. I'm sorry to everyone who reads this, especially my girlfriend. I don't want them to worry, and I truly am getting somewhat better. Just, it's not like I want to die anymore, I just want to feel valid. That's all.","I just want validation, and I know I'm shit for thinking this."

2022-11-06 16:54:16,depression,"Worried my brother will kill himself

My brother (35) has lived at my parents all of his life. He started trading from his room when he left uni and always hoped to make enough to buy a place and move out. Unfortunately that never happened and he’s still there, the trading is Forex Trading and in my opinion similar to a pyramid scheme or gambling - high stress and low reward. 

My brother has always been very secretive and it’s hard to get anything out of him, how he feels in life, if he’s ever had a girlfriend/boyfriend, what he is doing for money etc. I know he struggles from the few times I have managed to get him to open up over the years and he’s told me that he wouldn’t date because “why would I want people to see how decrepit my life is” and that he will be “40 years old with a life full of regrets”. I offered to help him look for a different job but he is very proud and doesn’t want my help.

My brother is really handsome, clever and charismatic. People would never imagine he lives the life he does because he puts up a very good front when he does meet people (at the gym) or his friends from school/uni. However he keeps his social circle very small, barely goes out of the house. He is clearly angry and this will show in the way he treats our mother, often snapping at her or being rude to her.

I work in mental health and have spoken to many individuals who have long term depression and clinical anxiety and I’m sure my brother has both. 

Summary: I love my brother and so want him to live a life he feels fulfilled with but he hates to be vulnerable and talk about his struggles. I have a horrible gut feeling he could end his life and I don’t know the best way to help him when he refuses to let me, or talk to me or anyone.

I contributed nothing to this society or planet so why should anyone ever care about me. 

I want to go missing for a little while to see if anyone will actually care for more than the first day of pretending. Or if I could watch everyone after I kill myself to see if they would really care if I was gone; kinda like It’s a Wonderful Life, the movie.

2022-11-06 16:21:09,depression,"I’m 26 and grew up in a very confusing family where I was constantly emotionally abused by every single adult in my family. My aunt sexually abused me when I was 14-18 years old and the effects of it are really hitting me now. Because I “willingly” went back to her when I was 18, my family won’t listen to me and still interacts with her. 
She has a big following on twitter in the furry community. That feels like it matters but it really doesn’t. 
My mom and I don’t talk anymore because that aunt is her sister. When I was younger, I remember (I have 2 half siblings on my moms side) she would just disappear for months and take my sister with her and my brother would live with my grandma, but for some reason no one wanted me. I was shipped from house to house, lived with my dad and stepmom for a while (I had 2 half sisters through him and my stepmom also). They didn’t really understand me and why I was so closed off and weird. I was 12 years old and my mom had been badly addicted to pills my entire childhood and I was neglected a lot, and my dad’s family is very “suburban soccer mom”. They constantly thought I was doing drugs but I was really just hiding and reading books and drinking too much monster energy and staying up with my best friend. They started physically abusing me. My stepmom would tell me I was nothing, I wasn’t her kid and the only reason I lived with them was because they had a legal obligation to take care of me. 

I met my husband when I was 19. Looking back, I feel I bonded with him because he was so kind and transparent. He’s 32 now. But I had just ended a relationship with my aunt and then been sexually assaulted and started a bad relationship with a man that surrounded me with party drugs before I met him. 

I’m just a bad person now I think. Nothing feels good anymore. I wish I hadn’t started drinking when I turned 21 because now I have a bad relationship with it. 

I’m broke, depressed, with no family support and no health insurance. I’m going to be evicted this week because I can’t pay my rent and my husband quit his job. I have to rehome my dogs. 

I even reached out to my mom but she won’t respond to me. I can’t bring myself to admit to my dad that I’m struggling so badly. 

I really think I’m going to end it. At this point , I don’t know how I can even keep going. I have nothing. I’m always going to be nothing. All of my siblings have family support and no one has ever loved me or wanted me.

With every direction I look in, I only see a reflection of how sad everything is in my life. These depressive thoughts hold my mind hostage, and won’t let it go not matter how hard I try.

Getting ready in the morning every day is nearly impossible. I’m just preparing for an another awful day to live. I am numb to all my thoughts, but I still know how bad everything is. I am used to be suicidal, It feels “normal”. I can’t imagine living without suicidal thoughts.  Do people actually live happy lives, and if so how do they do it? 

Only if it was easy to live, so many tasks and repetitive daily tasks, I can’t bear it. The world has nothing to offer when it comes to become happy. The only thing someone can do in this world is to slave away at a school / job to just survive. There are people who have friends to actually do stuff on the weekend with. I am lonely, I got nobody to laugh with, or talk too. I can only really spend time with my parents, but they are busy a lot. One really kind redditor also talks to me as well.

&amp;#x200B;

hello to anyone reading this, I am a 18 year old college student just wanting to let stuff out, I didn't have a great child hood, broken household, drugs, smoking and fighting was a common thing. my parents didn't have time for me most days would be me by myself, sometimes I would see my sister but most days I was extremely lonely. I remember during these times wanting my life to end, and at the age of 12 I tried killing myself, I felt like I lived with strangers, I didn't talk to ether of my parents nor did I think they cared about me. when I had tried to kill my self, my mom had opened her 12 year old's room to see me, in this moment I was frozen, she had cried and hugged me so much, as shellfish as it was, It felt amazing to finally have someone hug me, I felt like I was loved and wanted. after this, It was hard looking at my mom, face to face. since then I never let my emotions out what so ever, if something happened to me at school or if I was sad, I would just keep it too myself because I didn't want to be a burden on my mother. after that I vowed to never become this weak, but over these years things begin to get much harder, and harder. to this day I have never cried in front of my mom since then.  soon enough my dad would leave, so when I became the ""man of the house"" at 13. when my dad had left, my mom had to support me and sister by herself, and seeing her struggle working two jobs to support her kids, I know I had to do my best at home and at school. but looking back I gave up my childhood, I never got to spend time with any friends, I never got to play at parks or watch movies at the theatre, I never got to spend time with my mom. seeing my mom going to work, coming home eating and sleeping and then heading to work in the Moring killed me inside, she sacrificed all of her time for me and my sister, she never had time for herself, and yet she was okay with it all. I knew from a young age how much my mom had been put through, so this really made me feel strongly about not showing my weak side anymore, I didn't want my mom feel bad or worry for me anymore so I made sure that I always looked happy. sometimes I think back and wonder if it would have been better if I died that day, my mom wouldn't have to take care of us both and I wouldn't have to be dealing with life problems. but whenever i get sad I just turn music on and just cry into my pillow at night when no ones awake, because I feel embarrassed when I'm crying. the only thing that keeps me going at this point is my mom, my mom did what she did so that we had food and a roof over our heads, so ive promised to myself that I would make money so my mom could retire. I don't care if the job is hard, or weather or not its my passion, because at the end of the day my mom is everything to me. when I had gotten my first pay cheek, I took my mom and sister out to eat, it made me so happy, seeing her and my little sister eat at their favorite restaurant, it almost made me cry. I could finally start providing for my family, and it was amazing it gave me the feeling of being whole, and fulfilled. providing for my family is the only way im still alive today, and im thankful for having the chance to buy them things.","just wont to let stuff off my chest, just need to say/write something"

all of the problems and burdens of my family have been laid on me ever since i can remember. i’m not being cocky, but i honestly think that if it weren’t for me, my family wouldn’t be half as good as they are now. i’ve always been very level headed and mature while they’ve been the immature ones. my parents are so incompetent, that when my little brother got cancer, i had to move back home from my college to tend to my brother because no one was there for him. he passed away a couple years ago, and it honestly felt like i lost a child. i pretty much raised him, taught him, listened to him, cared for him and i lost him… 


flash coward to now, my parents are very successful thanks to a small business. my little sister and i are twelve years apart and she’s getting everything i never got the more mature parents, the stable financial status, the presence. i swear to god i saw my dad maybe once a week. yet despite my parents’ financial success, they’re still immature children who can’t see beyond their needs most of the time. they neglect my sister alot and so i find myself stepping into a mom role again; teaching her, feeding her, taking her to practice, helping her socialize so she doesn’t end up super shy like me. she seems to be the only person who sees how much effort and sacrifice i put into this family. i often skip opportunities to hang out with friends to tend to my sister and that’s always been a thing ever since i was parentified for my brother.



i have very little friends as i’m always worried about my family. i place my family’ needs above mine and i’m severely depressed. i always thought that deep down they saw all i did for them but i just got confirmation that they don’t. my dad pointed out “ you’re not a normal 23 ye old. you’re depressed because you want to be. you have nothing to be depressed about. get up and do something about the depression” 

i can’t believe they don’t see what years of trauma, parentification and the simple fact that they weren’t ready to have me has done to me.. this makes me want to drop all i do for them, move to a different city and make up for all of those years i wasted my youth in depression and helping my family out. i know now that they’ve never seen all i’ve done and they never will.",They will never see what I do for them

2022-11-06 13:43:46,depression,"I’ve been depressed for a lot of my life but recently it’s gotten worse. I used weed and alcohol to self medicate for a while but have been off for a month or so. I know that doesn’t help things either but I’m starting to think I’ll never get My brain back. It just gives out when I try to focus on or think about anything. It will take me days to think through something that used to take minutes or hours. 

The best way I can explain it is it’s like when you workout and your muscles just give out from fatigue. Thoughts just slip out of my mind while I’m trying to worth through something. This really concerns me because my intelligence has been the only thing going for me my whole life and now it’s all falling apart. I’m an idiot compared to how I used to be.

I don’t know how to make this better. I try to think about things and can’t no matter how I try. I try day dreaming but my mind goes blank in less than a minute. My memory is shot and I often have to try really hard to remember something. I sleep plenty. 8 hours a night plus 2-3 hour naps on the weekends if I feel tired. I eat ok. Better now than I used to. I try to go on short walks and get some sun as frequently as I can, but I have an office job so I could probably do better there. I drink plenty of water.

I just don’t have the motivation for anything anymore. I’m out of energy and have nobody to lean on. All my energy goes to surviving. I spend some time with coworkers after work 2-3 days a week but other than that don’t really have friends. I’m just at a point were working to be happy takes too much energy. I’ve always been the type who thought that when times get tough you just get yourself out of it the best you can but I can’t do it anymore. It’s not working and I don’t have the energy to try anymore. 

So I’m just kinda here existing. I don’t want to hurt myself, I just don’t have why it takes to get better. Life has just beat me down and I don’t have it in me to get up anymore.

For any who might ask, yes I’m going to therapy and no I’m not on any medication. I’ve tried it plenty in the past and it just doesn’t help.",I’m starting to think my brain will never come back.
2022-11-06 13:37:19,depression,"I failed my suicide attempt, and honestly I have been having mixed feelings of everything since then. People have been supportive and there for me but my own emotions are really making me struggle. 

On one hand, I feel like I'm fine and that me making the choice to stop before it was too late was okay, but on the other I feel guilt, shame and almost like I should of gone through with it. Since then, I've felt very confused on my purpose on life and even more so feeling like I'm not in control and losing purpose in my life, in a way I feel like giving up again because I don't know what to do or feel, especially since I'm more scared of my future and what's going to happen to me now.

I did talk to a professional mental health resource of what I can do, but honestly I don't want to be institutionalized, I don't want to be stigmatized either if I tell my family, and I think my medication failed and therapy isn't helping. I don't know how to feel or what to do.","I failed my attempt, I'm not sure how to feel, process or what to do after what happened."

Has anyone been able to find a way to ensure that your next of kin and family isn’t contacted in the matter of if you were to take your life into your own hands? 

My father is dead. My mom is mentally deranged and disowned me 9 years ago, as well as the rest of her family. 

The rest of my family has become bizarrely self-absorbed and dreadfully callous and inhumane, particularly so when it comes to a family member being near death or after their passing. They treat it as a nuisance.

If I were to end things, my biggest concern would be that I would not want law enforcement to contact any next of kin or family member (all way out of state) as they would only feel incredibly burdened by the news and enormously resentful at having to take care of any of my after death clean up or estate affairs. 

Has anyone here been able to figure out how to appoint a company of sorts to handle your body removal, home clean up and estate distributions (none of which would be to a family member)? 

I literally don’t even want a single member of my family contacted at my possible passing. None of them would ever even realize it until maybe 2-3 years down the road anyway.

It’ll sound corny, but I love the show “The Office” the American TV show. My favorite quote and something that I often think about is “""I wish there was a way to know you were in the good old days before you actually left them.""

I’m having a hard time moving on. I can’t escape my hometown, I work in my old childhood mall where I would spend my time with my friends- visit familiar places that I have so many memories at. But it’s just empty.

These people are all gone, either moved away or lost contact with. I moved out because my parents moved pretty far away and I didn’t want to leave this place. 
But that isn’t home, this place isn’t home,  this room doesn’t feel like home… and I don’t know anyone here anymore…

I see people laughing and smiling in places I used to hang out with my friends- and I’m just jealous.

I should be grateful for today, i use to be grateful for everyday- I had acknowledged that there will be hard times and good times.

But god I wish i had friends. I wish I had people to experience the world with. To talk too. I even miss having people to come home too, or having people miss me when i leave. 

Usually i can distract myself from this feeling. But it’s a Saturday night and everyone is posting their night outs having fun and I’m sitting here in my mess of a room that I’m just too exhausted to pick up.

I don't know what's wrong with me. Maybe nothing, maybe if you knew my whole life you would totally feel me but probably not. 

The option is always there honestly sometimes I think the only thing that keeps me here is not making my family sad, they are wonderful people. I don't believe in god but I've prayed I would get sick and die so I couldn't go out not by my own hand

I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety at the age of 14 and went on a trial of multiple medications till I found one that worked for me.

Fast forward to now, age 26…

I have many sleepless nights over the fact that I don’t know who I truly am anymore. 
What would I be like without the medication or even a different one?
I feel like I’m a zombie.
Don’t get me wrong, the medication has saved me and I am still able to feel emotion to a certain degree but I feel like I’m just not ME and I’m curious to know who I am now.

I have wealthy parents who both have high ranking jobs in financial fields and I live in an expensive, modern apartment building on the riverside in a nice neighborhood. I go to nice trips and I overall have a lot of luxuries that upper/upper-middle class have and I would consider myself a gifted and smart and analytical person. All this being said, I fucking hate this shit. I feel like everything is just a pile of shit. And I feel like I don’t have the right to since I live such a privileged life. 

I didn’t get into the school I wanted after elementary school and went to a zone school for 6th and most of 7th, and there it was just a fucking waste of my damn time and I barely did any homework nor did I make friends and have any fun experiences. It was so miserable. I transferred to my current school in late 7th and now am in the same school in 8th, and it is definitely an improvement from last year but I still feel so empty. My friends situation is weird since everyone there knows each other well and I feel awkward when I hang around others who are really close, and I just don’t feel that comfortable there as I would with my old friends that I’ve known since I was little. And not only is school bad, but I don’t do jack shit at home either. I’m studying for an upcoming highschool exam and I practice guitar I guess but that’s all the “good” things I do. Aside from that I just walk around in circles and play autistic ass roblox games and watch depressing tv show, so basically I just do absolutely nothing. Other kids are doing all these sports and have events and see their friends after school but when I get home I just lay on my bed and sigh and look at social media and see everyone else being so much happier than me.

But for my gf and my friends I said I needed to stay positive. So after my gf being sick for 3 days and me not seeing her she came back to school on Thursday ( we had Friday off) and after me planning on having a great weekend broke up with me for what she said was she just doesn’t feel like having a relationship rn. And asked if we could be friends. She kinda just left it there with me saying ok and walking off. The next day (yesterday) it finally started hitting me that she felt had broken up w me and we were done. So I went to hang w my friend to take my mind off of it. When I got home I came back to my parents arguing again for the 5th time this week. I had enough and basically said for them to just stop arguing because it’s fucking stupid. My dad grabbed me and basically screamed that I’m the reason they fight with him walking away basically saying they should just divorce. Plus they both just lost their jobs and we are barely making ends meet and will prob have to move as we are running out of money. And just to top it all off with all of that my grades were suffering so I’ve been pulling all nighters for the past week just to get grades up. So yea I’m a tad stressed just needed to get it out somewhere. ( I’m 15 btw)",Idefk

I feel extremely alone, i’ve worked with a therapist this past year and i have tried to open up to my mother but she has so much on  her plate it always works her up and it isn’t good for her health. outside of her the only person (this is not an exaggeration because i have no friends anymore) i can open up to is my boyfriend. but it is an abusive relationship we have both been toxic to each other. right now i am trying to fix things but he doesn’t trust me anymore so he has outbursts and breaks things off on and off. my dad is not around anymore he left and blocked me on everything. i feel a burden to my mom. my grandparents love me but i cannot burden them with the full extent of my suffering mental health. right now i am in my room and ready to do it. i feel so alone that no one can understand me and just simply that i have no one i can talk to",i am really struggling rn
2022-11-06 11:43:18,depression,"I'm listening to some music I like, and I felt the urge to share it with someone. But then I realized I had no one to share it with. Particularly, a person who would care. Who would say something more than ""That's cool. It sounds nice."" Someone who put in effort. Who made me feel heard. The music is analogous of all aspects of my life. In general, I don't think people would care whether I was here or not. Maybe some people cared about me, like my mother, but she doesn't understand me. I just wished I had one person who made me feel heard and understood. I feel like desperation inside like I'm lacking something or someone, but I can't do anything about it. It's not sadness; more so, it's like an urgency. I just need to do something.",Lack close friends.

My brain is just foggy all day, I have moment when it clears up throughout the day but it disappears.

I don’t know why I’m depressed. I make a lot of money, am attractive and can be driven but it all feels empty.

I kind of just want to end it. I don’t really see the point to anything. I have erratic behavior, I put myself in dangerous situations to feel something, I’m probably addicted to sex as a way to show that there’s some value in me as a human being.

I don’t know this is just an incoherent rant, like yelling into the void. No one here can help or do anything and that’s why I’m willing to talk. Anyways going to go lay in bed and waste another day.

I have a good job in my chosen field. I have a great husband and family. I have stable housing and income. So much to be grateful for. Three years ago I really started taking my mental health seriously after realizing most people don't spend their days dreaming about suicide. 

I've done cognitive behavioral therapy, tried 4 antidepressants, and am currently trying bio-identical hormones after learning I have very low progesterone levels that may be contributing to my mood and fatigue. I have periods of good mental health but it always seems to come back to depression. 

It feels like no matter what I do or what I try, I will return to a depressed state. I am so tired of it. I want to be well. I want to not feel like a burden.

I was brushing my teeth, just listening to music when a song came on, House of Gold by Atreyu.

It's been more than two years since we broke up, I shouldn't still love her. She did absolutely terrible things to me, I shouldn't regret the fact that I sent her mom all the evidence of her cheating, causing them to cut contact with her and her her kicked out of the religious school we were both in, but I do.

2022-11-05 16:19:29,depression,"So, I (17m) had been dating this girl (17f) for a little over a month. She’s amazing, and sweet, and kind, and funny. I really like her. I wouldn’t say I’m in love but I have love for her, if that makes sense. I understand that seems a little fast, but we just click really well. In the beginning she felt the same. However, as time progressed, she lost feelings, which she had warned me about. You see, she had a really rough childhood and had gone through an abusive father and stepfather. She lives with her mom and grandparents now, so she’s out of those situations thank god. But, her grandparents can be pretty mean, based on what she’s told me. I’m saying this because I feel like all that caused her to put up some mental walls. She doesn’t want to be hurt again. She said she’s lost feelings for exes in the past, so I’m not the first person. I’m no therapist though, so it’s only a guess based on my own experience and knowledge. On top of that, she suffers from hypothyroidism, which basically her thyroid is under active, leading to lower metabolism and depression in her case. I feel like that definitely also affects it. I also feel like some of the other things previously mentioned may have also caused depression and this just builds on it. She has been caught self harming before, by her grandma. However, her reaction was simply not caring, and god I hate that for her. Now, she does have a therapist/psychologist, but they’re not good. They’ve probably only contributed to the problem based off of what she’s told me. For example, they put her on a diet when she said she wasn’t happy with her body (partially a symptom of the hypothyroidism). This only gave her an eating disorder. There were other instances but this is the major one. I’ve suggested asking to switch to a different therapist, but she isn’t comfortable bringing that up with her grandma. In any case, I don’t know what to do about our relationship. Either way, I know I’ll be there for her. I’d prefer to be there as a boyfriend, but I’d gladly be there as her best friend too. We’ve broken up, with the idea that maybe we can try again later when she’s figured herself out. She wants to love me, because she thinks I’m a really good guy and wants to have romantic feelings for me like I do her, but currently she doesn’t, although she does really care for me. I don’t know what to do. Any advice/help would be really appreciated. I’ll post answers to questions if needed.

2022-11-05 16:12:30,depression,"I don't know what is going on with me. i'm feeling all alone , nervous , insecure.

i think i'm going through some sad depression thing. or maybe i know what is happening.

I got close to a girl in past 1 year. she was the one who kept asking me on dates.

things were all good and fine . Until she joined a university as a student.

I proposed to her , but she said no. she said she cant do it but she will give the more thousand times love . she begged me to stay in her life , she said she will be my best part in my life . I knew i was getting friend zoned . but a part of me also just wanted to stay with her and i even cant leave that time . this was my biggest mistake.

things were normal for few weeks . later she started to mention about the guys she liked. she got a guy student in the university . she used to tell me how good he is and how close they have come together . it was hard for me . she called me when ever she needed help . when ever she needed money , or when ever she needed help with her assignments.  i just couldn't say no. 

things started to change soon , they both went on dates like we used to do before.

and she used to share their pics with me. i know i was just a friend and couldn't do anything about it. but soon i told her i don't want to listen about how she feels about that guy. i had seen him , he is handsome  and rich too. 

when i told her that i didn't want to her about their relationship no more , she said what if we became too close and i didn't let you know a bit. 

i know what she meant 

i didn't expected her to change this much and i know she is not same again

. i was always there for her

every time i chose to stay , it was getting harder to leave .

&amp;#x200B;

i think i'm going through some sad depression thing. or maybe i know what is happening.

I got close to a girl in past 1 year. she was the one who kept asking me on dates.

things were all good and fine . Until she joined a university as a student.

&amp;#x200B;

I proposed to her , but she said no. she said she cant do it but she will give the more thousand times love . she begged me to stay in her life , she said she will be my best part in my life . I knew i was getting friend zoned . but a part of me also just wanted to stay with her and i even cant leave that time . this was my biggest mistake.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

things were normal for few weeks . later she started to mention about the guys she liked. she got a guy student in the university . she used to tell me how good he is and how close they have come together . it was hard for me . she called me when ever she needed help . when ever she needed money , or when ever she needed help with her assignments.  i just couldn't say no. 

&amp;#x200B;

things started to change soon , they both went on dates like we used to do before.

and she used to share their pics with me. i know i was just a friend and couldn't do anything about it. but soon i told her i don't want to listen about how she feels about that guy. i had seen him , he is handsome  and rich too. 

&amp;#x200B;

when i told her that i didn't want to her about their relationship no more , she said what if we became too close and i didn't let you know a bit. 

i know what she meant 

&amp;#x200B;

i didn't expected her to change this much and i know she is not same again

. i was always there for her

2022-11-05 15:51:10,depression,"So all my life I feel like I've been unlucky and unloved. I'm currently 20M and I'm seriously wondering what to do. 

When I turned 11, I was promptly kicked out of my house to stay with my grandmother because I got into a heated argument with my uncle living with my parents, siblings and I. He wanted me to stop eating because I was a chubby kid (admittedly I've only grown) and I finally had enough of his badgering and scolded him. My parents stepped in and scolded me. They didnt feel like I had a right to ask him to stop. I stayed there for a year before being allowed back. 

For years on end, I would end up in a serious arguments with my parents because of disagreements in the house. Some ranged from me being upset at the table to one time I was sharing horror stories with my sister (her 14 and I 16) that made her cry. I was made to kneel and beaten. 

I've also had the worst luck with friends. I was never allowed to go over to friend's houses for any reason. It didn't help that I was socially unaware. Everyone was an acquaintance. Me unknowingly coming out did not help. I liked a boy in my class and didn't know what gay was so I told the person seating near me and my whole year ended up finding out about it. It got the guy some teasing and ultimately I was bullied for it. He really ended up hating me. It carried onto high-school because I was with the same people. It didn't help that in the first year, I followed a senior cause I looked up to him and got the whole year of his to bully me. It spread to the extent of teachers bullying me throughout my school life. They even made fun of the little friends I made that I only had 1-2 friends by the time I graduated. 

I fell into depression and so I started sleeping around with men since 14. I catfished that I was older. I didn't care who it was. Married or not. I was very literally just a hole or warm mouth. I finally fell in love with a emotionally unavailable guy I met online. He was not short of cruel. He invited me and another guy to his birthday party and left me and his friends with the guy to the nearby forest for an hour. His friends literally stared me up and down before I finally cried and left. Sadly I continued trying to meet him till he finally blocked me. As any toxic person, I tried to contact him every few months telling him I miss him. Then I met an older guy. Totally put together except for his romantic life. He was newly bi so I was his confident for that area. I fell in love with him but didn't say anything till I got gaslighted into confessing. I eventually had to cut him off because I had two suicide attempts. 

Now I found a toxic guy who is emotionally immature and unavailable to date. He actually wanted me. But he cheated on me the first month into the relationship. I cheated on him with the first guy (my body was the only thing he liked). I got abused by my bf for a long time. Talking to other people and lying about everything. He's much stronger than me so you can imagine what else happened. Yet because my self worth is so little, I'm just staying with him because I don't think I'm worth any love. I got into an argument with my mom because of him and had to move out. She even yelled: ""Cursed is the day you were born!"" to me. I think I deserve it.

If anyone has any advice that seriously helps people lose weight, get their ugly self together and how to stop this toxic cycle, please share. I'm so tired of life. I need some support. I'm so evil and I don't know how to stop",I feel like evil's sidechick

Luckily his roomate arrived before it was too late to get the pills out of his stomach. I am fucking terrified and just want him to be okay. 

I thought he was dead for at least 20 minutes while I was driving to his house... I can't shake that feeling that he actually tried to do it. I know he was in a rough patch after his girlfriend ended their relationship but I never thought he was at this point.

I get really motivated to do better sometimes but then I remind myself that I’m a failure and I shouldn’t bother trying with anything. I can’t make new friends because I’ll end up pushing them away anyways. My relationship with my family is bad because mental health issues aren’t real to them. I feel like I can’t talk to anyone because I don’t want to trauma dump or make it seem like I’m crazy or anything. I’ve tried going to a therapist before but they didn’t really help and I’m too scared to go to another one because I’m paranoid about too many people knowing about all my problems.

In December of 2020, I was r**** and for awhile, my mental health was quite bad once I pieced together what had happened to me, as I was unconscious when the person I met on Tinder r**** me and roofied me. About two months later, I met an amazing guy (let’s call him A). Through work. I’ve never gotten along with someone as well as A, and it all happened naturally, my first thought with A was never forced. 

However, my mental health declined rapidly, and for awhile, I couldn’t go a day without thinking about tying a noose around my neck and just ending it all because what happened to me was just so painful. I’m better now, and I’ve gotten therapy, but because of how messed up I was, I let A go. It was very, very hard, but I believe it was the right decision.

I had someone tell me recently that what I did was a selfless act, and I know this isn’t exactly asking for advice, but I only feel comfortable opening up on here. When I think about A, I just want A to be happy. I want him to be his own person, and at the time, I knew A wouldn’t fix or solve my problems. 

Thanks for listening to me.

I won't ever accomplish anything other than being slightly below average. I work a useless dead-end job that a peanut could perform. I don't have any special talents or skills. I have no motivation to be better. I couldn't be better if I tried.

No help from anyone. And he uses said degree to get him some nice-paying jobs. Ones that he could actually build a career out of.

Yesterday, I (male 18) cut myself 11 times on my left forearm. I'm not proud of it, but the knife looked so attractive at the time. I was in the depths of pain at the time and my only outlet was cutting myself. It's the only thing that took my mind off the pain and I'm ashamed but I liked it. It felt good at the time but now I'm even worse. It's my own insecurities and an inferiority complex pushing me towards self-harm and I'm starting to hate myself more and more with each passing day. When I compare myself to my best friend (male 17), let's call him Nick, I just start feeling worse and worse. Nick's advancing further and further and further and further while I'm stuck in the same spot. We met in 7th grade and were basically the same person. But now that we're both seniors, he's entirely different. He's confident, handsome, fit and attractive. He's had a rough spot too, and even tried to commit suicide by hanging himself. I had no idea what he was going through at the time, and knowing now just tears me up. But he's gotten much better since then. He's had like 6 girlfriends in the span of our friendship and I've had none. Recently, Nick met a girl that he really likes who likes him and I couldn't be happier for him. But my jealousy burns and it eventually turns to rage. He's noticed and it's hurting our relationship. All the girls I've tried to talk to ghosted me, so it's not really good for my confidence. Do I blame them? Not really. I'd do the same in their shoes. I don't think anyone deserves to have to deal with me. But recently, he lost his virginity. I still have mine. I know it's not healthy to romanticize sex that much, but I always thought I'd get rid of mine first. He's younger than me by half a year so that's another slap in the face. It's pathetic, but having sex was actually my main goal for most of my teenage life, but now that he's accomplished my life's goal unknowingly before me, I feel listless. So knowing that he's ahead of me again just kills me. I don't know why I compare myself to others, especially him, so much. It hurts. I need help. I don't want others to worry for me. I don't matter at all. I never have and never will, and while I don't like it, I accept it sort of. But I've affected my friends in a bad way. I really don't want to ruin my friendship with Nick because we're basically brothers. We've been through thick and thin and have always been there for each other. But because of me and my stupid feelings, I've been straining the relationship hard. I try to hide it from my family for the most part because I don't want them to worry. But I've been finding it hard to care about anything recently. I just don't care anymore. I could die and I wouldn't care. I actually told Nick that I cut myself and he was scared. I didn't like that so I tried to lighten the situation but that just made him mad. I don't want him to feel those things because he's already been through a lot. For the record, I'm not in love with him. I like women, at least I'm pretty damn sure. So the stuff I say about him are from a viewpoint of brotherly love. I love him, but I'm not IN love with him. Sorry, I went on a tangent. A couple days ago, I saw him texting one of our friends about me. I was literally in the worst anger I'd ever been in then. I thought he betrayed my trust and didn't think anything good of me. I was plotting ways to end our friendship because I was SO angry. But we talked it out and it turned out to be a misunderstanding. After that, I felt so much better, and we're talked for hours about everything, some about the sex, but mostly just about life. I learned a lot about him that day. I've never felt so close with someone in my life. We opened up about basically everything and it felt  good. Just opening up and getting everything off my chest. But when I'm alone in my room, with just the silence as my companion, the voices return. The ones that use my voice telling me that I'm worthless and don't deserve love. I just don't know what to do anymore. I won't do therapy unless it's forced upon me because I don't want to upset my family. I won't kill myself because that will make others sad and I wouldn't like that. I've been in constant mood swings recently and I go from barely functioning to a silent ball of anger, depression, and terrible thoughts. I know I might never be okay, but I want to be. I miss when I didn't worry about anything. Now I have to worry about college and what I'm going to do with my life. All of the stress is building and my chest always hurts these days. I just don't want to break the one relationship that's holding me together. I don't know how to put I feel for Anni into words. But I'll try. Love, jealousy, pride, anger, respect, and pain. The emotions are always in constant flux, one always coming out on top.

But enough of that. I just need to know what to do. I'm scared I'm going to ruin everything.",I Cut Myself

So I may need a slap in the face to bring me back to relative sanity on political matters and your general views are welcomed. This has been in my mind everyday for 6 years now. It eats me from the inside.

So,  I am not a US citizen, but I live in Canada. Anyway, below is my constant back and forth in my head...

The   last few years have  been stressful for some (lots) of us up here and I   may be reading too much history and doom forecasting, but I sometime   find myself afraid of  what could happen if, for example, Trump and the   GOP get their ways.  Among all the things the US citizens could go   through, I fear that the relationship between both our countries could   deteriorate and that Canada could be another proverbial Poland.

But   then, and discussing this with friends and colleagues, we catch   ourselves thinking that this is not the same as 1930's as, clearly, half    of the USA would not go for stuff like that (like both coasts which   are the big economic powers). We also think that if for some reason,    economic instability would happen, the party in power would not be able    to sustain whatever policies they wish to put forth, especially if  they   are crazy. We've seen people go down in the street and its one  thing  to  get ""power"" but keeping it is another.

Basically,    in my rational time, I think that I may be overthinking this, but   then, when we hear the GOP basically saying MAGA stuff, stoking hard  right ideologies... I fear it  could spill  over into international  relations towards something bigger.

Ultimately,    I can't foresee the day when New England friends and other reasonable    Americans and their military would seek to impose ideologies by  threat  of force on old friends... but it is a present thought in my  head.

Slap  me and bring some  sense into me? I know I am worrying too much and I  wish I could be  carefree about this, but for some reason its just been  present since  2016. I was really not into American politics back then  but since, I  know way much more than I'd like to!","Been stressed, depressed because of politics anxiety... need a slap in the face..."
2022-11-05 12:23:42,depression,"Hello everyone I'm new here. I recently came back from a suicide attempt. I jumped off a bridge. Didn't even break a bone. The saddest park is that... when I hit the water... finished drowning splashing around and was able to catch my words felt the cold water submerge me... the first thing out my mouth was. ""Damn I was hoping I'd die instantly."" I've felt this was for years.... no matter what.

Even in my happiest moments. Especially when I'm viewing something beautiful. It's right then and there where I want to die most. I'd go on a beautiful hike to view nature in its true glory and my first thought would be. ""This is the perfect spot to die."" 

I can't talk to anyone about how I'm feeling because they don't listen... or they just tell me it'll get better or that I shouldn't feel that way. But I really do feel so at peace when I think about death. When I was falling off that bridge I remember smiling... I cried because I lived... then when the police started talking to me from above I remembered blocking them out because I felt like such a disappointment I couldn't even commit right.

The rescue boat pulled me up and all I could think was ""Wow these people are good at their jobs"" then they had to rip off my soaked freezing clothes because I floated in the water for 30 minutes... they cut my favorite jacket apart to save me yet I was still only upset I survived. 

I have a girlfriend and she was worried about me... crying throwing up, not eating and everything because she really was that worried about me. I can't even make suicide jokes around her anymore without her smacking me in my mouth. 

I deserve that.  But I really do wish I had died on that bridge when I finally built up the courage to jump. Because no matter how happy I am in a moment there's always that thought lingering in the back of my head about the perfect death.",I always want to die...But I feel it most at my happiest moments.
2022-11-05 12:21:41,depression,"I can’t stay at home, but I can’t move out. Any option would only lead to discontent, I think.

Background story:
I (18 f) met my best friend (19 f) about 6 years ago on the internet. We were able to safely meet, and we’ve been platonic soulmates ever since. We both still live at home, which means we’re a couple of states away. Recently, she’s gotten a job that takes up more time than anything in the past and it’s killing me. Love is hard because when you love someone so deeply and passionately, you’re going to rely on them heavily. She’s been responding less and less and hasn’t been able to visit as frequently, but has assured me that she still wants to follow through with our plans (she will move in with me and then we will both move out together) and that she loves me all the same and i believe her, but i’ve had so many people silently leave me and every day that goes by without a response kills me. All this to say, she was able to come and visit me last week! Things were going as planned until we got the new that we could not go back to my house because my father had covid. We stayed with friends and in an airbnb for a bit. One thing i need in order to remain stable is my bedroom, as it is my place to safely recharge, so it’s safe to say that this past week has really fucked me up. On tuesday, i had a really intense anxiety attack. Luckily, she was able to help me out of it, but i had another one during my therapy session that last for about an hour. I haven’t felt the same since. I always have issues when i know she has to leave soon (her flight was scheduled for wednesday night) but this was different.

Another bit of context:
Lately i’ve been feeling so incredibly burnt out with life. I’ve been feeling like i have been placed in the wrong timeline and that i need to move on to the next stage of my life or else i will die. The issue is that i have no clue what to do. I know what I want to do with life, but my best friend (mentioned above) is not ready to move out yet and i can’t do it without her (i need a roommate and i know i mentally could not handle living with anyone else) I feel like i can’t keep living at home but i don’t know how i’d be able to move out.

Current story/question:
After the units anxiety attack on tuesday, all of these feelings of dread about staying where i currently am in life have exploded within me. i feel like the only people i can talk to are my best friend and my therapist. i’ve basically locked myself in my room (father has recovered from covid so i am back at home) and told my mother that i need space for a while. i just feel devoid of any feelings and absolutely exhausted with my life, i need a change so desperately, but i don’t know what that change could be. i’ve brainstormed a couple of options, but none of them make me happy. i don’t see myself being happy with any of the end results with all of the scenarios i’ve come up with. i suppose my question to everyone here is how do i go on with life when i feel so empty, but more importantly, what the fuck do i do with my life? do i stay here and suffer through everything ( i don’t know how long it will be until i can move out with my best friend, hopefully a year or less) or do i find a way to break free and possibly waste my savings on something that could be even worse for me. please help. i just feel so lost and numb and it’s not healthy for me to keep dumping this all on my best friend. i feel helpless.",I feel trapped with no way out.

Its so hard, its like ive chattered for the first time and nobody is there to pick up the pieces. I was broken, like i can't fit things back the same. I cant approach people the same.

I wanna fuck them over so bad, put theit fucking ego in its place. How can someone be so fucking heartless. how can you look in their eyes and see nothing but fucking rage. It dont fucking matter to me, only reason it matters is becs i let them in and in and they know my weaknesses. For some time it worked. They were able to use the weakness, and it didnt matter if i can see right through it, its a weakness after all. Until it didn't. Now they mean nothing to me.

2022-11-05 12:20:23,depression,"This thought helped me with my depression. First I want to say I’m not completely recovered but I can manage my life better now. And have not hit rock bottom for a good while ever since I understood this: 

Life requires action. You can influence your life by the actions you make. Become aware that your only power is the power of choice. Start with small choices that will help you achieve your goals. And then when you feel comfortable move to bigger actions. It worked for me because I was depressed that my life was shitty. I solidly believe that god had to fix my life for me. So I didn’t take the actions that were needed in order to influence my life to my desired life. I evaluated my life and made changes according to the outcomes I would like to have. I started small. First changing my “the universe will provide it.” With “I will move towards it.” It’s been rewarding for me and I hope it can be eye opening for people in the same situation.",This helped me reduce my depression immensely

2022-11-05 11:54:04,depression,"I don’t even know where to start. Around 6 months ago I moved to a different state with my family, and every second here has been an emotional roller coaster. Before moving here I guess things were moderately okay, but now… this is the saddest I’ve been in years. 

So I’m 21 M, and I guess the way I feel comes down to me being and feeling extremely lonely, I’ve kinda felt this way as far back as I can remember. I have a job, I have hobbies that I indulge in often, and I live with my mom so for the most part I get to spend my money pretty freely, and it’s always been this way even before we moved. I have been trying my hardest to make friends and make connections here but it truly doesn’t feel like I fit in here &amp; the people don’t want me around. I’m originally from a busy city and we moved to the south so the pace and how people act is very different from what it was at home. 

This post actually has very little to do with my move, I just believe it’s what’s triggering what I’m feeling now. About two months ago I met this girl. We hit it off and things were going very well, there were some things we had to iron out before we started to get more serious, but in the end we got through those trivial hurdles. While we were trying to maneuver through those hurdles she was very adamant about wanting to be with me and even cried at the thought of us not being together. So I get to put a title on it and then she all of a sudden no longer wants the connection and relationship we’ve built. I was very upset, and hurt, especially because she was the first and only person I connected with here in this new state. This happened a while ago and I’m still angry and sad about it. 

See I think this has very little to do with the girl. Growing up I never had any real friends. I never fit in, I was always bullied and my dad was absent for large chunks of my life. I was never wanted as a kid by my peers in school and I wasn’t wanted by my father either. I’m 21 now, I’m attractive, have goals, financially responsible, I’d even go as far to say that I’m pretty funny too. It still feels as though my dad wants nothing to do with me, despite my efforts to make him proud and want me as a son, all of the friends I’ve made in the recent years have just used me in some way and don’t truly value me as a person. No matter how good I treat a woman they decide that I’m not worth their time and they throw me to the curb… I’m just extremely tired of feeling like I am not wanted outside of my mother. It’s so heart breaking to want genuine friendships and romantic relationships just for it to all go to shit. 

I’ve worked on myself in every way possible for me during the time I haven’t had anyone around and I still can’t manage to form a bond with anyone. I have all of these nice things. Dope gaming setup, a pretty fun &amp; quick sports car, nice clothes etc… but none of it matters because of how much I’m craving genuine attention and friendship from another human being. I just bought a PS5 last week. I was so excited after setting it up that I wanted to call someone and show them on FaceTime, sadness quickly followed after I realized I had no one to share my excitement with…

It feels trivial typing this all out because it doesn’t seem that deep after reading it. I’m not the best at expressing the way I feel but I’m so tired of hurting. My chest literally aches as I type this. I’m not looking for any solutions on any of what I typed. This isn’t the first time I’ve been here and I’ve gotten all the advice I can get.

2022-11-05 11:35:02,depression,"I’m going to hang myself from an old exercise machine in my garage. I am horribly bipolar and my depression will never stop creeping back up no matter how well I feel. It always will come back. I can’t get into seeing a doctor, I can’t take any more antidepressants because the feel good is short lived. I can’t stop bouncing from job to job because of my anxiety and mood swings, I just can’t keep this up. I love my family but I can’t hurt them anymore. Luckily I haven’t started one of my own, I’ve got no significant other, no children, the pain this could cause anyone will be short lived. They’ll move on and I’ll just be some man in the family pictures, “Look, that’s Joey.” I have hurt for so, so long, I’ve passed that pain onto others so many times. This is the right thing to do. I know that I’ll never be able to have what others have because I am sick. It’s not my fault that I’m this way, but it’s my responsibility, and I’m going to do something about it.

So I have a friend with benefits, and he makes it clear that he sees other women. He's the guy who likes to sleep around, and I respect that. One night when he was drunk, and I think he was hanging out with another girl, he started calling me multiple times. I told him I would see him later in the night, but he kept begging and begging to see me and kept calling and calling. So I went to see him and slept with him, and during it, he was telling me that he loved me and looking down at me and telling me multiple times that he loved me. I was lying there staring at him because I didn’t know what to say. He then was like grabbing me later and telling me he never wanted me to leave.

The following day though, he acted like oh, I don’t know how he got home last night, or oh, I don’t know why I left so early, so I didn’t take what he said. I think he was upset that he left the other girl early. The last time I saw him, we hung out and drank a bit. We are fooling around a little bit and going at it several times. The last time we were having sex, I was massaging him, and he whispered to me I love you. I didn’t call him out about it, but it makes me feel weird about the relationship.

  I’ve got some very steep walls built up. I don’t feel connected to him at all. I don’t feel seen or heard. I’m suffering from depression and I try to communicate these dark feelings of actually fantasizing about falling asleep and not waking up again. I explain in detail how crippling the pain is of everything that’s happened but he is disconnected from my emotions.

  I have childhood trauma from around 15 years ago. I try to talk to my husband about this. He feels I should be over the sexual abuse after all this time. He feels I “choose to hang onto” the hurt. Its my fault I’m hurting and not the abusers’. It’s my fault I feel this way for not being able to let go. 
  I can cry to the point of shaking and he actually seems annoyed. I told him I feel so alone. He basically said, “after everything I’ve done for you?” (Mainly financial things. He is the breadwinner and I care for our special needs children. I feel very unfulfilled not having a career or life of my own).
  I have strange sleep cycles. I can be so tired I sleep for days when he’s home. I’m so so tired. A tired that feels like more than exhaustion. It’s like hibernating haha. Then I can go weeks where I can’t sleep at all. 
  I feel like there is no hope. I feel like even when this marriage is finally over, I’ll never be whole again. I’ve lost all self confidence in this relationship. I’ve got no family or friends. I have no support system. I feel like I’m drowning. I want to disappear. I want to be someone else. I want to lay down and just sink into the ground.

2022-11-04 14:47:49,depression,"Hello.

I put out a post yesterday asking if you would be interested in an update to my situation I posted about two months ago and since most of you posted that you are interested, here is the update for you. If you don't remember my original post, I suggest reading it first to understand my situation.

Link of post describing my situation [https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/xlq1e5/depressing\_situation\_guidance\_needed\_for\_fixing/](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/xlq1e5/depressing_situation_guidance_needed_for_fixing/)

I guess this update will be a little long so I hope you bare with me.

I will admit I was very nervous about trying to reach my sister. I gave her such a hard time over the last few years and she is really the only family I have, so I was very scared about her maybe not forgiving me because then I would have had no one. I kept having nightmares about this happening even long after making my post so just last weekend I decided to use the advice I got from everyone on here and move forward with what I needed to do.

So anyways, as you can see in the original post, I have been deeply depressed for a long time and I've missed my sister very much. I guess everything peaked last Friday because I was watching a TV show that had a Christmas episode in it and they showed a scene of a family having such a good time with each other on Christmas day. the thought of being all alone for another Christmas this year made me extremely sad, and before I knew it, I started to cry very hard without any control and that says a lot considering I am a 20 year old man.

I don't know what came into my mind at that point but I guess I started to recall some of the advice I got from this subreddit, and while I was literally in the middle of crying, I decided to rip the bandage off and just go for it. I grabbed my phone and sent my sister a huge text spilling out all my emotions, and I basically told her that I was wrong to not see that she was trying to protect me and I begged her for forgiveness. I decided not to hide anything so I even told her how depressed I've been, how lonely I've felt, and how devastated the thought of being all alone again for Christmas is making me. I put this all into one extremely long text (might have been the size of an essay lol) and I sent it to her on Friday night. I must say that I was very hopeless. I know for a fact that my sister is and has always been an absolute angel and she is a very kind and forgiving person, but considering how successful she is now and how horribly I treated her by not going to her wedding and just tormenting her so much, I actually thought she was going to tell me to fuck off, so I braced for the worst.

You won't believe this though, I woke up the next day and my phone started ringing first thing in the morning, and when I checked the number it was actually my sister!! I very nervously answered the call but I was also suddenly very happy. I never answered any of her calls when she wanted me to come to her wedding in the summer of last year, so the fact that she was calling me after I asked for a helping hand definitely meant that she was willing to make amends. Anyways, I answered the phone and she spoke to me so politely and in such a caring way, just like she used to do before and that immediately made me tear up. She told me that my message was beautiful and she even mentioned that she wasn't even that mad at me. Get this, she said that she has missed me a lot too, but she just unwantedly boycotted me because I was being so terrible with her for years leading up to her wedding. I started sobbing uncontrollably while talking to her (it was literally our first communication in a year and a half and our first positive one in 3 years) and I told her everything that was on my mind while begging for forgiveness. She assured me very quickly that she didn't have any hard feelings and then she invited me to come over to her and her husband's place so we could talk in person.

I went and paid her as well as her husband a visit on Sunday and I don't think I've ever been so happy in the last 3 years. When I saw my sister she gave me the biggest hug ever and it felt amazing! Just like the good old days! I even properly met her husband for the first time and he was very nice as well (I had seen him before when him and my sister were dating but that was after our relationship started to become stained so I always ignored him pretty much). Her husband apparently knew a lot about me and when I asked him how he knew so much, he mentioned that my sister always speaks very highly of me and has told him all about me as well.

She apparently even repeatedly made it clear to him that I am a very good brother but anger had just clouded my judgement which is why I didn't attend her wedding. I have to say, hearing this made me feel so guilty, I gave my sister such hell and all because of my own stupidity, but despite all of that, she always spoke so positively of me even behind my back.

So for the whole afternoon pretty much, me and my sister talked with each other like best friends, just like the good old times, and I got the chance to apologize to her face-to-face. She was so nice and literally the kindest person ever, just as she's always been, and she talked to me in such a polite manner. She explained to me that everybody makes mistakes but its how we act after making those mistakes that truly make us who we are, and because I apologized, she said that I had made it clear that I am indeed willing to learn from my mistakes and be a better person. She forgave me and we embraced each other before we spent the rest of the day catching up and telling each other about what we've been up to the last couple years. Her husband is also very fun to be around and all of us spent the evening watching a movie together while me and my sister's husband got to know each other. They even let me stay for the night and they told me that I was free to come over and stay with them anytime I like. Before coming back home yesterday, I talked with my sister again about how horrible life has been without her and she assured me that we will never be apart from each other again. She even joked that if I ended up spending Christmas all alone again this year, she would have to punch me again for being so distant lol!!

We firmly hugged each other again, both of us telling the other that we love them, and then I returned home on Monday. Thank you all so much for the advice you gave me on this subreddit! You helped me get my sister back and find happiness again in life!! I am a much better person now than I was before, and with my sister by my side again, I honestly feel like I have found the light again!

2022-11-04 14:32:58,depression,"I would write a long paragraph of how I started feeling this way but I cant remember, my memory has never been the greatest since highschool. I can't really remember the last time I've been actually happy either, I've kind of just been kind of normal and have just lived day to day. I don't follow any passions cause I don't know If I have any, I just picked a trade out of high school then went to college for it. I have terrible sleep, no matter how much I sleep I still seem to wake up tired unless I take melatonin. I don't like to be around people unless its someone I know fairly well, I tend to rely too much on relationships and then once they end (like the one that ended for me 2 months ago) they leave me feeling like an empty shell, I don't want to work anymore, sleep, eat (normally I could go an entire day with just breakfast and not feel hungry) or anything. 

Then I immediately try to go out and find my next relationship without any time in between. I often imagine myself dead but the only thing stopping me really is my family and friends and how I couldn't let them down, I know there's stages to suicide, I've never made a plan or anything I kind of just had thoughts about it. 

Thing is that I don't want to be depressed because I don't want people to know cause if I start taking action against it now people will just think that I'm overreacting because I'm going through a breakup when in reality the relationship just put a pause on it and then after it ended it boosted it back into a downward spiral. I feel like I'm weak if I have to go to others or take medications to fix my mental problems. I want to be able to fix them myself but I don't know how, I have been going to the gym and walks by myself but all it serves is a distraction, anytime I'm alone with myself I'm thrown right back into sad thoughts. I just want to smile genuinely again. 

Has anyone been in my spot and fixed it without help or is there ways to go about this?",I don't know if I'm depressed and I don't want to fix it with outside help
2022-11-04 14:27:21,depression,"So a very long term relationship failed about a year ago. I feel like I’m slowly falling apart. I have adhd and bi-polar amongst whatever else haven’t been diagnosed. I’ve become a heavy drinker and here and there I feel like I have moments of clarity. I’m falling apart, especially when I think of what I used to be. Idk. I know I’ve not given any context. I don’t want to be the type to reach out “for sympathy”. I’ve been drinking, just doing a reach out. If anyone sees this and is thinking of going to that grocery, /liquor store. Don’t.",I guess I’m reaching out
2022-11-04 14:25:30,depression,"Went from sky-high to crashing into the ground within 48 hours. My problems are small relative to many, though this pain is still real. 
A few weeks ago, I made a commitment that had teeth. I was going to live an active/healthy lifestyle which would be the final piece of the puzzle to achieve happiness. This is hardly disputed. We need exercise to be at our best. I had made some major financial accomplishments and felt great as of a few weeks ago. Started exercising and eating healthy and could already feel the “addiction” to a healthy lifestyle coming. I loved it. This is exactly what I needed. 
Then, the past couple of days happened. I performed a workout and realized that I couldn’t read afterwards, for hours. I felt somewhat dizzy/lightheaded. “Okay”, I told myself… “I obviously took that workout too hard and need to avoid that intensity”. I took the next day off and then tried to perform a much lower intensity level workout but the same thing happened. Went to the ER and had more than a few tests completed on me and all results came back normal except one. Even though my resting blood pressure is normal, it spiked through the roof after exercise. This is exercise-induced hypertension. Not good. Not good in the immediate time but also a bad sign for the future. Nurse said that I just pushed too hard and after taking it slower for a while my body will get used to the workouts and it won’t happen anymore. All my research says otherwise and that this is a serious issue. Obviously, this is extremely saddening and a roller coaster of going from amazing to feeling like I’m in a gutter within 2 days. I’m only 26 years old and essentially being under the impression that I can’t workout which means that my goals of weight-loss/living an active and healthy lifestyle will be difficult at best. Everything else in life was going great and I thought that I found exactly what I finally wanted/needed, then it falls apart. Just upset right now. Thanks for the read. By the way, I’m a male 5ft 9in weighing 285 a few weeks ago and weighing 260 right now, for what it’s worth.","Well, that’s unfortunate."

I was left alone during break and lunch hours at school for about 3 months just alone with my thoughts contemplating about life. My birthday passed not even a single soul except my parents wished me a birthday. I have no one to talk to or share my feelings to, I'm all alone. I've tried everything but nothing seems to work.

(This question was pulled from a YouTube video by Thoraya ‘What scares you most about yourself?’)

I wanted to share my response here with like-minded ppl who understand.
Pls share yours if you feel comfortable to, I know a lot of us feel quite alone &amp; are needing to talk with someone…

***TW: self harm/suicide talk***

I’m scared that one day my impulses will get the best of me &amp; in a rash moment I’ll actually do something irreversible &amp; detrimental, taking my life in the span of one minute of having the thought of kms. When most likely what I needed &amp; need in these moments—was and is love, reassurance &amp; safety.

This true scenario, that I fight against during my darkest moments, is what scares me the absolute most about myself. I never know what will happen to me—or what actions I’ll take in result of new traumatic events and or quick self catastrophizing moments in time.

It had been a month since I last sh yesterday, while my face and head are now sore from all the punching, as I feel this pain, it’s a hard reminder of what I wish I hadn’t done. What I wish I had the Will power to do. And what I’m fighting each and every day to not do. I wish my brain would autopilot to loving myself during hard times but it actually does the opposite, it wishes to end me.",What scares you most about yourself?

2022-11-04 13:56:24,depression,"i’m 19 and so lonely and tired. it’s ok i don’t have friends i guess, i’m busy with school and my job anyway. i see everyone else with their friends and boyfriends and i used to be filled with raging jealousy but now i’ve just accepted i’ll never have that

i just want someone to love me. someone i love who wants me in their life. even friends. i have a best friend who i’ve been so close with since i was like 10 but mid high school she got a boyfriend and other friends and i didn’t see much of her anymore. i still see her and talk to her often, but i long to feel that little smile and “god i love my friends” feeling in my heart

a year ago i met a guy. we were so close and i thought he was the one. he set aside hours to talk to me every single day and i did the same. he led me on. i went with it cause i had never been in a relationship before and didn’t know how this shit was supposed to work. he said he only wanted to keep me around and never loved me and lied. wanted the lonely quiet girl to feel like somebody loved her and use her to play to his own advantage. i’m disgusted, everything i thought about him was a lie. i’m quite plain looking as well, not ugly, but nothing special. i will never find someone who i love who also loves me

i don’t know what’s wrong for me but human interaction just sounds exhausting at this point. i spend all my time in my room studying, relaxing, or daydreaming about a feeling that i haven’t felt in a long time. all my love has been stomped out and i feel like an empty void and so numb. i guess it’s better than always pain like i used to be but i just want to be happy and love people again. family, friends, and i want someone special but everyone good is taken or has no interest in a girl like me. i want to just be able to love and believe it’s actually real, but it’s not. at least for me",i wish i could feel love like i used to. human connection is all but a distant memory

I cant pose for pictures bc im really fucking wierd. ive been struggling with a lot of mental health issues as if lately and school is beating the shit out of me. one time this girl i was talkting to said ""i think your cute"" and i never believed her, every time someone says that i dont believe them bc ive been the victim of many games of oreo and cant help but think some one is calling me cute as a joke, everytime i look at myself i think how no one could ever possibly like me. my parents say ""you should be greatful you have a healthy body"" yeah sure but its there in the most ugly way possible. my mom and family say how much of a ""good looking man"" i am but come on guys, your forced to do that. there is no one for me and im tired of pretending its alright, its really not. i just really need someone. i mean, im bisexual, how the fuck do i not have a bf/gf?? im literally playing both fucking teams and still loosing. like am i that ugly? sometimes my brother takes the time out of his day  to remind me how ugly i am and how retarded and stupid i am. if im not in my own house by age 19 ill probably hang my self. oh well we ball anyway",i have no purpose and no one is here for me
2022-11-04 13:50:28,depression,"In college now and I'm watching everything I worked for go to waste. I'm failing my classes, isolating myself, and ive started to gain a lot of weight. I worked so hard in high school to get into a good college and get into the engineering program. If I fail the 2 classes I'm taking now (I have a &lt;50% in both) I'll get kicked out of my program. The thing is I don't even have the energy to care. And on top of that one of the classes im taking now im retaking because i failed it last year. Its the same fucking content but im failing because im a stupid lazy piece of shit. In fact I'm doing worse in the class this year than I did last year. And I know i need to get tutoring but I was doing that already im just that fucking stupid.

My past self set up everything for me to have a good life. I just needed to get through 4 more years of school. But I can't even do that. I wake up everyday just wanting to die and give up. I hate myself for not having the energy to care. And for fucking everything up all the fucking time. There's also no point in changing my major because I don't fucking like anything. I have no passions or interests. And if I drop out I'll have wasted all this fucking money and time and I'll STILL be depressed. There is nothing I can do that will make me happy in life. There is no escaping depression. I'll just end up rotting my life away and be a disappointment to everyone I know.

Maybe 10 years ago, I thought I was through the worst of it after I had a crisis and nearly ended my life. I had a moment of clarity when I knew I wasn't going to do it, and I figured, since I was going to stick around, I might as well try to make the most of it, and I've held onto that. It's served me well, and I still feel the same way. Lately, however, a lot has been happening. I recently divorced my wife of 7 yrs, had a re-realization of my bisexuality, started dating a guy, fell in and then out of love, started a business, which is not going all that well.. I'm living alone.. and lately none of the topics I hear around me at work or with acquaintances even remotely interest me. I feel completely apathetic to EVERYTHING. These are all things I've experienced before off and on, but the new thing is just saying, ""I'm gonna kill myself"" out of nowhere. It's weird because I'm not thinking about it when I say it. I'll be walking to my car after work and just out of nowhere say ""maybe tonight's the night."" Sometimes it feels like a relief to say it out loud. Sometimes it even strikes me as funny. It always spooks me on some level, though, because it almost feels like I'm not the one saying it. I'm still resolved to not kms for the same reasons that I didn't do it 10 years ago. It's still a little concerning, however. If you're still here, maybe tell me if you've had this happen to you before. Thanks. Much love.","Randomly saying ""I'm definitely gonna kms"" when alone?"

2022-11-04 12:46:03,depression,"Everyone knows this but the Gen Z/zoomer era is just fucked. Even Gen Zs themselves know that, myself included. We are the first generation to be born into this internet era, where things like social media, gaming consoles, smartphones, etc. were basically just handed to us without much regulation whatsoever. I know that me and countless other kids had the opportunity to roam wherever the hell we wanted on the internet without supervision which led us to dark corners of the internet, and inevitably messed up our brain.

But aside from all that stuff you've previously heard about, it's just sad the direction in which humanity is heading. Humans were never meant to live like this. We used to be more socially connected, more active, healthier and happier in all forms because we lived a more natural, primitive life. None of that exists anymore for basically all of us reading this. 

It's even scarier that Gen Z is eventually going to inherit this earth once the older generations are gone.

2022-11-04 12:18:40,depression,"I’m 21/f. My whole life I’ve always known I was “different.” When I was a small child I was ruthlessly bullied and I never understood why I acted and felt so different to my peers until I was older. Im now an adult and have been diagnosed with ADHD/Autism and I just… struggle to see a reason to live. Every day I’m exhausted and trying to keep afloat with adult responsibilities just feel like trying to save a sinking ship with a Dixie cup. I feel so stupid when I miss the smaller details or social cues and I’m constantly alone. 

Always. Alone.

I’m so tired. I’m barely eating or I’m binging until I’m sick. My hair is thinning, and I look and feel ill. Family has begun hiding weapons around the house and they keep gently stepping around the elephant in the room that is me. I wish I knew how to fix myself but I just don’t see a way out that will work. I’ve tried to claw my way out so many times, what will make it different now? 

How does everyone around me see me decaying and they do nothing? They say they love me, do they not see the dark circles under my eyes? My tense body posture from all the trauma I’m holding, the constant exhaustion and irritability. What will it take for someone to see me? See *me.* Not the fake shell, the real person hurting underneath. I am so alone in this world and I’m just struggling to keep pushing forward.

I wonder often how long it would take others to get over me if I did decide to leave. It always seems as if everyone in my life silently resents me, and while my death may cause initial pain it would take a huge burden off my family both financially and emotionally and it burns so deeply in my chest knowing it. That little kid that still loves somewhere deep down is crushed every time I get a glare or an eye roll from a loved one or a disappointed sigh from my boss/coworkers. I hate being a burden.

I am scared of death but I don’t know how much longer I can keep on living. At this point I’m basically just surviving on fumes. I miss when I didn’t hate myself and want to die more than not.",I thought I was going to have a fighting chance but I didn’t know I had a losing hand from the start.

I know I’m different from the other people, but is thay really an excuse to get away from a person? Why can’t people just respect eachother. I’ve been stuck in my room for a long time, and it’s starting to feel like a prison, and depression is the crime I commited. I don’t see any point in living if everybody thinks im weird to talk to, because whenever i talk to anybody from my class, they just backoff or act like im not there I dont know what i did wrong.

I work a minimum wage job as a barista and that is *all* I do. On my off days I lay in bed all day and try to sleep.

2022-11-04 11:59:05,depression,"It's never a good sign when I start sharing my life on Reddit again. Please bear with me. If I'm telling this online it's because I don't have anyone to tell it.

18M, for 3 years of Highschool I had depressive symptoms due to social anxiety, circle of self-isolation (isolating because scared of people, causing to be more scared of people, so isolation more, etc...), and possible autism. I was completely alone, had no hopes whatsoever and went dangerously close to suicide. If I hadn't found myself a passion in music composition I would be dead by now.

 Towards the end of HS, I met this girl that became my friend. We had so much in common we were basically clones. She integrated me to her friend group. I was starting to see light again. Being my first real contact in years, I quickly fell in love. After graduating, I confessed to her, and to my huge surprise she said she also felt something for me, so we started dating. They also came out as non-binary, which I didn't mind a second, I was completely in love with the person, doesn't matter if it's a she or they.

That was at the beginning of June, and boy this month was the happiest I had been in my entire life. After years of darkness, I had find someone to trust and to live my life with, a passion in music, I was finally out of HS and on my way to properly study music at uni, starting to get confident in myself. I thought life could actually get better, what could possibly go wrong? 

A month later, they came out as aromantic, and broke up with me. As we both hate conflict, it was done in a calm and peaceful discussion while drinking tea, with their cat on my lap, it was difficult for me to understand what was actually happening. We talked it through and decided to stay friends. They felt horribly guilty for putting me through this situation, and did say the classic ""it's not you, it's me"", which for once wasn't false I guess? We both always had been very kind and understanding to each other, which made this break up even more painful for both of us. There wasn't anyone that had done something wrong, that had cheated or been violent, not any dispute, they just didn't feel in love with me, period. They didn't judge their feelings right, and this experience helped them figuring it out. 

We still hang out from times to times when we're both available and chat online (we're both not very chatty online). We agreed to not lose sight of each other. And to be honest, when I'm physically with them I don't really feel love anymore, it just feels straight up wrong now, like they were my siblings or something. It's the moment they're not here that I do, especially tonight while I'm writing this at 4am. They're still my only friend.

But welp, I'm back to being miserable again. The happiness of this short period is fading away and is leaving me to the darkness of isolation again. My social anxiety has worsen. Haven't made a single friend at uni despite being surrounded by people with the same passion as me. All I have left is music, but I'm becoming unsure of my abilities as a composer, I can't think straight, I'm scared of my future. 

Tonight I received a message from them telling me they're going to a Halloween party and showing me off their cosplay, and I don't know why but it felt like a stroke in my heart. They're out here going on partying with their new group of friends, and I was sitting alone in front of my computer, looking at a blank page of sheet music, just like countless other nights. Is it jealousy that I feel? Am I frustrated because I'm not out there with them? What I know is that it put a trigger in me, and not the good kind of trigger. I had my month of happiness, it's safe to say that this was the peak of my life. It's cliche to say, but it is true, I'll never find someone like that again. I wish I could say life doesn't revolve around love and that happiness comes in many form, but I've been alone too much to agree with this. Love was my main source of inspiration, my reason to get up in the morning, my motivation to get through the day it basically saved me. And now it's over, and it will never come again. 

The other thing that was keeping me alive, music, is also failing me. I just can't compose like before. Can't count how many times I have tried to transcribe my pain through it like I used to do. Music had such a powerful cathartic power on me, but I can't seem to make it work anymore.

I'm laying in my bed, alone, no love, no music, I don't see the point of staying alive any longer.",In darkness again

I doubt I'll make many friends in the new place I live, but I will try. It's a tiny community and most people are older. I doubt there are any single people my age (37).

A childhood friends dad killed himself the other day and I have reached out to people to talk to them about it. But no one has reached out to me. It's a bit rough, but I'm getting by.

I've been in therapy for the past 3 years off and on to try work out what's wrong with me and what lead to my current situation. There's no solutions forth coming. 

I don't want to self harm in anyway, but I do think about death a bit. Mainly the fact no one will come to my funeral and if I don't die at work it will be a while before they find my body. Likely six days before someone at work comes looking for me for not turning, but no one knows my address so maybe longer.

Anywho. Lonely people of the world wide web. You aren't alone. 

Take care of yourself and love yourself as much as you can. I'm sure you're good people just like I hope I am. We just slipped through the cracks. 

Lots of love",I've isolated myself it's what I want but I don't know where to go from here?
2022-11-03 16:45:12,depression,"I feel so exhausted despite not doing that much and I don't know if it's because of my depression or I haven't slept that well in the past few days. Even typing this feels exhausting. 

Next few things will be TMI so just scroll or ignore it

My depression worsened to the point where I can't remember the last time I brushed my teeth, taking a shower feels like a chore and it's getting harder to clean my room unless I feel okay or have random bursts of energy. Even getting up can feel like a chore when it shouldn't. My room has gotten more messy which is embarrassing and although I do my best to clean or even start cleaning it, I always go back to square one.

I've told my dad about my depression and he knows about it but doesn't take it that serious. I've told him about me not always having the energy to clean up my room through text but he told me that I have the energy to spend time with friends and I tried explaining it to him but I got ignored and never got a response. 

Yesterday he got mad again telling me I don't listen,how I'm given an inch then I take a yard, he blames himself and the environment I'm in for the way I am and other stuff. My depression is the reason why but I couldn't use that as an excuse so I had to stay quiet while listening to him talk because he wouldn't accept it. At the end if the conversation he told me by the end of the semester, he'd be talking to me about something and doing something to my room whether I like it or not. Despite him telling me that, I already had a plan for my room but I don't wanna tell him. 

I can't tell his wife either (she's not my bio mom) because I'm an adult and what I'm going through is all in my head and or just a phase. I don't really have anyone else to go to in my house.

Even though he knows about depression and said he'd be there for me, it feels contradicting as well as a slap in the face. I don't really feel comfortable talking to him about my problems anymore cause of it. I already had several bad depressive episodes because of him. I kind of feel trapped but college and hanging out with friends help but not as much.",My depression got worse and it will never be taken seriously by my dad

2022-11-03 16:43:58,depression,"Hi guys. I apologize if I’m in the wrong community but I was hoping to explain how I’ve been feeling for the longest time and see if anyone can relate to tell me what might be going on. 

How I’ve been feeling: I don’t go to my college classes anymore and I’ve fallen weeks behind on work. I have trouble falling asleep (I stay up till 6AM). I wake up with no motivation in the morning, I don’t ever feel like leaving the bed to even brush my teeth. I have started having 1 snack a day as my only meal (no motivation to eat). I’ve began watching TV shows and movies all the time (4+ hrs a day) to sorta escape reality. I don’t have any energy to even talk to my family and friends. I don’t smile much anymore (as my parents noted out). I have lost all interest in the hobbies that made me so happy. I know for sure that I have social anxiety, but what I’m feeling now feels more than that. 

Can anyone relate to these feeling? Possibly know what could explain it?

Idk honestly, I've been so lonely for a long time it's normal, though it does hurt a lot sometimes...

I wish I could stop feeling so pathetic and desperate, I somehow just feel so stupid and weak wanting to be hugged and close to someone, daydreaming of an unrealistic relationship of someone actually wanting to be around me...

Maybe it's for the best this will never happen, I'm not worth anyone's love or time, and I really don't know if I could trust anyone to not eventually ghost me or betray me...

2022-11-03 15:53:08,depression,"They says you become who you are through experiences so maybe that’s why I’m such a piece of shit. I’ll keep this as summed up as possible. (Edit: maybe not)

I’ve grown up around a ton of negativity my whole life. Lived in a pretty toxic household. My parents constantly fought and argued up until I was 10 when they got divorced. Mom moved out and dad found a new gf about a year later. All was good that year, I was happy and loved moms new house. About 2 years into my dads relationship his gf and her kids moved in with us. That’s when I saw my dads gf’s true colours. The arguing began just like it did with mom. But arguments lasted longer which created constant tension in the house even when they weren’t arguing. There were good periods with little conflict but they didn’t last very long. In the past I’d say my dad was the catalyst in most arguments with my mom. But this time it was his gf. Not gonna get into details because I could go all day but I had no respect for her. She treated me unfairly to the rest of the kids so I wouldn’t listen to her. That would cause conflict and make me want to go running to moms even more because I felt she didn’t like me, on top of the arguing it was too much for my 12 year old self to handle. 
Moms house became my safe place and I felt like all the stress and worries faded once I stepped through that door. Mom constantly reminded me I could talk to her about anything, which I did often. We could talk about anything together for hours and hours. She knew me so well and had a way with words. Every time i would talk to her about stuff that was bothering me she was so reassuring. She helped me through so much and is the reason I was such a happy, outgoing, energetic kid. But when I was 13 it changed. I found out my mom was undiagnosed bipolar and had took her life. I’ll keep this part short but the next year wasn’t easy. My mental health was terrible but I played it off like I was managing what I was going through alright. For some reason I felt like I always had to play it off like I was ok when I wasn’t after mom died. I had nobody to go to and bottled all my emotions up. When family asked how I was I just said “good”, nothing else, I stayed silent and became very reserved, barely spoke at dinner or about my day where as before you couldn’t shut me up. At least at my moms. Losing my mom changed my personality. I started looking life differently. In a negative way. I couldn’t make sense of anything and why this happened to me. It took me a long time to feel moments of happiness again but I still wore the mask everyday because I couldn’t let anyone know I wasn’t happy.

Fast forward years im 19 now and at this point I’ve managed to accept my moms death to the best of my ability. But I don’t like who Ive turned into and I’m not sure if this trauma has caused me to be this way, or if it’s all on me or maybe a bit of both. During high school I made poor decisions academically and didn’t care for my grades, not handing in work or assignments and despite feeling like a failure 24/7 I could never find the energy to try. And when I did to my best ability, I saw little difference in the outcome.  It wasn’t until after graduating I realized I was really “my own worst enemy” as my dad would tell me time and time and time again. My depression tends to make me think of the past a lot and maybe my depressive state makes me think that my actions were worse than they actually were. But I still feel guilt because I want my dad to have a reason to be proud of me and I let him down a lot in the past. My depression has gotten bad over the past year and I’ve beat myself up mentally to the point my confidence and self esteem is almost not existent. I know im fucked up my mentality and I don’t think like the average person. I shut down mentally a lot easier and give up on myself before even trying. I can’t pinpoint exactly when my mental struggles became so bad they affect everything I do everyday. I feel like a let down, a piece of shit. I’m about to flunk out of Uni because I can barely bring myself to do the work anymore. I’m so done with my mind and my life that at 19 years of age I’ve almost 100% given up on my future. I’m going to give myself some time to seek therapy and see if that changes or helps the way I’m feeling but I’m pretty hopeless. At this point I do not expect to live to see 21. Anyways, that’s all.

2022-11-03 15:01:53,depression,"This is story about me (on a throw away for obvious reasons). When I was in eighth grade my mother slapped me. I remember having my back to the fridge and her screaming in my face about school. I wasn't a perfect student. I was dealing with all of the terrible things in middle school and little did I know at the time depression, an anxiety disorder, ADHD, and high functioning autism. All of these factors wove together to become the scariest part of my life. 

She was yelling at me for not handing in some work, yelling over and over again ""Why can't you just do your work?"". I replied with the truest statement of my life ""I don't know."" Then she slapped me. I remember it so vividly, even now, nearly 6 years later. I felt the sting, and I just stared at the ground for what felt like minutes. There were still tears on my face when I looked back at her, but I wasn't crying anymore. I was pissed. All of the self-hatred and sadness immediately became anger. I kept quiet and just starred back at her until she gave up, but I was itching for a fight. That day made me realize the power I had. I wanted to hit her back, to make her cry the way she made me cry. I wanted to make my fists bleed after hitting her so many times. I wanted to hurt her. The anger blinded me and turned me into something I was not. I remember my fists shaking as I tried to hold them still. The thought of turning all the emotional pain she caused me into physical pain that she could feel made happy. It was terrifying. The amount of joy that came from these terrible thoughts. They stuck around for years, and even now I can catch myself slipping back into that maniacal state of self-preservation. The scariest thing about a person is what their mind is willing to do to keep itself safe. For the last years of my schooling I pinned all of the bad feelings to one person, and if she were to go away then so would the feelings. I wanted her dead, and I wanted to do it.

Note: I don't want this to be a post saying it is okay to hurt people, this is me trying to share an experience that unfortunately other people have gone through too. If you have these feelings, please try and find help. No one should be in a place where they feeling like the only way to escape is violence. I am lucky enough to have survived my suicide attempts, and made it to a better place in life. These memories never go away, but now they are a lesson instead of an example.",How depression can turn to anger

I was sick from my intestines (btw its called irritable bowl syndrome or something along the lines of that), It didn't help the fact I was sick from that so after again the fight from my big brother I was at my home everything went great but then February hit, (ANOTHER PERSON DIED FROM MY FAMILY :() so far 2 people who died were the only ones that showed that they actually cared about me, (fuck life) so we had to flight to another country and keep in mind it was still zoom so I did classes as normal BUT IT WASN'T I got told by my parents only 2 week but those weeks turned into 6 months AND I SUFFERED A LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOT ZOOM CLASSES + CHURCH SCHOOL (good thing am no longer in church school YEAH), and also besides the IBS syndrome guess what :D? I got sick with  **lining of the stomach** (gastritis), and it wasn't temporarly I STILL SUFFER THOSE LMFAOO, (I hate my life), anyways we got back around fall and I started playing this game called genshin impact a shitton since I didn't speak to my other friends and the guy with the ps4 and I got into a argument I didn't talk to anyone so I played a shitton genshin impact and I enjoyed it It distracted my mind I felt like I had something to do just like in 2017-2018, I also have to say we went back to class in person and I loved my teachers during that year, but the sickness from the stomach and intestine wasn't the best.... I kept great grades only 2 B's and all A's great right? well then 2022 hits I finished the story up of genshin up to ver 2.6? I believe then I decided to start speaking to my friends again, lets say the group is now separated, the guy with the ps4 literally made me buy vanguard and doesn't play with me and if he does his wifi goes out and goes offline for the rest of the day I haven't spooked to him, the other guys lets say they rarely get back online we don't play like we used to, and recently one of them recovered his old yt channel from 2018 and shared a video with the whole group and seeing it reminded me how lonely am I am once again, everyday I lose my time playing genshin impact, and if I change game to another one I still feel like trash, I got a lot of games that I could play but I don't because they don't really feel fun anymore, NOTE: the guy with the ps4 is not part of the group we have (because they don't know him, well they do but we only are with ourselves because neither him or us want to talk not cuz they fighted or have a problem but is just liked that), every day I just get up and its the same shit, I miss 2020 ESPECIALLY THAT I MISEED 6 MONTHS OF GENSHIN HOLY SHITTTT but thats not the point, the point is that every person I talk online its literally just few words and silence even with my og online friends, on school I have also friends but its only during school because they are busy with life idk, at this point I no longer have reason to live... everytime I just remember what I used to do, remember how we played the moments we had, Idk why I go to school I rather dropout at this point I have 0 motivation...",This darkness

2022-11-03 14:05:04,depression,"First time posting so idk if this is the right place, and this is probably going to be a long post. I just feel pretty lost at the moment. I literally have no one to talk to this about as my family and friends all live about 2000 miles from me and I don't want them to freak out. I can't really talk to the people I work with either because I'm in the type of job where having suicidal thought would probably get me fired. 

I've never been diagnosed with depression or anything like that, but I've been having suicidal thoughts for years now. I'm not sure when it started or really even why I've never been bullied or treated wrong I just don't want to be alive. I went a couple years without talking to anyone other than my parents because I was so anxious all the time around other people. It got so bad I even became a shut-in for half a year. 

That kind of led me to where I am now. I didn't want to be a burden to my parents, so I decided to get this job. I also kind of thought that this new situation would force me out of my shell, and I might stop feeling so down all the time. It didn't help at all, literally nothing changed. It's just made me realize how out of place I really am in the world. This last month I've like only had suicidal thoughts.

I've always dealt with these thoughts by just ignoring them until they go away, telling myself that everything will be better in the future. I've managed to go this long with no one really noticing. Other than my parents getting pissed when my grades started to drop.  This time it's really different though. It's like I've used the future as my crutch, and now that I've gotten to the point where it was supposed to get better, and it didn't.

So now I really feel like I have nothing in the future. Why should I put up with the bullshit anymore? I know I'm never going to deal with these thoughts and these emotions I feel. So am I just supposed to carry along, it's already hard for me to just wake up in the morning. 

I can't tell anyone because if I lose this job, I'm basically garbage to society. Not only that my parents probably won't look at me the same way, no one will. I'll also feel like shit because I haven't been here that long. The other answer is to keep going, but I don't think I've got much more in me. To me it's looking like both have the same outcome anyways. 

Lowkey, I know it's not supposed to sound rational, but to me suicide feels like the answer.",I just need an answer

I dont have much experience writing or venting on reddit so I apologize in advance. Im going to split the post up in sections to hopefully make it easier to follow

&amp;#x200B;

A bit of backstory:

In October 28th, 2019, I was a passenger in a car crash that led to one of my good friends passing, and ever since I have felt like my life is a worthless attempt and that it should've been given to him. Prior to the crash, the driver, the friend that passed, and I were, in my opinion, one of the best friend trios around and I was a fairly average high school student who was typically the class clown. As a result of the crash, one of my consistent nightmares since then was going to school for the following months after the crash and being treated like a ghost because everyone was afraid I was going to have a mental breakdown at the first sight of them, including my best friend who wouldn't hang out with me for weeks.  I remember the driver of the crash and I agreed to maintain our friendship for life in the name of our late friend. He recently visited my college for a homecoming event to visit me, as well as one of my roommates who is also their friend from high school. I had the same, goofy and dumb attitude and I felt the old best friendship had died. Ever since the crash, I feel like I haven't been able to have a genuine laugh. 

My parents and I run a local family nail salon in a relatively average town. With my parents being first-generation immigrants and me being the only child, it was only natural for me to be the golden boy that had to be a poster child they could talk and brag about to customers, family, etc. My parents raised me with the typical Asian work ethic of honor, responsibility, and the motto ""if you're struggling, work harder"".

I'm currently in my second year of college as a computer science major and have classes that are notoriously hard at my school. I'm currently failing two classes mid-semester and don't have the nerve to tell my parents as I know they will be disappointed and order me to simply ""do better"". I also don't have my friends as they are all at different universities. I constantly see them having the time of their lives on social media. For the sake of transparency, I do have one very good friend who I am particularly close to, but I developed a habit of not telling my friends how I truly feel following the accident. In addition, my parents have decided to take a break from each other and as a result, they call me separately to vent about each other.

I feel like I have no one to talk to. My routine from day to day goes as follows: I go to school, go to the gym, go home and do homework, and sleep. I see so many other people including my former friends having the time of their lives in college. I'm not a particularly introverted person and while I don't feel as if i ""deserve"" friends, I feel like it's normal to have at least a few to have fun with regularly. I feel like I have no options other than getting my degree due to ongoing pressure from my parents. I can't drop out, I can't change majors. I used to wake up optimistic in the hopes that something would change. I've tried the typical clubs, bars, etc., and even prayer to no avail. I feel like it's my destiny to be a loser whos a stepping stone and a lesson to others around me.

Last weekend I tried to end my life by driving 160mph into a  guardrail but stopped myself because of the thought of what it would do to my parents. This weekend I walked outside at night in the hopes of someone hitting and killing me. I don't know what to do but I can feel every ounce of hope has left my body. I wish I was the fit, smart and ambitious person I was but I just don't think I can reach that again. I don't typically cry but I found myself constantly crying for the past two weeks. I don't have options, I can't keep this routine of pretending everything is fine to the people around me in hopes of things eventually getting better. My life has been downhill since the crash and I'm at my breaking point. I've tolerated so much and I don't want to continue living.

2022-11-03 13:10:10,depression,"Sorry, this may be a bit ranty, but also...just trying to keep it together. Apologies if this post belongs elsewhere I only recently started doing the reddit thing.  


A shortish summary, have had a lot of change this year alone on top of a crap load of over just ""life stuff"".  What's eating at me is just the constant feeling of being alone even though physically I'm not and it's been a challenge for me, at least so far, for two decades. So, I just quietly once our day winds down spend my nights processing the day trying to keep my shit tight so I don't let those who do rely on me down. It's easier some days and other day's its soul crushing. I essentially even though I have a few people, I don't have a few people at the same time (fair weather friend / family)  


* My social circle per natural causes / some man made - has shrunk steadily and it's never been very large. 
* I do have my wife, but one of the challenges here is if I'm struggling with some things - and even try to talk about it - i feel like I get the quiet eyeroll, ""man up"" vibe, or is it that really a big deal. Granted some concessions here - we have had our first kid so - we do have a pretty full plate (much more not listed on that plate, but that is the latest. 
* The town we live in - is my wifes home time she grew up here and we'll pretty much die here which is fine. My home is where i lay my head down, but I just have no ""people"" of my own despite trying for the last 6 years (lockdowns didn't help). One friend for awhile was the fiance of my wifes friend - and well he bounced out as soon that relationship went south.
* Have been attending a small group within a local church that isn't bad, but to not strain this point too much - people are friendly, but the experience thus far (only on those designated days can you feel ""supported""). I often get a lot of well-mannered banter about being ""an ogre"" per se because I am a semi home body but it's not really because I want to be. I used to hang out as often as schedules would allow in my previous town, but despite open invitations to go out for coffee, meals, movies, just about anything (me initiating) have had very little success where people want to meet (can count on one hand where I've met folks from said group outside the once a week setting).  


Essentially, I try to be fairly easy going, just like anyone else I have my days where I'm not the life of the party, but especially now as a thirty something - I find trying to have even a decent friendship near impossible. Whilst, for example my wife - has all the people in the world for her - which is comforting, but also depressing when comparing.

To sum it up, I just feel giving up and just swallowing my own loneliness. I don't know what else to do to try and I acknowledge not every one is going to want to be your friend, like you. I don't want people to think that's what I'm seeking / wanting. Just want one good friend again.",Why is it so hard for people to be a friend?

I am just confused on if I have it or not, and I am too afraid to say anything to anyone around me. I didn't know which other places to go to after I read the rules because I looked through them and didn't find a place that I thought would know better than this subreddit. To start off: I have a good relationship with both parents, my parents are together, and I live for what I know is a normal life. From now on I am just going to talk about why am confused or what is going on in my life to see what you guys think. I often times think to myself that I am worthless or I just cause people trouble. I also just can't shake the feeling that I am huge burden to my family and friends. Whenever friends or family say anything nice to me I can't see what they are seeing and just think they are saying those things out of pity. I also think that my friends only talk to me because they feel bad for me. When I am alone for a little bit (it really doesn't take a long time to start thinking this) I feel like I am lonely and that once again everything done for me is just out of pity. I can't see to think well of my self at all it seems. Most of the time I listen to something or I am just doing things just to keep myself detracted from those thoughts that I mentioned above. I also sometimes feel just empty; I don't feel sad, mad, or any emotion for the matter. I am afraid that I just have nothing in me to feel anymore. I have gone to a couple of funerals in the past year or two and have felt nothing. I also find it a little bit hard to connect with how people feel sometimes.

I most of the time carry a pocket knife around with me because it is a helpful tool most of the time. Other times I cut into my arms just because I get curious if I can still feel anything.

2022-11-03 12:50:36,depression,"Continuing
So I found another psychologist. And this time, I found someone who’s not from my ethnicity because I want a more neutral and objective perspective. He guided me through some stuck points and how to think about those stuck points in a more productive way. It actually worked, and we had five sessions. The only problem was that, the sessions were priceyyyyyy😂 

And I’ve been taking lots of sick leaves since I took the medication, Zoloft. I felt like it kept me from crying a lot and I had a better appetite and gained some weights, but it also suppressed my emotions. I still have little to zero motivation to do anything productive. I might have anxiety as well because I get really anxious about going to work or just getting outside. And the medication didn’t help that. In fact, I was at least able to work regularly before taking Zoloft, but I’ve only worked for one and a half month since taking it. And my physician increased the dosage from 50 to 200mg, and we finally agreed that it didn’t work for me. So we were supposed to start gradually reducing the dosage in the next session. Then, the admin told me he no longer worked there. And before I could find a new physician, my job contract was terminated so I also lost OHIP. For those who might not know, a work permit holder in Ontario needs to have an employment letter stating that the employer is willing to hire the employee for at least 6 months, to be eligible for applying for OHIP. And the expiry date of my health card was on the exact same date of the last day of employment contract. I didn’t think it would be a problem because I thought would be eligible to apply for permanent residency after a year of work. And now, even if I’ve worked for more than 1500 hours, which is close to the total hour 1,560, I’m still not eligible because they only count 30 working hours a week. So to make it brief, I need to work for 3 months more. 

So now it’s like a vicious cycle. I want to work, but I have to find a job. And depression is keeping me from being productive. Even so, I forced myself to send resumes and do interviews. But I guess maybe sometimes job hunting really needs luck, especially when it’s close to winter. So right now, I’m trying to reduce the dosage to 100 mg cuz I only have 100mg pills. And paying private for clinics would burden me a lot. I wanna stop the medication, study English in the meantime, and hopefully find a new job. 

And dont worry, I still have some savings so at least I’m grateful that I won’t be starving.

Now, I don't like being depressed but there is nothing about a ""normal"" life that excites me. I don't want to travel and I don't want to go out and I don't want a job. I like studying and reading because it gives me access to an alternate reality where, at least for that time, I don't have to deal with any of that.

2022-11-03 12:31:31,depression,"Hi, I’ll be writing journals to sort of motivate myself. Let’s start by introducing myself. I’m a work permit holder from Hong Kong, came to Toronto last summer and had been working since then, until recently losing my job.

At first, the fresh air,  much larger parks and real welcoming people enlightened me a lot. It kept me from thinking about stuff back in Hong Kong a bit. And I started a few part-time jobs, and then got a full time opportunity in marketing. I did cry occasionally, but I thought at least I was able to control my emotions. But then, maybe it was the changes of the seasons, or the stress from work, I was drawn back to the original depressive ‘me’. I started to cry more, like suddenly bursting with tears on the bus or in the middle of the night. It got to a point that I realized my depression was getting real serious again. Back in Hong Kong, I had friends whom I’ve known for years supporting me, but I didn’t have the same strong bonding here. I did meet some genuine friends here and I love them. It’s just they haven’t gone through the same experience, so there would be limitations of understanding. 

Then, I started seeking help from the mental professionals like physicians and psychotherapist. I took prescribed medication and had regular therapy sessions. Fairly speaking, these approaches were not completely ineffective, but they did not actually help me. I did learn coping with my childhood trauma better, like stop blaming myself as my parents did. But the therapist wasn’t doing well in the PTSD aspect. One thing I found really sarcastic or offended was she saying thank you to me after I shared my anger and sorrow about things happened in protests, like teenage kids running to the frontline and adults chanting and clapping hands aside, as if they were sending paschal lambs, oh and saying ‘thank you young kids for saving us from bullets’. That scene disgusted me a lot, and I could never forget their faces. They were cowards who didn’t dare to stand up because they cared more about their jobs and money, but they’d rather let the minors and even 10-year-old kids fighting for them. And then they said thank you as if it could rinse their guilt and to feel like they’ve done something. And my therapist, who’s an immigrant from Hong who came twenty years ago, saying the exact same thing to me was just exasperating. I’ve already told her we never wanted compliments, but rather actual involvement. And that’s what frustrated us and left us moral injury. I was expecting a professional to help me face the past memories and emotions, and move the F-word on, because I still want to stand up and be strong again. But she was being too personal. So I found another psychologist (tbc)",Mindfulness journal #1

2022-11-03 11:59:46,depression,"CW: Suicide, discussion of suicidal thoughts

I don’t really know where else to put this, but I feel like I’ve exhausted most of my options up to this point, and I am simply at the end of my tether. If this post is not well written or organized, than I offer my apologies here in advance. Additionally, I apologize for its length/repetition, this post is the product of an I edit it’s, emotionally-charged typing spree.

I (M 22) am a college student who has struggled with autism and clinical depression/anxiety. 

Without revealing too many autobiographical details, prior to college an abusive parent and my status as a social outcast (amongst many other things) have provided me very little opportunity to experience life in really any meaningful capacity whatsoever. Even with a genuinely caring father who fiscally has done much to make sure that I could enter college, I simply have not been able to transform myself into a better person, or learn how to relate/understand the people around me. On top of this, a major bout of (then undiagnosed) clinical depression rendered the entirety of my high school years a dreadful, blurry haze. In short, up to entering college I had lived an unfulfilled, uneventful existence.

I imagined that college would be an opportunity for me to redefine and improve on myself, and in many respects it was. I developed close friendships and personal connections (something which I had never experienced before!), became active with various organizations on campus, and excelled academically. It seemed that, in spite of my past woes, I had learned to thrive socially and experience the intrapersonal relationships which I had long been denied.

Flash forward to senior year (I only have so much time to type out everything), but nearly all of my relationships have faded. And trust me, this is not from a lack of effort/attempts to put myself out there. Even worse, those whom I have remained close to have used my kindness/trust as an excuse to treat me with animosity and walk over me as they please. I once again have no one who understands or cares for me.

It seems that, no matter how much effort I have put into self-improvement or better understanding those around me, being autistic prevents me from developing any sense of intrapersonal connection or understanding of other people.

No matter how many people I interact with, how many situations I put myself in, or how much self reflection I do, I simply cannot change the fact that I am a fundamentally broken excuse of a human being. 

If my struggles were merely the result of temporary circumstances I would not be considering means as absolute as suicide. but given that I proven to be incapable of functioning in any given situation, as well as the fact that 22 years of existence has only enforced this worldview, this condition of mine seems to be permanent. 

I feel that I have run out of options, and my future circumstances do not provide room for some spontaneous opportunity to prove myself wrong. Hence, I am here writing on Reddit as a final resort before I go through with my deed. 

I don’t really know what to ask or say, but I needed to vent/type this, so if you are reading this than thank you.","As an autistic adult, I am seriously struggling to consider any option other than suicide at this point"

I joined reddit because I couldn't find anything online with people talking about this.

I want to start by saying I am very fortunate and I understand so many people don't have 1/10th the resources I have so please don't assume I'm out of touch or a jerk.

Essentially I make decent money (27 low 100k range). Live alone with my dog and have some debt but nothing crazy. My depression has gotten really bad lately and I've noticed over the past few years I spend almost all of my money on things just to get through my day. For example, I couldn't bear the thought of unpacking my new apartment after a break up so I paid someone to do it. I couldn't get energy to put up pictures, so I paid someone. Furniture, food, errands, shopping, pretty much anything I can pay someone to do I will.

Is this normal and what can I do to get out of this funk? I mentioned it to my parents and they said ""wouldnt you feel more accomplished if you did things yourself"".

Again I really hope I don't come off as ignorant to other people who can't do these things. It's just embarassing I'm a 27 year old male who basically spends every dollar just so he can do well for 8-10 hours at work then shut down completely.",Spending and depression

1996, the year i was thrown into existence, a brutal awakening it was. The fourth bastard child to a newly single mother. Looking back i wasn't particularly loved nor hated, simply forgotten. Like the lingering smell of rain after the showers have stopped, one could go their entire life without ever acknowledging the scent. 

This is how I've lived my life. Overlooked in every sense. Never the one people look for. I've always wondered what they would say if I were to take my life, as I've dreamed of doing countless time. The idea of it brings me pleasure, along with immense pain. 

The pleasure of relief, no longer having to live a life in the shadows. Always wondering why ill never be anyone's first pick. Why I cant seem to find connection, no matter how hard I try. Ending it all seems so easy, until it comes time to do it. Then I pause...will I regret it once its too late, will I only manage to injure myself and wake up to the worst pain of all, life. 

I never asked to be born and I've found myself resenting the life I was given. I move through life with the idea that I am unloved, unwanted, and strange. I watch in awe as those around me navigate this world with ease. They find meaning in life and create bonds wherever they go. I feel so far removed from it all. 

A stranger in this life and to everyone around me. Its ironic that I'm beautiful. People look at me and make assumptions. They believe I view myself in higher regards than I do them, when in reality that is not the case. Beauty can take you far in this world but it will never give you what you truly desire. Love, connection, affection. 

I move though life attempting to be as authentic and kind as I possibly can, yet I still find myself alone. Connections are fleeting in my life. I look around and there is noone looking back for me. For whatever reason I am proven right again and again. That I am in fact unloved, unwanted, and strange",Diary of the forgotten

every night for the last 2 weeks i’ve woken up at 4 am in a sweat. i am stressed out because my life feels bleak. i feel like i am not enough. 
i never really felt like i was enough. my entire life has been a constant battle with depression and suicidal ideation. i like to blame my addict parents or my cheater ex boyfriends. but at the end of the day it’s my fault and everything will always be my fault. i thought my current boyfriend was the answer to all of my problems, finally someone who is there for me and loves me. someone to teach me what feeling loved truly feels like. but no, he just walks all over me and uses me and makes me feel insignificant. and i take it because i feel so worthless and alone, that i almost believe i deserve to be treated that way. so i let him. because i am alone. 

i’ve finally realized that nothing will help me. i sometimes wish i killed myself years ago because then i wouldn’t have had to endure more pain. i don’t think life will get any easier for me. i don’t think i’ll ever be happy or wake up without wishing i didn’t. i am surrounded by more people than i ever have been in life and yet i feel the loneliest. i feel nothing anymore and i feel tired all at once, i don’t know how much longer i can do this.",4 am

I hope someone here can answer, I really feel all alone with this and it makes me really anxious. 


It started about 5 weeks ago. A new wave of depression and (I think) anxiety hit me. At first I was really depressed and felt sad all the time. I cried a lot, had no appetite, you name it. 


But then suddenly I felt numb: 
Everything I cared about: It just feels numb. 
I lost all of my passion for hobbies I once really loved. . Like I suddenly don't care at all?! Suddenly all my hobbies feel strange to me? 
Even talking to or meeting my friends I normally really care about just feels... strange? Idk I feel like I don't really live in the present. I live more inside my head and I can't do anything against it. 
It got so bad, that I barely go outside because if I do, I start to panic. I just want to hide in my bedroom all day and I have no idea how to continue going to uni.
I'm really afraid I will feel like this forever. It's just so unfair because before that I was doing awesome and was enjoying my life, friends and hobbies. Now I feel like I just want to throw away everything. :(

But now i cant understand anything even how hard i try. And thats very frustrating for me because ive always been fascinated by science. 

I feel like im going insane all alone in my room. I take classes on weekdays, and it is extremely hard for me to get up in the morning and go there. I just sit in the class all day staring at the wall , dont learn anything from the lessons. People keep staring at me like im a weirdo. Everything seems irritating to me. I feel sleepy most of the time. Especially during classes. I cant wrap my head around the things teachers say.

Ive been alone for years now, i dont have any friends. I got used to it though i guess. I dont know what to feel or what to do anymore. I dont have any sense of identity. I just feel like i dont exist. Ive been having distorted perception lately. My environment seems unreal. Objects seem as if they were too big around me. my body feels like a robot, mechanical.

2022-11-02 14:54:53,depression,"Hi. This is just me venting. (This might be pretty long)

Idk where to start.

So, I'm (25m) gay. And, recently found out I have HIV. I never had sexual partners and I never had sex before(or so I thought). I'm so in love with someone who lives in a different country we've been on and off with our communication in last 2 years because he said he can't handle a LDR. Recently this year, I was sexually assaulted by a co-worker (let's name him Ricky). He's a close friend and we usually hang out and I sleep in his apartment multiple times cause when we drink outside we end up getting home late and my apartment has a curfew.

He's a good guy. He's a father to a 2 year old but is separated from his partner. We got along because we work together and we play the same games. He usually ask me to drink with him wether it's in his apartment or in some bar. We are drinking with other co-worker as well so it doesn't really bother me. We've been really close since he told me almost anything and some problems he has and I'm there to support or hear him out.

Last May, we went out to grab a drink with our friends and I already told him I'm sleeping in his apartment which he agreed. We drank and talk a lot. Until, I was too drunk to the point that I don't remember much of what happened that night.

I remember waking up in the middle of the night with Ricky touching me in my private area and kissing my neck. I was too weak but I manage a groan and push him a bit until I blacked out again. I woke up a few times with him on top of me but I was too wasted to do anything. I woke up the next day without any memories, I even tried to wake him up to say I'm leaving but he was sleeping. I left.

When I went back to work, my other friend who's with us that night asked me if I was okay and I say yes. Then, he asked me if Ricky and I are a thing which I answered with a no. He told me that Ricky was being inappropriate with me when I was drunk. That's why he tried to bring me home, but Ricky said he can handle it. He talk a bit more about that night but I don't remember them. I was confused and shocked because I consider Ricky as my close friend and he would never do that. We went to work and I saw Ricky, suddenly I remember glimpse of what happened that night and I started feeling sick. I avoided him and went to the clinic. I asked them if I could go home and the clinic said yes. I went home crying as I remember bits of what happened that night. I didn't know what to do. Ricky messaged me but I ignored him.

A month passed and I'm still ignoring him. I just couldn't face him and I decided to quit my job. I went back to my hometown.

September, I received an email about my application to study abroad and asking me to process my documents and all. For some reason, I felt called to do HIV test before my medical exam and I did. It came out positive. It was all a blur, tests after tests. Apparently, the disease already compromised my immune system so the doctor said it's not possible that I got it recently, I may have had it for a long time. But, I haven't had sex before the assault. I was recommended to see a therapist to help me process everything, which I did.

In one of our consults, my therapist asks me questions until he said ""Is there an instance that someone touched you inappropriate as a kid?"" And, that's when it clicked. A memory I forgotten, I was molested as a teenager but for some reason the only memory I remember was the guy trying to abduct me. But, as we dig deeper into that I found out that I was indeed molested. It was years ago and it happened not only once.

I was torn. I replied to my emails saying I cancel everything: from applications to interviews. I'm torn. I went home that day crying non stop. I told the guy that I like that I have HIV because it's just the right thing to do. Of course, he was shocked and hurt. I couldn't tell him the real reason how I got it so I lied and told him I hooked up with someone because it's the only plausible explanation. Now, he left me. Which is understandable.

I'm so heartbroken. My siblings doesn't know about my disease they only know that I have to get my check up for my application abroad.

In the past years, I've been depressed and with no direction. But, this year I finally figured out what I want. Im depressed but I worked hard to go where I want to be and now I'm sick. I cancelled my application and my interviews. I'm almost there but this happened. Now, I have to deal with the trauma and the memory I no longer want to remember.

I didn't go back to my therapist after that. I just couldn't bear to do it.

The only guy I love, left. My dream of studying abroad is gone. My savings, gone. I'm sick and getting sicker.

I miss the guy I love. I miss talking to him.

I don't know. This feels like a dream, I wanna wake up.

If you reached this paragraph, thank you for reading. I don't know where else to share or to vent. I'm fighting for my life right now. It's been so hard thinking about the people and things I lose. But, I'll try to be strong. I barely lived my life and I finally wanna live but this happened. I'll still try, I'll fight, I'll be brave but for now I wanna cry and vent.",A relapse

Waking up everyday feels like an excruciating chore, I have heavy guilt for the pain I’ve caused those around me, those that I love as a result of my mood swings and other mental issues. I think the heaviest two pains I’ll take with me is the pain I’ll leave my mother in. She’s the strongest most beautiful soul I know, and she’s been through so much already and I’ve hold off as long as I could for her. But waking up is too much. Living in this loop is too much, I know I’m nothing but stress and burden on my family that I don’t fit in with, maybe I’m that sick in the head but I feel as I’m doing them the biggest favor. And the second biggest pain is my dear love. He also struggles with depression and we have our fair share of complicated past that we’ve been working through but again living has gotten to be too much. He’s such a beautiful person, the only one I’ve seen a future with, wanted kids and a family with. If I could turn back time and scold both of our younger selves to get their shit together, I would in a heartbeat. I’d go into therapy sooner and stay no matter how much I thought it wouldn’t change a thing. Maybe, maybe then things would be much more different, we wouldn’t have hurt each other, I wouldn’t have hurt him. He’s been one of the brightest lights in my life. He’s helped me in so many ways that he isn’t even aware of. I can still remember the first time I ever saw him. The first time we made eye contact, talked, say with each other in class, held hands, our first confession, our first kiss. I ran away like an idiot because I was so nervous. We always got kicked out of class together for talking. Spent time together in the school library. How I wish it was those simpler times. We’ve graduated about two years ago now. we’re more grown, more than we’d like because of the trials life’s put us through but we’ve made it this far, he’s made it this far. I’m so proud of him. God I’m honestly so scared. I’ve just finished writing my letters to those around me.

2022-11-02 13:57:24,depression,"Hello, I've known I'm depressed since I was young; going on about 20 years of dealing with it. I've cried over plenty of things: fights, breakups, weddings, generally things that are directly in my face.

But I've been dealing with some family shit recently and the tension has been rising. Got some backhanded comments from my dad and step mom (over dungeons and dragons of all things) and the only way my body is coping with it is this lump in my chest. Feels like a lead egg covered in jet fuel. I used to have anger issues when I'd feel like this, and while I've generally gotten over that anger I don't really have a way to rid myself of that heavy sense of dread. All I really wanna do right now is cry in my car and process the feeling, but for whatever reason I just can't cry when it's this specific feeling of dread. 

Maybe an even worse part is this feeling also makes me paranoid and ends up affecting how I interact with the world around me. If I cried I'd still probably feel sad but this weight wouldn't be so heavy and I could go back to processing the emotion. I've teared up a little while writing this, but I honestly can't tell if I'm actually crying or if I'm just so goddamn tired from both my busy life and the perpetual haze that's hung over me since I was a kid.",I really wish I could cry right now
2022-11-02 13:57:14,depression,"My boyfriend is currently sleeping next to me while I sit up crying, listening to music in the bed next to him. I’m having very depressing, intrusive scary thoughts. I haven’t been this depressed in a minute and it’s scaring me. I got the copper IUD today and that amongst other things has made it a not so pleasant day. I just needed to tell someone how I’m feeling so if you made it to the end of this post thank you for listening.",I’m scaring myself
2022-11-02 13:55:55,depression,"I have the best boyfriend in the world. He's caring and compassionate and loves me and is so incredible in so many ways. I've dealt with depression for most of my life and have been able to mostly manage and function like a normal person from day to day. But I moved across the country in August for school leaving behind everyone I've ever known. My anxiety got really bad after the move which made leaving my apartment near impossible which means I'm barely going to classes and I haven't met anyone or made any friends here. 

My boyfriend has been so supportive through it all. He's helped me through countless panic attacks, sat with me while I've had awful, awful fights with my parents, and has taken care of me the best he could when I could barely function. He's been my rock for months now and I love and appreciate him for it more than I can say.

I can tell though that it's so hard on him to not have the person he fell in love with. The other day he snapped at me in the middle of a panic attack I had in the morning because multiple days I've started his day with anxiety and it's absolutely draining for him to deal with constantly. He's made comments about how it's not good for either of us that I'm depressed all the time. He misses me. Hell, I miss me. And it's hard because I don't know how to get back to even being some semblance of normal. He told me that when I'm sad on the phone with him, he might as well be staring at a blank screen because all I can manage to do is scroll mindlessly through social media. And I know that I can be boring but just having him sit with me on a call is soothing on its own for me. I used to do that when I wasn't as bad. And now I feel like I'm just not enough as a partner. I feel like I don't know how to make him happy anymore. All I want to do is make him happy and see him smile and I'm scared I'm ruining this relationship because a lot of the time its nearly impossible to get the energy to be a decent partner.

I started therapy a few weeks ago because I want to be a better partner to him and friend to the people I care about but I'm worried that I'm going to end up pushing him and everyone I've ever cared about away. Anyway. Yeah. I just don't know how to fix things or make things better.",My depression is ruining my relationship
2022-11-02 13:52:30,depression,"I've recently fallen into depression because of college, and will be dropping out after the semester is over. However, it won't be over until December. I am finding myself being tired all the time and never leaving my room. I slept almost 15 hours today. I'm not particularly feeling upset, sad, or suicidal at all, just tired. How can I get out of this routine of constantly sleeping?",How to stop sleeping so much?
2022-11-02 13:52:19,depression,"I have no reason to keep myself alive , and yet somehow I continue to live. life has become an endless struggle , and my efforts are futile at best and  utterly exhausting at worst. There is nothing that brings me joy anymore.  I am living a lie, and if I could do anything, anything to make this false reality end, then I would. Yet, the truth is far simpler; my heart is broken beyond repair and all I can feel is pain. This is it. My final act of self destruction is complete ; death will be my release. 
It is in these moments that I have come to realize what is truly wrong with me. Yes, I have done things that were not right or appropriate. Many times, those things have made me question who I really am and why I exist. Perhaps they are the same reasons I chose not to change when I could have. The thought of dying now makes me uncomfortable in ways that I had never expected it to before. I don't know where I will go after death; I hope there are people who will find me worthy enough to give their own life for me if I ever did manage to die. 
For some reason though, my heart feels lighter than it ever had in my entire life. Is this just because I have accepted my fate? Perhaps I have finally found peace in knowing that I am no longer  deserving to live. It feels good to think so. If only it would last. It doesn't matter to me though, whether I die or live.  My life has been worthless since I was born anyways. It might as well end here. There will be no one else left to see it.",life is coming to an end
2022-11-02 13:38:23,depression,"I read a post on another sub where the OP said she was relieved to be diagnosed with PTSD because it meant that her symptoms and difficulty adjusting to life weren't her fault, but the fault of the person who abused her. And I guess I can see why that might be comforting to someone, but where does that leave those of us who don't have some traumatic event to use as an excuse for being mentally ill? I was literally just born like this.  

I had two childhood friends who both went though some awful shit as kids; one was put in foster care after her birth mother neglected her and the other was raped by his stepbrother. And today both of them are somewhat well-adjusted adults and living much more functional lives than I am. My parents were a bit overbearing, but they never neglected or abused me, and even though I wasn't that well-liked by my peers in school I wasn't bullied either. So I often can't help but see the fact that I struggle so much in my daily life as a sign of personal moral failure.",I wish I had some excuse for being mentally ill
2022-11-02 13:37:18,depression,"We work until we die, there's nothing to do when we're retired, and people like me spend hours doing absolutely meaningless nothing that only makes me lament existing even more. I don't hate me but I want out of here. When I express this grief and hardship, people suggest a new hobby or getting a pet. I have both. Everyone treats this kind of attitude like an elephant in the room and I'm sick of it all! Once legal euthanasia hits the U.S., I'm the first one signing up. Thanks for letting me rant guys I really appreciate the people I meet here.",My friends don't get it.
2022-11-02 13:35:07,depression,"This all started a while ago, when I was getting into watching a lot foreign films. I started to think things like ""I wish I could be there, I wish I could meet people like this."" Of course though, I can't. I don't have anywhere near enough money to plan a trip. Since then, that feeling has been swelling into a voracious negative outlook on everything and everyone around me, and I'm just afraid of taking it out on them.

My whole life story probably isn't in order, but I'm 22, I'm a college dropout who just couldn't keep up with the Quarantine dynamics, I'm supported by my separated parents, and I've landed a pretty easygoing job with co-workers I can easily call my friends. I definitely have it better than lots of other people. Everybody wants to have something, be someone, or go somewhere else, and I know I'm know different, but I've just grown to loathe everything that reminds me I don't have those things, including myself. I feel like I've been working for so long now and have barely anything to show for it, and a nagging doubt I ever will. 

I can't watch my movies anymore, or even listen to music. My chest just gets heavy with a covetous feeling toward whoever created it. Everytime I try to take a step forward, I feel like wherever I'm trying to go is never going to be there. If I ever try to do or create something, all the potential negative things people could say about are all I can think of. And anybody I might try to reach out to about these feelings would just wince and back away slowly, because that how I'd react. Even as I'm typing this, my head's telling me ""Oh good, he's going on Reddit and whining about his emotions, that's pathetic. They're people with actual problems on this thing trying to find help, and you're being an inconsiderate dickhead to them."" I guess all I want is to be a great, important person, surrounding myself with great, important people, anywhere that isn't where I am right now. I know stuff like that isn't supposed to just come true, but even knowing that, those visions kept me happy and motivated no matter what ends up happening. Now I've just completely forgotten how to do that, and I want to go back to it so badly.",How can I be content with where I am and what I have?
2022-11-02 13:35:03,depression,"I've written about this here before, but I'm feeling it again, way more intense than before...

You know when you're a little kid and you get put to bed, but you aren't tired? You ever pass those hours by staring out your window at night? I did. I used to stand on my tiptoes just to see over the windowsill. I'd watch the cars go by and wonder who was inside, what they were listening to, where they were going. I'd watch the neighbors' lights flick off, one by one, through the night. Sometimes people would walk down the street at night. Sometimes you could see the moon, or a smoking chimney, or animals lurking in the trees.

Everybody else is so close to you. You're no more than 20 feet from those cars driving by. You can see the smoke billowing up in the winters and imagine sitting by a warm fire all night. You could reach out and touch the rain... if only the glass wasn't there. You can see it all, but you can't quite feel what it's like to be out there. It's even worse when you realize that you've been outside before. You've felt the rain, the wind, the grass. Now, you can't. You're on the other side of the glass.

That's how I feel most days. I try so hard to do things I need to do, and to do things I think I want to do... and I don't feel anything. I go out, sit at the same tables as everybody else, eat the same meal, but it doesn't taste like anything. I sit by the fire and there's no warmth. I play a game with friends, and it's not a bad time, but I'm not having fun like I always used to. I'm right there with everybody else physically, but mentally, I'm the kid watching the world out his bedroom window. Life passes by, and I see it, and I sometimes even participate in it, but I don't experience it. It leaves no impression. There's always that glass keeping me insulated from feeling it all fully. I'm separate. I don't belong. I'm not wanted. I'm here, but I'm not really here.

That's what kills me. It's not that I'm sad all the time, because I'm not. It's that most of the time, I'm not *anything*, and then realizing that is what breaks my will to keep going. I'm like a waiter without tables. I have no purpose. I add nothing to the world, and I add nothing to anybody's life. I could die in my sleep tonight and it wouldn't make a difference. Nobody really wants me around, and I'm not really living anyway.

So I guess I'm still the kid watching the world through the glass. This world is beautiful, and the people in it are extraordinary, and I'm a part of it, but I'm not really a part of it.",I'm on the wrong side of the glass.

2022-11-02 13:25:13,depression,"Depsitw the girl making it extremely clear she wants nothing to do with me outside of work she always acts excited and hugs me everytime she sees me and because I have never recieved any particular kindness let alone physical touch I fell for her I think at least mentally cos physically i feel nothing but frustration over the fact that she's stuck in my head and come up with stupid and impossible what if scenarios that'll never happen.

I changed departments months ago but still see her 2/3 times a week because i have to deliver to her department, I was expecting her ""excitement"" and hugs to stop seen we don't work together anymore but it never did for some reason so I finally decided that I would stop allowing the physical contact hugs so that I could get over my delusions yet the other day when i saw her for the first time in a week she randomly jumped at me for a hug (which she has never done before) forcing me to catch her or she'd get hurt and now because of that my delusions have ramped up to a point where i can't even comprehend them the senarios make no sense and the chances of them actually occuring are physically completely impossible.

It's not even like she could have done it as a way to play with my emotions she couldn't have had any single idea of the fact that i was planning on not accepting hugs as i had literally only just started thinking bout it and made the decision recently in the last week so it's not like she could have seen any change in my behaviour as we hadn't seen each other in a week.",it's funny how delusions can get so much deeper from such a small action

But also my dad too, because he has paid for all my university courses. I’m not sure what to say to them when I tell them I want to change my course as a fourth year student.

They are all toxic and put me and each other down all the time and I don’t want anything to do with any of them. I don’t drink or do drugs and they all do both including my mom. They’ve called me a loser, say I’m going nowhere in life, put me down in other ways. Of course this hurts my feelings and I do feel like a loser. Its taken me a while to get to this point but I don’t want them in my life anymore. It’s beyond repair, without getting into too much detail.

2022-11-02 12:45:10,depression,"I have suffered with major depression and anxiety for a few years now. In 2020 I started Lexapro for my panic attacks which helped wonders - over time, I started not to enjoy some of its side effects and got off the drug in March of this year. At first I felt the best I had in years… but I had terrible withdrawals for months (physical and emotional) - shortly after getting off I got Covid for the #2nd time. Since then - I have dealt with daily unexplainable sadness. It’s truly terrible. I feel like I’ve lost my personality, I’m an artist and have no creative desire anymore, withdrawn socially, social anxiety— the only emotion I really feel anymore is sadness or random irritation or anger. (This was how I was feeling right before getting off Lexapro) 

It got to the point where I decided something is better than feeling this. I started Wellbutrin about one month ago. The first week I felt better(ish) but since then no change. I have noticed some rush of suppressed emotions that come out and I feel better after crying and it doesn’t turn into panic attacks. I’ve switched to exercising, yoga, and drinking a gallon of water a day. However - the unexplainable sadness and emptiness remains and I fear I’m stuck like this forever.

2022-11-02 12:31:51,depression,[removed],how did it end up like this
2022-11-02 12:31:18,depression,"Two straight years of the preferably final chapter of my life has brought me a generous amount of mental anguish and dread, and it ground me down to my fundamentals to a level that the truth has finally revealed itself, and I understand how it works now.

I deserve every ounce of every form of pain I have and continue to experience as a result of my shortcomings, failures, and wrongdoings.

Karma doesn't exist, but poetry does. Here's the poetic nature of my long-term destruction. I've found myself in a position where I'm to the point of slamming my head into walls and beating myself in the stomach with a baton, because of an incapability of art that I'm unable to faze.

Which was made several times worse when I discovered an individual in 2020 who, obscenely long story short, can be described as a version of me who didn't fail. Someone with a level of similar ideas and traits it's disturbing.

This is the important part. I was severely toxic in my comeuppance, and not only would I do the obnoxious and hurtful actions you would expect of a self absorbed crock of shit, but I also remember harassing actively developing artists for my own enjoyment.

And in the end, I get it now. I deserve this. Because of my foul treatment towards people who were just aspiring and following their passion.

Of course in the end, it was rooted from an internal jealousy that I was never equivalent to them as a person, neither in worth nor capability of beauty. I'm less valuable than unsustainable dirt, and that's exactly the place I should die and rot within.

As a result of letting every drop of my toxic core seep out and affect the unfortunate souls I came across, the world has sealed me righteously so, so I would molder from the inside out just like I always should have.

I slammed my head into a wall hard enough to see flashes in my vision last night, and I'm going to keep doing it. There's a reason it felt so right when the behavior started. This is what I'm supposed to feel for my mistakes and errors. I don't want anything to get better anymore. 

To remember when I made the futile attempts to get the ball rolling with drawing is something that fills me with utmost hatred and disgust, after the things I did and the discovery of the version of me who didn't fail. As if I was meant for anything of the sort.

My desperate push for the pathetic idea of salvaging any significance or future for myself in the area I wish for is something I regret sincerely. The concept I'm anything but an insufferable and revolting train wreck of a human being who never should've tainted the notion of artistic endeavor, is something I never won't feel guilty about manipulating people into not believing.

And the few times I would attempt something, scrambling to figure out what would work for me, I would go nowhere. And any mark I ever left was beaten down. This makes sense, this is what should happen. Every attempt I make at creating or just doing anything worth acknowledging deserves to be shot down however it needs to happen. 

Be it by other people, my circumstances, or just myself, and my laughable lack of passion or initiative that separates me from those with value. Such as the one I've envied for so long. The one who can do it all, who executed the ideas I've had for literal years, who's my age, who's actually going somewhere and deserved to shine through.

This is right. Almost. Watching every dream I have burning and shriveling away as I dissolve and assimilate into an incapable drone doomed to go nowhere as long as I live, while observing the ones meant to pierce through the barriers that perpetually imprison me is being incredibly merciful to the likes of myself. And it's a shame and inherently a crime that it's not worse.

It genuinely repulses me to think I'm considered part of the same species as people such as Einstein, Van Gogh, and Mozart. I've spent so long hating the world only for it all to finally turn around once I figured it all out. The truth is, I'm an unending disgrace to the only things I've ever looked up to, and my only dreams.

I deserve all of the agony I receive, be it physical, mental, or spiritual. And I deserve to die for my actions. Any situation where I feel I'm not receiving adequate punishment, I will bang my head on the wall. I will beat my stomach with my baton. And once I have the strength within, I will exit life.

My existence has been a stain on this Earth. Figuratively, AND literally an accident. No one deserved to endure my bullying and toxicity, nor my sobbing and whining for it biting me in the ass. The concept of art never deserved my abhorrent façade of being capable of bearing it with my own hands, nor my pitiful reaches of desperation for the idea I ever would've equated to the greatness I witness in those I envy.

To think of myself being the one to advance and execute my ideas and gain significance and skill, after the things I've done, it's an insult not just to art as a concept but the human race altogether. Now that I think about it, it's good that my suicide attempt in 2016 wasn't successful, I needed to suffer more to account for my crimes.

I never should have been a concept, and I wish nothing but the worst for myself when I extinguish from existence by my own hands.","I'm a disgrace to art. I deserve all of the pain I receive, and I deserve to die."

Trying college for Zoology didn't work, I dropped out in 2020 due to not liking the degree as much as I though. I thought about going to my community college near me but there is not many things I would enjoy doing that pay well.

&amp;#x200B;

English looks like fun since in High School I did enjoy it, reading is my favorite pass time and so is planning stories \[For short stories, games, etc\]

Film making would be nice but I need experience to get into the film school near me, and there is no experience to be gained in Colorado where I live so I'd have to move \[And I don't have the money to move lol\]

I enjoy playing video games and talking about things that interests me but if I tried going for youtube there is no prospect that it could even work, let alone be monetary.

  
I don't want to be stuck in a part time / full time job in Retail or Fast Food \[Did them for 2 years and hated my life\]. I don't want to work a trade since they get little to no social time, shitty labor in terms of physical pain later in life and just overall not interesting.

I'm not sure what to do with my life, its worrying and kind of depressing. Sucks when the only thing that interests me don't pay well or take years to even get to the point I want.

2022-11-02 11:43:35,depression,"I (20M) am in my second year of college. For nearly 5 years now, I’ve slowly had every meaningful relationship around me fall apart. First it was my parents, who for the past 5 years have tumultuously played around the idea of divorce; fighting, living separately, trying to make things work and then ultimately failing and always coming to me for support because neither of them have any friends. I tell them I can’t be their marriage counsellor or their therapist and that they need to look for outlets to manage the emotions that come with divorce and all I’m met with is (mainly from my mom) is that I’m a callous, cold-hearted piece of shit that doesn’t care about his family. A little over a year ago, I broke up with my now ex, we had been together for two years. She was my reason for staying in line. She hated drugs, every last one of them. She has a good head on her shoulders, knows how to take care of herself, knows what’s good for her and what isn’t. She was a seriously good influence in my life, and I loved her to death. She ended up falling out of love with me and stringing me along for the last 6 months of our relationship leaving me wondering what I did wrong or could have done differently. I’m close to hardly any of my friends from before college and am seriously struggling to find meaningful friendships in college. Coming to college I found some refuge in weed and alcohol but eventually had to recognise their destructiveness in combination with my horrible lack of self-control and emotional instability. So I cut those out. I’m in therapy, I’m trying my best in my classes but I just can’t cope. Everything I do that’s supposed to be good for me doesn’t work, or I can’t maintain it for more than a couple days. Every time I leave one distraction behind it’s like my brain punches me in the back of head and then drags me to another distraction and I’m just following its lead, feeling disoriented and directionless. For now I’ve settled on cutting and smoking cigarettes to help me get by, and I don’t even know how I rationalise that to myself. It just seemed to be the lesser of many evils, that would allow me to keep as much cognitive awareness as possible while still getting by with something. I have a bad feeling though, like this isn’t going to lead anywhere good. Maybe I’m just looking for the end of whatever fucked up road I’m on.

2022-11-02 11:42:59,depression,"So I did.myself a little test today to see if anyone would even notice. I posted a song about thoughts of suicide and the reason in doing so was to see if anyone at all even bothers to see how I'm doing or check what I post. Not one person even noticed. So this just confirms to me the only thing I seem to be good for is for people to use for financial gain. 

I've noticed for a while now the only time I'm called or even bothered with is when someone needs a favor or money. So I really don't know why I'm still here. This world really wouldn't be any worse off without me. At some point you get tired of fighting a losing battle and I think my battles is coming to an end.

i have no friends, only acquaintances. i don’t think anyone truly knows me or understands what i go through when i have a depressive episode, i hide it all. not letting anyone in, just perpetuates the loneliness i feel every single day. i just want to be loved but i feel so unworthy. the people i do tell, like my mom, does not understand &amp; she never has. she thinks i just need to change my “outlook” or “attitude” which pisses me off because if i could, i would.

being depressed makes me feel so weak. like i have no control over my mind or body. why can’t i just be happy? i am so privileged &amp; yet all i can do is ruminate on how miserable i am. like why the fuck can’t i get my ass out of bed &amp; do something? i don’t want to waste my life away but every day is a battle &amp; struggle &amp; i’m sick of trying so hard just to live.

i’m so lonely because all i do is spend time in my room. i’ve tried to make friends on campus by joining groups but i’m so awkward &amp; anxious &amp; i never speak up unless i’m spoken to. it’s not like i’m not trying or making an effort here, i really am but nothing seems to work out. 

being in college is the most depressed i’ve been. every day i want to drop out. i skip classes every week. i don’t have the motivation or energy to go. my mom is really pushing me to go &amp; there’s a lot of pressure from my parents to get a degree but i’ve been undecided for 2+ years changing my major 3+ times now &amp; i feel purposeless drifting through school. i want to take next semester off and just work, figure out what makes me happy &amp; maybe go back to school when i’m ready. 

anyone who can empathize or offer some wise words would be appreciated.

fyi: i’m on antidepressants (4 years now) &amp; am trying to restart therapy after i stopped because i was doing really well this summer. starting school really took a toll on my mental health",depressed college kid (22f)

I became a fraud, I practically made up my own life. I became the person I wanted to be and to them I was that person. So over time I started to become him. It was to the point I started to lose touch with the real me. Despite this I was a happy person, I had lots of friends, the most amazing girlfriend, loving parents. I was for the most part happy. Until something happened which I will refer to as ""The incident"". My entire life was flipped upside down. My phone was taken for a little over 8 months, I lost contact with all of my outside friends including my girlfriend. I saw her maybe once or twice every other week. I was cut off from the outside world other than my school. It was the lowest point in my life, I was very suicidal and I began to hate myself. School became the highlight of my day I  disappeared from everything else and lived out my fantasy life that I had fabricated. But the moment I got home I was miserable. My parents hated me, my girlfriend didn't love me, the only people I had were my friends but I was cut off from them.

my mental/emotional health is gradually declining as well as my physical health, although that has always been the case, as i’ve been a skinny twig for my whole life. we recently got some blood work done on me and turns out i have hyperthyroidism (possibly caused by graves disease), pretty common especially in my family. i noticed some symptoms of it started around the end of last school year, (always tired, anxiety spikes, and irritability) (the symptoms of HT that i’ve always noticed me having are things like being unable to sit still, trouble sleeping, and a very fast metabolism). because of this, i have very little energy to do ANYTHING, and i feel absolutely exhausted in the mornings even after getting a full nights rest. 

my girlfriend has severe anxiety attacks and tbh i believe she has bipolar depression. she’s constantly worried im gonna lose interest in her despite me never showing signs of that. and then she’s almost always bouncing between feeling worthless and being just fine. she recently started cutting herself and scratching herself. when i’m at her house and notice new marks on her i have her show me what she used so i can take it away, it’s usually a razor. she also called me today while she was at school having an anxiety attack in the bathroom and she told me she hit her head against the wall (purposefully), i honestly didn’t know what to say. i have to constantly reassure her and comfort her when she feels like this and it’s just so draining of what energy i have left. her family doesn’t have the money to get her a real therapist who doesn’t just prescribe her more meds that make everything worse. she lives with her father and they can’t afford good health care either bc her dad is illegal and her mom is just… not a good mother.

my father was recently diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis and i have no idea how long he has to live. he’s unable to provide for us so we rely on my moms nursing job. i love my father so much and i’m scared to lose him, im worried about what’s gonna happen to me when that time comes, im not ready to lose my dad. he’s one of the closest friends i have. i know that sounds dumb but it’s true.

it’s just ALL so much to deal with i feel like. 

i tried opening up to my parents about my problems and it seems like they understood at first, BUT THEN they just went straight to blaming things like my phone and video games, like they always have, it’s why i never open up to them. when i was in middle school/early HS video games were a big distraction for me and i was constantly skipping homework assignments. over the years i’ve lost interest in games and started playing guitar, i’ve stuck with it for years now and music is my favorite thing ever. i barely even play games anymore, only when im trying to distract my mind from getting lost in these depressing ass thoughts i have about myself. so, my dad says this when i open up to them “i’ve noticed you’ve been gaming more lately and that’s probably part of your school and mental health issues.” jesus fucking christ man can we move past this already? it’s not fair he keeps hanging that shit over my head. my mom then points out the hyperthyroidism and how it’s probably affecting me (THANK YOU) but then she bounces back to agree with my dad. what’s the point?? 

i don’t know… i’m really sorry for this long ass post but it seems like this is the last place available to me to get my thoughts out there, hopefully i can get some better, well-appreciated advice from you guys.

if it makes me sound a little bit less like a sad sack, like i mentioned i love music. it’s one of the things that keeps my spirits up all the time. i love to mosh at local shows, i love to chill while driving with music on, i love to make music with my band, i just love love LOVE music. anyway, if you made it all the way down here then i thank you for reading.",my life has become so overwhelming and i don’t know how to fix it. i just want to sleep forever.

2022-11-01 15:44:01,depression,"This is a disorganized jumble of nonsense and I apologize for that, but if you do get through reading this advice would be appreciated. 

So I've always struggled severely with thoughts of depression. The earliest I can remember having them was under the age of 10 and they have never gone away. I'm now 30 and I would say I have good stretches and bad stretches where in a good stretch the thought might come up once a week and in a bad one it's multiple times a day. It's a bit more than passive suicidal thoughts to the point that I genuinely plan it out down to the letter I leave, what clothes I'll wear, how I'm going to do it, I've even gone as far as putting a gun in my mouth. With that being said I have no intention on actually killing myself and don't think I ever will. As long as I have family living that would be hurt by it at least. Life in general is just exhausting for me and the thought of having to wake up every day and do it for decades to come is incredibly draining. By all measurements I have a good life. I exercise regularly, I have a dog, I've traveled quite a bit, I own my house, I recently left a very fulfilling job to go back to school and am getting good grades, I've had plenty of intimate relationships, have a good friend group that I mostly avoid until they make me hang out. At the end of the day the thought of suicide always comes back.

The last three relationships I've been in have all ended with the my partners telling me I need to go to therapy. I never discussed my suicidal thoughts with them, this was based mostly on my lack of ability to express emotions and attatchment. I'm not a robot, Im just very reserved in my emotional expression and feel (incorrectly) that my feelings of affection are understood through my actions. Two have also suggested that I probably have ptsd from work, but I'm fairly confident that's not true. My most recent relationship ended in a fight about me refusing to go to therapy. 

I had a pretty bad experience with therapy when I was a teen living in a residential treatment center and it kind of fouled the whole thing for me to the point that I have no faith that I would get anything from another attempt. For the last decade I think I've done a good amount of self work and gained a lot of self awareness and feel like Ive come to grips with my depression and accepted that it's just a thing that will always be with me. Im also not entirely convinced that being emotionally withdrawn isn't just as healthy as being emotionally open and expressive. Maybe relationships just aren't for me, not everybody has to find somebody and I usually don't mind being alone. 

A part of me does wonder if I'm just crazy and definitely need therapy? Are thoughts that have been with me for so long so consistently finally going to go away just because I talk about them with someone? If I've made it this far without acting it out doesn't that mean I have it under control? What could a therapist possibly say to me to change my mind that suicide isn't necessarily wrong? From reading this would you say I should find a therapist?",thoughts on therapy

2022-11-01 15:25:59,depression,"I've recently been given a notice that my business is being audited. The stress of it has removed all taste from food, I hug my wife and kids and feel nothing, it's like someone sitting on my chest at all times. What if I lost my invoices, what if I labeled something wrong and now I have to pay fines or even go to jail? Extreme I know but I can't help it. 

Now I'm reminded of the time I was 19, when I last felt this way. My high-school sweetheart broke up with me and it broke me. All I wanted to do is sleep, avoid friends and when I talked about how I felt people would avoid me. So naturally, I started drinking heavily with friends, it got so bad that I failed 2 years of university. I grew up in an abusive home and my dad had some money, but he used the money he gave us as an excuse to verbally and physically abuse the family and then drink for days. I wanted to quit university and start working but they convinced me to stay until I have a degree. 

At 24 I stopped drinking and completed my degree but struggled to be social and some weeks isolate myself in my flat. I then met my wife and we got married. I felt the same again when my dad passed. I don't drink anymore, I can have one beer and then be done with drinking for weeks without even remembering I have beer in the fridge. My wife also has been battling depression since I've met her and the drugs has killed our sex life. Feels like we've always been focused on her (she has a lot of health issues) and my mother (my dad passed and she could cope). I'm always there when they struggle. 

I've scheduled an appointment at a psychologist because the audit has made me think of suicide as an option which scared me as I have never felt like dying is an option. Have I been depressed this whole time and didn't realise my stress eating and masturbating was a way for me to self medicate?

2022-11-01 15:23:20,depression,"I have reached a state in my life where I don't get pleasure from anything anymore. 


I grew up in a family where my older brother was a semi God an I was a servant. My parents didn't let me leave the house to go out with friends until I was close to 18. They also shunned me for expressing my emotions, often laughing because I would cry or calling me a sensitive bitch.  My brother sexually abused me for more than 5 years, I tried telling my parents but they never believed me. 

I have prepared my whole life to be a successful professional due to family pressure. I went to school for more than 20 years and even got a Masters so I could get a decent job (to my parents standards). It was against my will but my family would not support me in following my passion (cooking). I ended up getting a good job and saving enough money to retire early. That did not satisfy me or made me any happier. 

In this process I moved to a new country and started a life away from my family, which helped me. I started dating my (ex) wife and got married at 22. She was the love of my life but she left 5 months ago to be with a coworker, after 7 years that we were together. She took our pet with her and won't talk to me anymore. Each day that passes the pain gets worse, and the drug abuse higher. 

I lost my residency status in the country I currently live and will have to move away in 2 months, after finally settling down and having a good group of friends. I don't want to go back. 

Most of the family members that I care about back home died or are close to dying. I couldn't do anything about it, being thousands of miles away and not able to leave the country (I would not be able to come back if I had left, resulting in loss of job). I traded financial security in exchange of being with my loved ones. It was not worth it. 

I plan a trip every month to try to get out there, I have many friends asking me to hang out with them in a weekly basis, I volunteer at the dog shelter, I go to therapy, I work out somewhat regularly. None of these are appealing  nor bring me joy. 

In summary: I am a financially independent person that has zero emotional IQ and many love frustrations. My confidence has been non-existent, my will to socialize reaching zero, and I cannot stop thinking of how I have wasted all 27 years of my life. 

All this has put me into this paradigm: What is the point of life if you can't enjoy it? I don't think I would be capable of doing it but each day that passes, that possibility becomes more and more appealing.","Not sure what I fear more, living or taking my life"

Im always here for him and we do lots of fun things together like playing baseball, riding electrical scooters downtown, and even going to get food together. 

I told him that im always here for him. My other brother and parents always let him know that but he just doesn’t open up. I tear up just thinking about it. Hes the baby of the family.

Our parents do verbally fight often. And we’re not close to any other family since we’re pretty much the black sheep of the entire family. He does get extremely upset and punches holes in the walls when he gets his electronics taken away due to grades or behavior. Id hate to think that he cuts because of stupid xbox or his phone. I made him realize that its not smart to do very permanent actions such as cutting and leaving scars over things that are so temporary and meaningless such as youtube or texting friends. 

The other day I was updating his phone and realized that he was messaging a girl that he barely knows and telling her that he was depressed and wanting to do more self harm. Man, my heart dropped.

So I was constantly fighting either I wasn’t black enough just bc I’m light skin and bc my mom was gay so they thought I would be to. I was a yes ma’am kid a respected my mother. For a while it was just us to and we were homeless sleeping on the bus just to make sure we were safe until my stepmother came into our life. Throughout school I played sports and always worked some type of job. High school was when things really took a toll on me. The first school I went to had a pretty bad rep. while I was in middle school I had a in a my high school I was going to be attending, with the girls varsity basketball the coach was my godmother so I was playing with them throughout middle school. So when high school came I knew all the popular girls. I was the only freshman at my year to do you that . So you made a lot of enemies got into to many fights so I had to change schools. The next school went to was the complete opposite. Let’s just say mommy and daddy gave their kid new Range Rover and the last school I was at had a clinic on campus, so I didn’t really fit in although I was popular because I stuck out so much. So you know I took advantage thought them boys how to shoot dice in the bathroom, making them use their cars for illegal steer racing all this making me more popular even stared dating the foreign exchange students Brazilian, German, Italian etc. all of this and I come home to my stepmother blowing up on me and even shoving a loaded gun in my face because I’m not doing school her way, constantly telling me I would never walk cross the stage. I end up graduating with a 3.2 GPA and she did even say a word to me on my graduation day. She ended up leaving not even a year latter. And for about two years I try use to do things the right way go to school get a job all that stuff. But I don’t thinks society wanted me in that way, so I became a typical hood nigga and It was going good until two of my people got killed and I promise my mother and unborn child I would never again.

I also need to learn coding in 3 weeks and code a simple game.

Im so lost. i skip lessons and dont go to campus. I got no friends or money. Sleeping helps me escape for a brief period of time.Seeing people on campus being happy and enjoying the best times of their lives gives me so much anxiety and that is why i stopped going.

Money is low, i’m 2k in student debt, My bills are ruining my financial life, oh the list goes on. My mom passed away last year and at first I felt nothing although she was everything to me. My past full of trauma and abuse caused what most call normal emotions to vanish even at the young age of 8. I shed maybe a handful of tears at her funeral. And a few months ago I went through A long night of crying and mourning. But besides that I felt nothing. I have been this way for years now. I never cry or even feel remorse at the news of people dying or going through hardship. I think its strange how when I post my true feelings, all my so called friends that see my post watch but never respond, not even a “hey I’m here for you” .

I think I have bipolar disorder but I haven’t gone to get it checked out. I recently turned 20 and it just made me sad. I feel like I can never properly enjoy something. I try to live in the moment but I basically remind myself that this moment will pass and before I know it it’ll just be a memory. My life is basically flashing before my eyes and I’m trying to hold on to enjoy it but it feels like Im failing. I miss being younger. I have so many regrets.

On December 25th, 2021 Christmas day, I made a promise to myself that there was no turning back to going back and forth on my faith. I made it final to myself that I was an  atheist. I felt free. Paranoia of God cascaded away from my mind. However, it welcomed the fact that my death was final and I was worthless. Being 12, it was hard for me to accept such a harsh reality. a during the months following I gradually lost my favoring for any sort of morality. nothing matters. Such words that I would play in my head continuously. By the time summer came, I still felt value in my life. Frankly, I thought my mindset was better than those around me. I felt freedom in my life. I set goals for myself and whenever I failed to meet them, I never felt guilt. I was losing sympathy for people including my family. As summer reached its ending, I was a total apath, living with anhedonia. I was living life on airplane mode. Family trips meant nothing as I felt nothing. During my progression through summer, I felt myself eating more and more, craving nothing but to be satisfied which I never felt. I craved to feel anything.  I didn’t feel miserable just empty. As it is now autumn, I’ve thought deeper just as I started in August. My friends and family mean nothing to me. I don’t feel pleasure from  anybody’s company. I admittedly fantasied  about killing off everyone just because I can’t accept my insignificance to this indescribably surreal world. I’ve lost my empathy. I never feel happy or sad. Maybe I have but it never lasts. I don’t care about anything really. I just care about the possible reason that can help me be normal again when I can be happy and even be sad. That’s how i’m alive. Many say people turn numb as a result of emotional pain but I really never felt that. I have what is considered a good life. Yet somehow I feel extremely lonely. Nobody, even someone who shares the same mind as me could soothe me. Every view I have on life depends on their significance which nothing has. I have no reason to live accept wait on the future. They say it gets better but it’s so hard to think in a different mindset I can’t just be thinking finding comfort in people and making friends or doing what you love can help this. It doesn’t. They don’t do anything. Seeing life as an astronomical experience is no good route either. I don’t feel anything is worth anything. I know I’m 13 and I’m “so young” to be worrying about this but what is there really there waiting ahead of me? Nothing with the possibility of something.

2022-11-01 12:19:29,depression,"Just gonna write this out in the hopes it will help me. 

My life was a joke when I was in my teens to early 20s. I didn't realize it at the time, but anxiety was slowly destroying me from age 14 onwards, to the point that I no longer felt like a real human being. I lost all of my friends and isolated myself so much that I genuinely felt I didn't deserve to have any friends. That it would be weird if someone wanted to be the friend of this almost invisible creature who was not quite human.

Depression came on eventually, as it usually does with long term anxiety, because of the growing sense of hopelessness. I felt so inadequate socially. At a time in my life when I was supposed to be enjoying myself on a Friday or Saturday night, I was shut away in my bedroom with a crushing sense of embarrassment and complete social failure. The thought of 'going out' for the night filled me with dread and fear. On the rare occasions that I did go out with workmates at night, I felt inadequate and uncomfortable while others were 'hooking up' or just having a good time. Not to mention the ever-present anxiety that was never far away, though slightly dulled by alcohol.

But that's not all. Earlier, in school, I developed fixations on individuals which manifested in extreme jealousy, sometimes because of looks, other times I'm not quite sure of the reason, though it seemed like it might be bound up with my sexuality. It was exhausting to have to trudge through a constant mental obstacle course, thinking about a particular person and trying to analyze, in a wholly incompetent adolescent way, why they were constantly there on my mind. Together with the anxiety and feelings of not being a 'full' person, my own personality was being shoved to the side to make way for all of this junk in my head. This went on for about a decade.

And then things changed.

No one is more surprised than me to find that my life turned around. I got married, which was something I thought would never happen to me in a million years. I have two wonderful, beautiful children. Again, high unlikely for someone as socially inept and lacking as me. I started a small successful business, which provides a good income, more than I dreamed possible for someone who dared not to go to college because he was just too anxious and pathetically awkward. From the outside I have a good life. I am grateful for it and it has exceeded the wildest dreams of my youth.

And yet.

So much remains in my head. The social awkwardness, though better masked, is still there. Second guessing what I say and do in public is exhausting. I have singularly failed to make male friends. It doesn't bother me as much as it used to. I have accepted my introversion, but there are occasions when I see guys talking and building social connections with each other and I feel so very alien to that world. I've never fitted in there and I doubt I ever will. It pains me sometimes and is one of the great mysteries of my life. Perhaps the most difficult thing is that the 'fixation on individual A' thing comes along now and again. I've self-analyzed it to death, and believe it to be a projection of my perceived inadequacies onto another individual who I perceive as in some way superior.

So what does this mean? Well, yes it does get better. I would love to go back to my young self, and watch his wide-eyed amazement as I tell him of my life's 'accomplishments'. But it would be hard to also tell this guy that the mental battles more or less remain, and that he will have mental breakdowns and periods of severe depression that will require ongoing medication.",An Unexpected Life

2022-11-01 11:56:05,depression," 

Sorry in advance for the wall of text for anyone reading this.

Pre-pandemic when I was in high school, I was already pretty awkward and socially anxious. But I had a large group of friends then, with a few closer friends as well. But being at college for my first semester and first time bring constantly around people my age for over 2 years, I realized that all of my social skills have completely tanked. I never had a chance to practice them much during the pandemic, as I only really talked to/hung out with friends that I already knew from high school.

At this point, all of those friendships have faded away, and I was counting on myself to make new friends at college, which is one of the reasons why I wanted to go in the first place. But two months in, I have yet to make a single friend. How sad is that? It's not a mystery why, since I don't usually speak too much unless spoken to when in class, but i was sort of under the impression that it would just happen somehow, as stupid as that sounds.

My 2 roommates are the only people I talk to on a consistent basis, but I wouldn't consider myself friends with either of them. We get along well, but I mostly just keep to myself. Even though i'm 19 and around the same age as the people in my classes, they all seem so much more mature, interesting, and put together than I am, which makes me feel like im not as grown up, so I can't relate to them much.

This entire year has been the most depressing and lonely year i've ever had. My and my best friend who I bonded so much with last year drifted apart a lot, and it feels like I can't be myself around him anymore, so we don't hang out too much anymore. The first relationship that I had where I thought that I truly loved someone also ended this year, which was really hard on me. It sucks to have bonded so much with one person just for them to move on from you. I don't really have anyone to talk to anymore.

I just want to meet a friend who I can be my genuine self around and not have to put up a persona. Someone who I can talk to about anything, and get close with. Hopefully, next semester I can begin to develop something like that. Thanks for reading.",So tired of being lonely
2022-11-01 11:53:34,depression,"I’ve been deep in a depressive cycle for a while now. I was doing some journaling earlier today and was working through some of my feelings around knowing that in a room full of people, I would never be picked. I realized that, for me, I’ve never felt loved or felt cared for because in order to get those feelings, there had to be a transaction of sorts. 

For example, in order for my parents to love me, I have to do things for them to show my love for them. I have to prove I’m worthy and prove I am good enough for their love. I have to be generous with my gift giving because that’s how I show my care. Sure, my parents will now say they love me, but I don’t feel loved. 

With my ex partner, if I wasn’t giving all of my time, attention, and body (yes you read that right) to him then love and care was withheld. Then I became hard to deal with, unpleasant to be around, unstable. When I did all of the above, whether I wanted to or not, then I was shown care and love. Again, I was told I was loved, but I never felt loved. 

Now I’m in long term therapy trying to fix myself and take care of my mental health. This person says they care about me and I feel cared for. Except…it’s a transaction. I have to PAY someone to care about me. How sad is that.  And you know what the worst part is? I care about them immensely- I promised myself to never get attached, and here I am attached. This is how I constantly get hurt. 

My life is empty and pointless. On the surface, I look like I have it together: a good job, financial stability, some close friends, a dog, a generally grounded attitude…but really I’m empty and isolated. I care a lot about the people around me - I invest a lot of time and energy into people I care about hoping they do the same. It’s all transactions. I put in something hoping for some kind of output. I set myself up to be hurt and disappointed each time because I can’t provide that for myself.

I’ve tried most things (except medication, because I don’t think I have MDD, if anything I feel like mood stabilizer meds not SSRIs would help because I feel as if I may have bipolar II).

Since then I’ve gotten help and therapy and things have been better. However for the first time since then I’ve really been feeling those feelings of isolation and hopelessness and feel like I’m letting everyone down around me.

I’ve also been very curious about SH recently but it’s not even my own thoughts they just kind of come out of nowhere if that makes sense? Usually after the feeling of being useless.

2022-10-31 15:21:16,depression,"Feels like a guarantee that nothing will change for the better from here on out, and the only ""changes"" that happen are forever for the worse.

And I'm really tired of trying to bring this up to friends or family, because I'm only bothering them. They have real problems to deal with. Complaining to them and crying about my life and problems that are nowhere near as bad as theirs only serves to stress them out more and waste their time.

I feel like it would be a bad idea to see a therapist. I can already guess what they would do in my situation. They'd try working me around it. Trying to get me to just live with it, to cope with it. They can't undo the art pains I have.

For about two and a half years now, this same thing has haunted me. And as much as I love talking about it, I'll admit it for once that this is merely the straw that broke the camel's back. I already tried shooting myself in 2016. And I failed.

It's the single biggest regret of my entire life. I could've been nonexistent by now. I wouldn't have had to experience an ounce of the envy. I wouldn't have had to find a version of myself who didn't fail in every aspect. I wouldn't have had to witness my ideas and desires already executed and perfected. I wouldn't have had to end up slamming my head into walls out of the frustration, the anguish, and the emptiness it all brought onto me from then on.

I have no passion, and I can't force it either. So I can't enjoy the process. So I won't just do it, and I won't go anywhere.

It's like the universe is looking me dead in the eyes, and asking. ""Why haven't you necked yourself yet?""

Because I'm scared. It's because I'm scared. No amount of being pissed off and resentful of the universe for existing will make me feel even slightly comfortable or entitled to something that isn't just more bullshit waiting patiently on the other side.

Even if I somehow pushed through this passion barrier of mine, it'd be years of work before any of it looked tolerable. My ideas can't even be considered my own anymore. And awful free-time lacking adult life is kicking in, in a world that already provoked a suicide attempt out of me before any of this art crap, way back when I was just 14.

I'll say it yet again. Everything I should've been is already out there. And I'm not exactly puncturing a hole in the art spectrum with my death, or just lack of contribution.

I'll never write anything worth reading. I'll never compose anything worth listening. I'll never draw anything worth witnessing. I'll never do anything worth acknowledging.

And yeah, I'll never do these things for sure if I'm dead. And if I'm gonna die anyways, why not try? So I tried.

I tried once, it felt awful. Soul-draining, tiring. I ended up going nowhere, and haven't touched drawing for 8 months now.

Then I tried again, something else. Doesn't work, my circumstances forbid it. Probably wouldn't have gone anywhere anyways.

And then I tried again, something else. You know what it got described as? ""dime-a-dozen"" ""boring""

And I couldn't agree with them more, because that's just what happens when I try to do anything. Not like it would've gone anywhere in the end, it depended on me being capable of art, but I'm just a complete failure.

Everything sucks. I hate it all. Nothing interests me anymore.

My only dreams are perpetual infeasibilities.

The days of having free time and getting enough sleep to make waking up worth it are long gone.

I wish my dad loved my mom.

I don't want to die. I don't want to do anything anymore.

I just wish I never existed.

2022-10-31 14:03:24,depression,"Hey dudes!! I’m 13, almost 14 ( Male ). I just wanted to get some feelings off my chest and I don’t know who to tell. If you’re still reading this thank you so much, you don’t know how much this means to me. Now this is going to be very unorganized but regardless i’m still doing this!!

I don’t know where to start this off but I suppose i’ll state my biggest problems. I lost my best friend and another major problem I have was fucking up with the dream girl. Both hurt a lot but I think the girl has a greater influence on me. I met the girl in October of late last year btw. Anyways what happened with the girl was that she was really good friends with my life long enemy and she spread disgusting rumors about me sexualizing my crush to the max. My other so called friend gives false proof and the rumors are believed to be true by basically everyone. I lost so many friendships it’s not even funny. This happened December 13 of last year and the story doesn’t even end here. My friend from a different school that doesn’t even know her ends up talking to her and develops a crush on her very quickly. This was in February of this year but flash forward to the last couple of months. She keeps taunting me about it in smart ways because she knows i’m not over it and wants to exploit my pain in any way because she really wants me 6 feet under. Moving over to my old friend, him and I were really close until he started to talking to some “online thugs” and was changed. He started becoming a dick and this all happened during early quarantine so like march of 2020. He eventually became a dick and I couldn’t stand him so I just stopped talking to him while trying to remain friends if that makes sense. Anyways these are my biggest problems, i’m willing to go into further detail if anyone wants that.

With all that being said, I suppose I just want to be happy. All my friends seem to be getting some “rewards” while I just sit here rotting away while waiting patiently for people that wont even arrive. They keep talking bout their new girlfriends or their accomplishments and it just makes me want to destroy something. I know this is very selfish but I just wonder why they get this and I don’t? 

I also very enjoy the feeling of nostalgia. Nostalgia to me is the best feeling ever, it invokes a sad feeling but you’re glad you had the feeling. I also love liminal spaces!! I think this also comes from just missing when times were better, like when I was a kid. Even though i’m still really young I miss it. I used to be the happiest person on earth. My life is like a duster song, Stars will Fall to be exact. I used to be so happy and couldn’t even imagine being depressed and all that stuff but now everyday I have the urge to fucking kill my self.

I’ve also had anxiety my whole life. I feel like this is very common but this doesn’t help at all. I can’t even speak to people and I just phase out in the middle of conversations. I also think I have slight insomnia. I say this because I get 2-4 hours of sleep every night. I’m always tired but I can’t ever really sleep. I also think I have slight schizophrenia or just maybe some hallucinations but I have them a lot, like everyday. I think the “insomnia” causes the hallucinations. The hallucinations are just distant people from my past and I can even conversate with them and it feels so real. When I sleep I always dream and when I dream it’s always bout the girl. Good or bad dreams it still involves her in some way. Only source of happiness but it sucks when I wake up and then I drift back to reality.

I also moved away recently from my old hometown where i’ve lived my whole life and I miss it so much. I fricking hate my new area and I just can’t stop thinking of my old area and the people. I don’t want to make new friends. I don’t want to restart. I went back this weekend with my mom and I hung with my old friends and it was awesome dude. We had hella fun and even had the cops called on us!! I had finally felt so alive again!! But then I saw the girl again. At the time I didn’t know it was her but I thought it was her and just started at her and she started back. It was really dark but I was so sure it was her. Then today, on her social media it proved it was her. This makes me happy and said but I dont know why.

Anyways if you’ve made it this far you don’t know how much this means. Thank you.

Now I wake up every morning looking forward to my death. I say this because I don’t have anything to look forward anymore. Every day is constant pain and wishing for the better things in life. Im drunk with hope for the better things dude. I really want to kill my self but I don’t want to hurt the other people around me and part of me wants to stay. That part of me that wants to stay thinks it’s gonna get better but it really isn’t. I plan to do it soon but again part of me doesn’t want to. If anyone could help me that would be amazing. THANK YOU FOR MAKING IT THIS FAR.

Anything in the comments would make my life better. Thank you everyone!",A massive vent contains all my thoughts.

Life in recent years has not been very good with a lack of friends, skills, goals, money. I've realized just how incompetent I am  and how my former dreams are now impossible to reach. I've lost sense of right and wrong. The monotony of every day has taken it's toll on me and I often feel a world without me would be more ideal and peaceful for me and others around. Although death is scary to me as when I die very little people will care and I have done nothing that people can remember me by.

2022-10-31 13:47:40,depression,"I don’t have any aspirations or desires, I just exist. Sure I breath, eat, and sleep, but I’m not really alive. Just sort of there. A husk. 

When I was a kid, I remember being excited to grow up and be an adult but now all I want to do is sleep. I’m so tired of just scraping by. Why do we bother with this existence if all we do is claw our way through life feeling unsatisfied and exhausted? I have struggled with depression since I was 12 years old, and it doesn’t seem to be getting any better. Things don’t bring me much pleasure but neither does company. Nothing seems to bring me any semblance of emotion. The only reason I haven’t killed myself yet is because I don’t want to possibly hurt my mother (although my death may be more a blessing than a curse to her. I’m sure I’m emotionally draining as hell to live with.) I have nothing to live for. I only exist so I don’t cause further pain.

2022-10-31 13:44:23,depression,"I turn 22 on the 1st, and honestly am the most miserable I've ever been. I work with lots of girls either just finishing up high school or have just graduated, and we have a lot of down time to talk. They talk a lot about their lives and what they're doing on their days off, but then there's me. I go home, and I lie in my bed scrolling through my phone being miserable. I don't enjoy sports or video games like I once did. I have no friends and I have no car to really get out (I want to, but parent's just don't take me out to get experience). I have no plan for my future and don't know how to get one set because I'm so indecisive. I've had one coworker ask me a few times why I look so sad on any given day, I always kind of brush the question off, maybe smile or something just because I don't want to show how badly I am hurting inside. Other coworkers will ask me about other stuff like ""what I'm doing for my birthday"" or if ""I've did anything fun recently"" and I don't have anything to share because I just don't do anything. It makes me feel awful knowing I'm not enjoy anything or doing anything. I've had to stop and refocus myself a few times while working because I can feel I'm just about to break. The only real positive I have going for myself right now, is I have a decent amount of money, just nothing to spend it on and no one to spend it with.

My life consists of waking up and going to work 5 (sometimes 6) days a week for a full 8 hours and coming home and either watching a show or going straight to sleep to do it all the next day. And the sad part is, it's the most enjoyment I get now. I can't really explain why, but it is, even if it's not much. The days I have off are the ones I hate the most because I'm bored out of my mind and can't figure out a solution to my problems. And it probabaly doesn't help that I haven't had more than 6 hours of sleep in months.

I just can't think straight with everything going on right now, I want help, but don't want people to feel bad for me. I have hope things will get better, but I don't see it, and I don't know how to force it.

I’m trying to talk about college, I’ve been trying to talk about it with her all day. But she was cooking dinner and she kicked me out the kitchen and later on in the night my sister came over and she’d rather talk to her and was constantly telling me to get out. And now, 12:30 AM I finally have her to talk and she’s on her phone the whole time.

I’m starting to realize most conversations with her are very basic and any conversations I try to emotionally invest in she doesn’t engage. No back-and-forth, just her listening if she’s even doing that. she’ll get annoyed with me if I talk too much but that kind of happens when she’s not responding back or when I have to repeat myself because she’s not paying attention.

I’ve tried to address this several times but I think each time I do if she cares a little less. I’ve tried to address this with counselors but she’s always been in the room and either gets the chance to talk before I do and makes up lies about me being aggressive or she downplays it.

It’s really weird, she constantly calls me her favorite I don’t think she actually likes being around me.

She doesn’t understand my hobbies, just assume things about me and when I tell her she’s wrong she can’t help but think she’s right and disregards what I said.

I tell her no if she does it anyway, she even pushes my physical boundaries when I’m uncomfortable with her seeing me naked. She’ll tell me she can she wants to. She’ll touch me when I don’t want her to, and say she can.

2022-10-31 12:33:07,depression,"I (20F) have had a rough time these last few years. Part of this is due to me being too immediately trusting of people -- I assume everyone has good intentions with me, and it's led me into some pretty horrible situations that I have been lucky to get out of. I was pretty sheltered growing up, and when I got my first taste of ""freedom"", things went off the rails. I have healed from some of the things I have been through. Others have been ongoing and a personal hell to deal with. I don't think I'm 100% an idiot, but when it comes to social situations and understanding other people, I'm not that great. 

I was hospitalized as a young girl for an extended period of time for medical issues. I was bullied a lot in elementary school and middle school, and it got worse in high school when I put too much merit in the friendships and relationships that I did have and ended up ruining them, then felt like I could do nothing right and shutting myself in for the rest of high school. I finished high school online and didn't really socialize for the last two years I was in it at all. 

Now that I'm in college and back in the ""real world"", I trust people too quickly, be it friends, boyfriends, people I meet online, or anybody. I think for a while I was desperate for any connection after feeling alone for so long, but it has become a habit over time. Eventually, though, the overthinking sets in and I self-destruct with my friendships. I'm way too trusting in relationships as well and have done things that make me question my own mental sanity. I have seen horrible, horrible things happen to me and maybe naivete isn't the right excuse for it; I know what my bad decisions are when I'm making them, but I've reached a point in my life where I don't really care if I'm making dogshit decisions because my life will be terrible either way it feels. 

I don't think my friends now really like me. I don't think I'm unlikable as a whole or right off the bat -- despite everything I've been through socially, I'm told that I'm charismatic and fun to be around. However,  I think after enough time around me, people get sick of me or I just do some stupid, self-destructive shit for no reason and ruin a perfectly good relationship. With my current friend group, I think they're just beginning to realize how strange of a person I actually am and that realization is setting in. I feel like I moved too fast in one of my current friendships and now it's awkward and kind of weird. I think that's part of the trusting people too quickly thing because now I'm not even sure if I WANT to be friends with this person. Maybe that's just how I feel about myself. 

I'm reaching this point in my life where I want to be alone all the time, honestly. Being social and going out and socializing with my friends drains me in a way that it didn't use to. I think about cringe-worthy past social experiences and I am filled with dread. I spend loads of time with my loving, caring, and optimistic boyfriend but I am worried that eventually, he will get sick of me too. I'm sick of having to live with myself.

I don't know how to improve the state of my social relationships. I feel them slipping away from my grip which I might be okay with. I can't tell if that's a sign that things are getting bad again or not. I wish being social could go back to being easy like it used to feel, but now it's some complex game that no matter what move I make, I always lose. 

That might have been incomprehensible. Anyway, that's all I have to say. My head feels jumbled.",I'm too naive for my own good and trust people too quickly and I think it has ruined my life.
2022-10-31 12:31:22,depression,"I’m 25 living with my mom currently. I have depression and a bunch of other diagnoses. Keeping my room tidy is difficult for me. The most difficult thing is keeping my clothes hung up because I don’t have a dresser. Sometimes I do keep it tidy but right now I have had a clothes pile for longer than a week. 

My mom keeps getting annoyed and upset with me about my clothes pile. When I was little and she would be upset about my messiness and I did clean, half the time it wasn’t good enough for her. So I just really hate cleaning, it reminds me of when I was little and even when I did clean she was still upset. She does not get upset anymore when I do clean but I can’t let go of that thought process.

She has insinuated that depression and mental illness is an excuse and I’m just lazy. Idk what to do and I’m so tired of arguing with her. Do I just have to try my best to force myself to keep my room tidy? She is letting me live with her for free so it seems fair and that’s all she really wants from me…",It’s hard for me to keep my room organized and it upsets my mom

2022-10-31 12:20:23,depression,"I have been writing daily journal/diary for a while and I noticed that there's always either nothing in my head or full of negative/intrusive thoughts. My journal is never a total happy day. Maybe I'm happy for a certain amount of time but once a get some thoughts I will often go down in a spiral. 

I would say that my past has affected me a lot more than I think, I have gotten into depression for an entire year before because of a friendship.  I am still bothered by my past in a way and there are things that I have done that I can't forgive myself for, and one of the mistake is something I can't accept even though my partner has forgiven me. I did have some real event ocd because of what I did and even had false memory ocd at a point in time.

There are days or just the next hours/seconds after feeling sad, I feel positive and motivated, but that feeling don't last much. I find myself dreading to go to work, I feel so difficult to find motivation, I don't feel that I know what I want in life, I don't have a clear plan, I don't feel I deserve my partner's love especially after a mistake I made that I cannot forgive myself for. I feel ashamed and regret that I done something to someone that I love so much. 

I don't know if anyone feels this way here, I do feel ""disassociated"" in a way. This has been on for years honestly. I have a hard time focusing in conversations, even with my friends, family, partner. Sometimes, I can't understand what they are saying or feel they are speaking too fast during the conversation. Most of the time I can actually forget what they said right after a conversation or even during the conversation. This also makes it hard for me to study. 

I have been seeing a psychologist for only two sessions as of now, I wish I can go every week because I feel I need it. However its expensive so i just have it twice a month. I don't earn much and going twice a month restricts me from saving as much as before.

I don't really think I can explain in detail here about myself and I can't 100% confirm I have depression because I am not clinically diagnosed. I know for a fact that I want to get better but I always fall back into the same place. It does feel impossible at this point and also I ruminate so much even about the smallest things. I'm tired from rumination and how these stuff affects my life. 

One day I feel I can conquer everything and change my entire mindset, the next moment/day I just feel the same old negative self is back.

Don't live with anger/hate in your heart, it will only cause you stress and tension, which I am afraid has likely been a partial reason for my current situation.

Try to forgive. Carrying around resentments only hurts you in the end. I carried around so much resentment towards those who hurt me. Meanwhile many of them went on to live normal lives because they frankly didn't care what they did to me, meanwhile I carried around so much tension because I kept rehashing painful memories in my head over and over.

Don't let depression run your life. Get help. Too many years I carried around suicidal thoughts without getting real help. I saw a couple doctors, was on antidepressants but I never did anything to solve the causation of my depression or get past it.

Hold on to those who love you. I pushed away many people who cared about me because they didn't know how to deal with my depression and anger.

2022-10-31 11:58:27,depression,"I don’t really use Reddit that often, but I really wanted to get this off my chest.
I’m 17, and I’ve had depression for a long time now. It got really bad when the pandemic started, and I spent almost two years doing absolutely nothing but play games and listen to music, cause that’s all that I felt like doing. I always got out of bed really late and didn’t really see a reason to do so. All that kept me alive was music, that I always listened to and cried to until like, 5am.
Anyways, things started to get better a year ago. I started dating, fell in complete love with this girl that I thought was perfect, I just can’t explain how much I loved her. We stayed together for 9 months, but throughout those nine months I started realizing that even though I loved her so much, it was hurting me a lot, and I hadn’t felt happy in a long time. She also struggled with depression, would cut herself, attempted suicide multiple times, and it all really made me feel really bad and panic because I couldn’t help, and didn’t know how to. I know it’s my fault for not knowing how to help her, but I tried very hard. I don’t blame her for making me sad this way, it was my own mistakes. Eventually, I broke up with her, but not because of her problems. I realized the relationship was really toxic, and I had no friends anymore, nor could I have female friends. There was also a lot of emotional “blackmail” (idk the word, not my main language). That happened 4 months ago, and made me get into another really dark period of my life.
I broke up with her still having strong feelings for her. Then, I tried to keep contact, so I could help her if she ever felt bad, but she had two other boyfriends in the periof of, idk, a month and a half, while saying she loved me. I just couldn’t handle it anymore and blocked her. I know I was really selfish, but I couldn’t do it anymore.
Now, I have my own band, I’m writing my own songs and stuff, as a kind of therapy. It makes me feel much better, and I have lots of fun when playing with my friends and bandmates, but every single time when I get home and I’m alone, it’s always the same.
Now she has a third boyfriend, who she seems really happy with. I tried to stop looking at her posts multiple times but I just can’t. I’m happy for her, she seems happy, and that’s all I need, but still a part of me wishes that could be me. 
And it’s not just because of her. I don’t think about her that much anymore, but every single night I feel horrible, sad, and alone, and every single morning all I want is to go to sleep again. I don’t to get up from bed, but I don’t want life to end either. I’ve always been strong against suicide, part because I have hope it’ll get better, part because I don’t have the guts to end it all. 
I just don’t see this getting better ever.
I still hope it will, and I’m not gonna kill myself, but it’d be so much easier if I did, if I couldn’t feel these feelings anymore, if I didn’t have to deal with everything.
Few things make me happy nowadays, but I don’t really have a reason to feel this way, you know? There are people that care about me, I have friends, I have things that I want, but even with every single reason in the world to be happy, i’m just not.
Is this ever gonna end? I take meds, I write and listen to music, I try to do everything to make this go away, but it just doesn’t.
I still stand strong, I’m not gonna let this thing beat me, but sometimes I really wish I had the courage to let it win.

Sorry for the long post, I really had to take it out of my chest. There’s no one I can talk to about these things in such deep manner.

&amp;#x200B;

So basically I (22F) recently lost my brother (28M) and moved back in with my parents to be closer to family since I was living on the other side of the country when this event happened. My younger brother (16M) is having a hard time coping with everything which is completely understandable, but he is dragging everybody else down with him and I can't do it anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

He is mean and snappy, literally if you say one wrong thing innocently it turns into him screaming and yelling about how much he hates you and wishes you were dead. He has also recently gotten violent and started sneaking alcohol into the house, and gets EXTREMELY violent when he is drunk, last time he punched me in the face, kicked me as hard as he could making me fall into the dresser and hurt my ankle, and also told me he was going to k\*ll me if I tried to take his alcohol away. I haven't slept a full night in nearly 6 months because he is always sending me sewersidal texts at night so I often lay awake at night listening to make sure I don't hear him harm himself/replying to texts to make sure he lives to see the morning. He IS getting help, going to three different counselors pretty much every day of the week, we are putting all our focus onto him and making sure he is staying alive but it's REALLY taking a toll on me and bringing me back to a really dark depression I just recently got out of after being extremely mentally ill my whole entire life.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do at this point. I can't stand being around this kid anymore, I love him to death but it's hurting me mentally so bad that I can't even help him anymore because I'm so emotionally fried and feel like most times I do more harm than good. I'm applying for out of state jobs again but not hearing anything back since my field is extremely competitive, I can't/don't want to move out of my parents house to get a place in my hometown since I plan on leaving soon and don't want to be stuck on a lease that I'll have to break, I have no friends with places of their own that would let me stay at their house for the time being etc... i'm at a loss. I'm really struggling again after FINALLY feeling the ""light"" in life for the first time and I really can't afford to get back into the place I was before because I'm not sure I can fight my way out this time.

i made the right call back then. i knew i would deteriorate into a clockwork husk if i didn't die when i should've. but then i had to continue, and everything had to get worse when i realized how incapable i am of the only things i want.

and i had to find that strange reflection. that person who's my age, can do all the things i've imagined doing, is disturbingly similar to me and my own ideas, is what i can only determine the version of me who didn't fail. i can't even consider the ideas my own anymore. i should've been like them.

well, even though that continues to cripple my spirit, earlier this year i tried to push past and get the ball rolling with drawing. and what a surprise, it went nowhere because i don't have the passion. i'm not capable of art in any regard.

this is it dude, i'm not cut out for any of it. i had my chances to grow into anything significant whatsoever and i blew them all. i could have been so much, and it torments me thinking of if i got to execute my ideas first. my free time is dwindling, and i'm melting into a useless drone. and even if by some freak turn of events i were to somehow gain the passion i lack and move forward with drawing, it would take years before it'd be anywhere worth witnessing. i don't know what to do, the only thing i can think of is just biting the bullet. life is just punishing me for my fuck up in 2016. i should've been dead already.

2022-10-30 14:57:51,depression,"So me and someone else I know (can't count as real friend) we both started programming seriously last year, I met that person in free programming bootcamp and we were both struggling to get a job back then after graduating from university. our knowledge in programming were kind of the same. we both learned a lot from that bootcamp which helped us later to get our first job.  


Later after working in our first jobs for like 2 months, we both got recommended for another better job. I was kind of ok with my current job even though I wasn't learning much from it but I took the new job interview just because I was thinking I might regret it not taking this interview. I went for the interview and failed in it because I don't have much knowledge and I was thinking of my current job because I don't want to leave it yet.  


So after like 2 months and a half I wasn't learning anything new from my current job because we are using old kind of technologies and I wanted to get new job now because I felt I have wasted like 4-5 months of my life, at the same time  I saw that person  on social media that he got accepted to the same job I have failed to get and he still has his old job as part time, I talked with him because i wanted to know what kind of technologies they use at that job and to my surprise they use technologies i really enjoy to use and not boring or old ones. At that time I felt jealous and depressed because I feel he is way better than me now and he is probably learning more now because he is at such a good company and I have wasted so much of my time and I can't reach his level anymore.  


Now I want to learn new technologies at my spare time so I can get better job but seeing everyone is getting better jobs on LinkedIn and acing everything makes me depressed that I can't reach there level anymore even how much I try to learn because I'm really slow at learning and I procrastinate a lot. I do want these people to achieve these goals and I'm happy for them but I also want to be good, learn new stuff, get money to help my parents and not fail again. but its just hard thinking about all the 5 months I have wasted and missed opportunity to get new good job.","Feeling depressed for not improving, wasting time and people near me are getting better jobs"

I had to leave my natural family at 16. From there I went for an education, friends,career. I got a decent education, I don’t have any friends, and I am without a career.

Since my failures in my career I’ve studied independently for a new career and it has not come to fruition because it’s a hard career to break into. 

I maybe could find a career outside of my main academic studies and side study. But I look around and have no family and friends. On my 31st birthday. I look around at nothing I have. Savings being burned through just to pay rent. And no one I find close to me. 

My lithium has done a lot to keep me from the edge. But at what point does one have to wonder if it’s all without hope. My expertise I can’t find gainful employment, my independent studies are so far off gainful employment, and no one will love me or be friends.

2022-10-30 14:55:08,depression,"Life hasn't been treating me well these last couple of months. Ever since I started college, everything has just been going downhill for me and I feel like I'm in a never-ending spiral of just pain and misery. 

To start things off, I ruined my relationship with my ex. He was my first love, my first experience, my first everything. We initially began dating during our junior year of highschool, but unfortunately due to issues regarding his mental health, we broke up after several months. Despite this, we remained friends and kept on good terms with one another. Even though we were broken up, it honestly felt like nothing changed. We still had the same dynamic, and our connection grew even stronger as time went on. 
Fast forward to senior year of highschool, and we both decided we wanted to try again and possibly reignite the relationship we once had. And it was going well, until we ran into some problems. We both had different ideals for what we wanted in our relationship. He wanted us to go public and tell everybody that we were dating, but on the other hand, I was afraid. I was scared that my friends, my family, etc. would judge us for getting back together. Because let's be honest, getting back together with your ex? Is that really a smart idea? At least that's what most people believe. I felt like the people in my life weren't going to support us, and that's what ultimately led us to where we are now. I messed up so much to the point where he doesn't want to see me, talk to me, etc. He's blocked me on Instagram, on FaceBook, and most of my other social media. He wants me out of his life. And to be honest, I don't blame him. I kept making empty promises to him, saying that we could be together again but that day never came. I made him wait for so long, that eventually he just grew tired and decided to move on. I was also being selfish and inconsiderate. I never really took into account how he felt, and usually made it seem like I was the victim. Like for example, whenever he would talk to another girl, or get close to another girl, I would be filled with jealousy. And I never realized till now that I made it seem like my feelings mattered more than his. And I feel awful for allowing that to happen. He placed my happiness before his own, and that really took a toll on him. Sometimes I would get so angry that he'd talk to other girls to the point where I'd vent on my Instagram stories and post stuff about him being ""toxic"" when in truth, my behavior was more toxic than anything I ever said about him. As a result, he cut off our friendship, blocked me/ unfriended me on most of my social media, and wants absolutely nothing to do with me anymore. Now he's talking to another girl and it just honestly breaks my heart to see how easily he's moved on. Meanwhile I'm still here struggling, still in the healing stage, still thinking about him from time to time. And I hate it, so much. Because he doesn't care anymore. He's moved on with his life and found someone new, so why do I still care? Why am I having such a hard time letting go? I want these feelings to go away so desperately so I can be at peace with myself and move on, but it's so hard. And I feel like I may never be able to completely move on from him.

My situation with my ex got so bad to the point where it even affected my friends/ friend group. They became disappointed in me, saying how I should have just told them about how I wanted to date my ex again, and that they would have supported me. They even said it was clear how we felt about each other. The fact we would cuddle, flirt, etc. around them made it super obvious. Being a good friend is listening to others and supporting their decisions. They can only offer so much advice, but in the end, it's up to us on what we choose to do with that advice. Because it's our life, and we shouldn't make decisions purely based on what others will think/ say. Unfortunately I failed to realize that, and I feel terrible. The fact that I didn't place enough trust in my ex bf, let alone my own friends, makes me feel like a bad person. My friends ended up cutting themselves off from me, saying how they want me to get better and improve myself, and so because of this, we ended up just disbanding the friend group. 

I have nobody to turn to anymore. No one to rely on. My friends want me to seek help, but I have to wait an entire month just to see a local therapist. I'm drowning in my own thoughts and I'm finding it harder and harder everyday to crawl out of this hole I've dug myself in. I just feel so alone, and the thought of being alone just shatters me because it's most likely a consequence of my actions. I hurt my first love, my friends, and even my family is starting to get concerned. They ask me everyday how I'm feeling but I always answer, ""I'm fine.""

I'm not fine. I'm not fine whatsoever.
I'm hurting, I'm in pain, and I don't know what else to do.
I feel like a horrible person. The things I've said and done have caused more harm than good. 

And I don't know how to heal, how to move on.

I hear voices and sounds now, I see things that aren’t there, I can’t sleep, I can’t eat. It’s been two years I still have these issues, ever since they started it’s felt like I’ve lost all physical and emotional feeling. When I get cut or hurt I feel it for seconds and it’s gone. When I hit out of a 1 year relationship I felt sad for an hour at most barely let out a tear. I’ve kept all this bottled up because it’s so hard to describe what actually happens to the point where someone can understand.

I can’t fully describe how I feel but the best is nothing, it’s the easiest way. Tonight is exceptionally bad and I work in a few hours I needed to let this out somewhere to someone, I tried to cry thinking it would help but I physically can not.

I had a close friend that was very emotionally abusive and for the past few years the only thing people wanted me for was their own personal wall to vent to. I feel so alone and scared.

I cover my mouth with my hand when i smile. Im called ugly, stupid. I feel ugly and stupid. I have no safe place to run away too, nobody i can trust. I have no aspirations, no drive. what am i supposed to do? Im doing great in school but whats it all for at this point. why am i wasting my time. It hurts so bad. I cant bear this pain, i hate it and myself for it. The only happiness i get is always taken from me so quickly over things as simple as being left on seen by a friend. People dont respect my space either. I say over and over that i dont like physical contact and then they pretend to kiss me because they think its funny. Its not. I wanna be alone forever but i know thats not going to make me happy. I just want to be happy, to be able to trust my parents not to turn on me. To have a close friend group that all support each other. No matter what everyone in person tends to leave, if they dont i wish they would because usually theyre not great people.

2022-10-30 14:23:34,depression,"I'm depressed. A major symptom of depression is being tired, and I find myself experiencing more tiredness than I used to, and although i'm tired, I don't sleep as often as it seems a depressed person should, if that's a thing.  When I sleep, I don't sleep well, for long, and when I wake up, i'm still as tired as shit. I do feel overwhelming urges to sleep throughout the day but I can't act on them. It seems like depressed people are supposed to put their heads on their pillows and immediately fall asleep. I may be tired, but I couldn't fall asleep like that. I'm tired, I do think much more than i've been in the past, but sleep doesn't come easy. It's not like i'm stressing about things, I don't think of a single thing that's stressing me before I go to bed, or in any case, because I find it too stressful, and I become slightly nauseated.

I (F29) really fucking miss you(M33). In the short time we spent together, I felt safe. You made me feel like the best version of me. Even when you did something I didn’t like I always wanted to forgive you. I’m not even someone who lets things go easily but for the sake of peace it was always you I wanted, especially in moments of adversity. You’ve taught me patience. The right to joy. It’s through you I believe in destiny. I truly adore you. 

You are my tranquility. 
I know I’m really stubborn but even when you prove me wrong about something I’m eternally thankful for the lesson. You make me see beyond myself. You’re existence alone makes the world a better place.

I knew I loved you the day I met you.
I knew I respected you the first time I spoke to you. Your voice is my siren. I feel compelled to answer to every whim of yours. I’m happy to do so even. I want to learn how to make every one of your favourite meals so your tastebuds always experience my love and dedication. I want to twist every loc on your head so that the crown that adorns your unique face is met with the best intentions. 

I breathe easier when I’m with you. My world doesn’t feel as heavy when you’re around. Colours are brighter, food tastes better, your scent hits me as if it’s in HD. I hate feeling like we’ve fallen out because we’re both too proud. My pride is not worth losing you. 

I just want to melt in your arms again. I hate touching people but that first hug we ever shared felt like home to me. I remember saying to myself, “I’ve arrived.” I’m truly enthralled by you. Fascinated. I’m so deeply in love with you. My family even welcomed you with open arms before I was sure about us but they only solidified my confidence in what I know is the best decision I’ve ever made. You. Every conclusion I’ve come to about you makes me more sure than before. You make me want to correct all of my terrible behaviour and bad habits. You are so worth the change. 

I choose you. I’d choose you everyday over and over again if I could. I believe this is just bump in our story. I won’t rush forever.

All my love. 
Forever and always.

2022-10-30 14:09:54,depression,"Note: I made a post in r/OCD and never get a response. 

Hi everyone, 
So I’m a 20M who suffers severe OCD. Lately, I have been thinking a lot about the past. I have been having serious nostalgia and have been obsessing about this for the past few weeks, mainly about how the world so much better like 20 plus years ago. I keep obsessing about how awesome it would’ve been to be a teen/young adult in the 90s. This is mainly due to decline in music quality, less technology (I.e. iPhones), more face-to-face interactions and being able to afford a house etc. But to be honest, thinking about my teen years, which ended in 2020, makes me sad. I thought that times were bad then but they really weren’t. The world was more normal before 2020. COVID has caused a lot of damage. The further that the years pre 2020 become, the more sad I become and can’t help thinking how long ago it was. Even the decade such as the 90s becoming further away, although I wasn’t alive then, makes me sad. It just seems that normality is becoming more distant as the years go by.

What tips can I use to overcome this problem? 

Thanks",Nostalgia obsessions/depression

2022-10-30 13:59:43,depression,I have been getting out of my comfort zone so much to try and make friends that I feel uncomfortable all the time. It’s exhausting to go to many places and try new activities in hopes of making a friend but to fail and feel that you’ve wasted your time. Too many (un)success stories that I could keep a crowd entertained by campfire overnight. I am tiring myself out. I should accept being alone already for the sake of not exhausting my mind and body. But I just haven’t accepted it yet. Feeling lonely depresses me but  not accepting my loneliness is even more depressing. I wish I could rid myself of these conflicting feelings.,25yo M and tired of being alone

——-


Ready to die 
Held my dog and said my goodbye 
God feel free to take me right now I’m not afraid to die 
Just really eager to die
I hate existence  
Just full of ups and downs with a whole lot of false ups
You climb the ladder of help but a step broke on you now your back to the bottom
Just a endless loop of hope and despair 
Hoping that my episodes of hopelessness will take me 
I don’t have energy to even write this
I wish I was fit 
I wish I was attractive 
I wish I was loved 
I wish I wasn’t so lonely 
So lonely 
It’s a dark place 
Pitch black 
The lights will flicker every once in a while 
But that’s just false hope again 
Giving up 
I really just want to give up 
I have no energy or hope to fight this 
I just want the lord to take me
Why won’t you take me god 
I asked you for purpose but you won’t give it to me 
That’s fine I don’t expect anything 
But don’t send me to hell if I take myself 
It’s just not fair god this is just how i feel 
I live to suffer but if I take my life I’ll suffer? 
Send me to hell for killing myself 
That’s not fair god I’m sorry 
There must be something I did to deserve this 
Please lord Jesus Christ I just want mercy 
Just erase my soul and put me to peace
Because to not exist means to not suffer 
I hate being here hoping for purpose and love just for that dream to crash down
Something is wrong here god there’s a lot of sadness for no reason 
People are tortured by their minds for no reason 
Give us an out god please and don’t punish us for it
Forgive us for taking this life you give us but understand this life doesn’t feel like a gift it feels like a curse
A sentence for torture 
That I cannot escape 
If I do I have to fear the demons grabbing my soul 
God I pledged my loyalty no matter how distant we are I am still loyal. I hate you and love you at the same time 
Because I don’t understand god 
I will never understand while I’m alive 
Depending on my brain for happiness that will never arise. 

I just want love and purpose
You built us to live for those two things 
But it’s a distant hope because my suffering won’t let me find my queen 
My energy is out for now 
I will just go to sleep and hope for death 
That will help me rest 
And wake up tommorrow for the new day 
But every day just adds to the cycle 
Of lost hope and dreams 

My name is —————- and my life doesn’t matter. I’m here for fuck no reason. I don’t even have it that bad in life if I think about it. Which makes is so frustrating on why am I so fucking sad all the time. Why do I want to die so bad? I don’t know these are just the cards I was dealt. I’d like to imagine I’m different and I’ll be saved from this torture and live a happy life. But the truth is people die very sad endings. And I think my life will have one too. I don’t know if I will share these journal entries or not. But this is just an insight of what’s going on in my mind.

In turn, they've begun listening. Suddenly I find myself able to open up to them without any major push-back. My dad has been helping me fix up my car. My mom is helping me with my depression and anxiety. Together, we've even come across some helpful ways to deal with my ADHD without medication.

It has been difficult adjusting after returning home from working far north for 3 months. I am a parasite on my family and rely on them for transportation and shelter, occasionally pitching in for groceries. My mother routinely shames me for not going out to parties and socializing. She has told me that I am a burden to her, which I understand. I have no desire or energy to get out and party with others my age, I am so tired I just want to die. Nothing is fun anymore. I feel trapped in my own comfort zone and cannot work up the courage or the desire to leave it. 

My mother has discouraged me from seeking an apartment elsewhere to save money, whilest shaming me for remaining in her basement.

2022-10-30 12:11:56,depression,"I never write anything on reddit or elsewhere on the web and don't browse much, but can't sleep and decided to type my thoughts here.

My 29th birthday is coming up tomorrow and am reflecting back on my life.

Somewhere around 17-19 I noticed that I started to care less and less. Just did the bare minimum in life to get past stuff. Started working in a boring, shit paying job at 18 and stuck there since. Almost never had any ambitions or goals in life except one. Was just looking to get past somehow. I feel like a balloon, loosing air over time. While other people got stuff done I was doing just the bare minimum. Too comfortable to leave my job even though it sucks a lot and have to numb myself mentally to endure. Coworkers are mostly all older than me and the job is very physical, leaving me tired after work to do much else. Nowadays the days pass like on autopilot. Why nothing matters to me is unknown to me. I am unable to understand how people get hyped or inspired by things or have passion for something.

The only thing I was trying to achieve was getting financially independent by having a one person online business with automated systems. My ""motivation"" wasn't becoming rich or living a luxurious lifestyle, but having something for myself to sustain me, not having to deal much with people and get more time after the business is doing well. Making money and sustaining myself through a business plays the biggest role for me as that is how I believe I could turn my life over.

The business failed when I was 23 and after trying to put in more energy than I had to build another one I burned out. I have serious doubt in achieving the only thing I may have cared about. 

 I am currently trying to build up another business after couple years and learning from my mistakes. I just have to constantly battle with myself, to work in my free time on my business and dealing with procrastination, negative thoughts, and constantly thinking about making money. Deep down I know that I don't really have a passion for it, but do it because I have to make money. And it takes a lot of time to advance for me in this regard.

Looking back I mostly avoided more and more having to do anything with people as I grew older as they drain me of my energy fast. I think that most people are very emotional and I hate putting energy into socializing with people I don't really care about, like coworkers, but have to make due. I always wonder how people deal with that. I also don't like opening up about myself and can't show vulnerability. I have a hard time to live in the moment.

Was only 2 times in another country as a kid, but since then stayed only in my city. Most people talk about traveling positively, but when I just think about it I couldn't care less.

Family members are disappointed in me and I don't have a good connection to anyone. The worst part in all of this is that feeling of being very disappointed in yourself and unable to get out of that loop of battling with yourself, procrastination and depression. Feeling really tired.

Really don't want to take any meds to numb myself or visit professional help at all.

I am coming to realize now that  I don't have much to live for. 

I clearly do not handle breakups well. On paper my life should be fulfilling, I have a safe job where I do well, I am physically healthy, I have no debts, I have savings, and a supportive family. I have all this and I just feel hollow. When I've had goals I feel better about having something else to focus on. As I've chipped away at accomplishing many I don't feel better anymore; in fact, I just feel worse. Plenty of goals exist but I don't feel the drive to accomplish them anymore. Less energy and more questions on what is the point. 

My ex and I are still talking and she is deciding to work on herself which given our history I am glad she is doing. I'm not certain what we are even doing at this rate in talking to each other.

\-' she just wants you to be a friend, to show you she can move on from you

i made the right call back then. i knew i would deteriorate into a clockwork husk if i didn't die when i should've. but then i had to continue, and everything had to get worse when i realized how incapable i am of the only things i want.

and i had to find that strange reflection. that person who's my age, can do all the things i've imagined doing, is disturbingly similar to me and my own ideas, is what i can only determine the version of me who didn't fail. i can't even consider the ideas my own anymore. i should've been like them.

well, even though that continues to cripple my spirit, earlier this year i tried to push past and get the ball rolling with drawing. and what a surprise, it went nowhere because i don't have the passion. i'm not capable of art in any regard.

this is it dude, i'm not cut out for any of it. i had my chances to grow into anything significant whatsoever and i blew them all. i could have been so much, and it torments me thinking of if i got to execute my ideas first. my free time is dwindling, and i'm melting into a useless drone. and even if by some freak turn of events i were to somehow gain the passion i lack and move forward with drawing, it would take years before it'd be anywhere worth witnessing. i don't know what to do, the only thing i can think of is just biting the bullet. life is just punishing me for my fuck up in 2016. i should've been dead already.

I am writing this at 3 am. I haven't slept more than 3 hours a day for the last week but somehow I still manage to get up every morning and drag myself to Uni. I feel exhausted and would love to sleep. I feel totally stressed out but still somehow manage to more or less keep up a facade every day. I recently moved to NYC for one semester.

Simply replying to messages makes me feel stressed out all day and I procrastinate answering until I go to bed. Then, I take like an hour or so to simply send a reply because I overthink every little detail and possibility. I drink more than I'd like to but even that does not make me wanna go to sleep. I feel embarrassed each time that my roommate or friends tell me how I just fell asleep somewhere in the flat out of pure exhaustion and also drunkness which just makes things worse. I feel embarrassed about how much I drink, just to escape my overwhelming exhausting headspace. I just laid on the kitchen floor for almost an hour, staring at the table and wall from below because I felt comfortable there. I keep telling my family and friends how great I feel because I kind of feel guilty for having this opportunity that I am unable to fully live out and experience.

2022-10-29 14:49:22,depression,"I don't really know where to start to be honest. 

Probably the most cliche opener, but I think it gets the point across pretty reliably. I struggled with depression from late 2016 till around mid 2019, and it always sat there, always lingered, in the back of my mind, as depression does for most others. 

My life has been going pretty great since then, I experienced a lot of things and learnt a lot, not only about myself, but about the people, and world at large, around me. It was pretty great.

But lately, things haven't felt the same. Ever day is just filled with an unshakeable sense of monotony, and the usual effort to go out isn't helping anymore. I used to be able to go out and shake the feeling, I'd go eat dinner by myself or just go visit some new place. Now, though, things feel different. 

Maybe it's just bad timing.

I just finished school and it's currently exam period, but I know myself well enough to know that exams aren't the reason all this is happening. All the same, though, I have this unshakeable feeling that there is nothing to do anymore. My usual city trips yield nothing new, and I wind up just wishing I'd stayed home and saved my time and money. 

Now that school's over, I can do whatever I wish. People around me are going to parties, drinking, and just generally having a good time. That stuff all feels empty to me, though, somewhat void of any actual pleasure. 

I want to clarify first that I have not done anything bad, but it's just an honest run down. 

I was sitting here, before my desk as usual, browsing the internet and trying to find interesting things to investigate further, and I just realised nothing felt the same anymore. The games I used to play are boring, new games are even worse, and even my friend group just feels like a helpless repetition of itself daily. And that's when I thought about drinking, or doing something to try and change the way I perceive the world, but obviously I didn't because alcohol reliance is something I'm actually worried about given just how shitty I feel. I thought about drugs, drinking, all the generic sort of stuff. Nothing else really creates anything in me; no emotional response.

I haven't gone through with any of it, nor do I plan on doing so. But the thought crossed my mind for the first time in my life.

I'm not sure what to do. It feels like my best friend is making stronger ties with other people and is overall exposing themselves to more things, and they just don't have as much time anymore for us to talk about things. And I'm happy for them, they deserve the world because they are an amazing person in their own right, but unfortunately that means I am without someone I can reliably talk to.

Another issue I have is I think that depression and this sort of stuff is innately esoteric in nature, so it's kind of hard to ""reach out"" with a realistic expectation that someone will understand perfectly and reach some sort of conclusion.

I've never done one of these before. But I want help from people who are probably experiencing similar things, because I know that that sort of thing can be a difference maker.

Do you have any suggestions?

Thanks.",Just a random rant

When I’m depressed I suffer from hypersomnia and sometimes will just roll over and go back to bed without ever getting out of it. I wish I could remember where but it read that if you struggle with this keep a big pack of water (or at least a few bottles) by/under your bed. When you’re this depressed, fuck aesthetics, it’s probably gonna feel like too much to go to the kitchen and get it too. Get it ordered from Amazon if you need to, then you only need to manage to get it from the door to your bed.

Anyway the way it works is just make sure you drink a bottle of water or two before bed. When you’re neglecting yourself and you’re dehydrated it’s easy to stay in bed because your bladder doesn’t get super full. But if you’re well hydrated and you drank a lot of water before bed you’ll probably need to get up and pee instead of rolling over and going back to sleep.

Not sure if it will help anyone else but it was an easy tip for me. Still getting there but it was better than nothing",random tip that helped me: staying hydrated can help you break the cycle of sleeping 10-12 hours.

I went by this ideology for years, and I was successful in making my family for the next many generations not have to worry about anything financially. Despite having completed my sense of duty as a man I feel empty. I feel so guilty for being unsatisfied with my life. I was flying out of NYC to see my family the other day and I had a weird sense of pointlessness in my actions up to this point in my life. I feel like I've wasted my life away in pursuit of wealth. I was consumed by my greed. I feel like I'm watching my life in front of me on a movie screen. This sense of indifference to everything feels so wrong. One of my friends that I've kept close over the years recommended I talk to a medical professional and try medication. The medication makes me feel like reality is slipping away from me even faster. Does anyone know how to cope with this sense of my own reality slipping away?  Honestly, the numbness isn't what worries me the most.

These past 3 years have been so traumatizing. I fell in love with a narcissist. I was/am deeply involved in his cycle. He cheats, lies, degrades, discards. 

When he's with me he is ALL in. I'm talking about everyday he's with me. Inseparable.  We laugh, have deep convos, go out etc. It's great.  But then I start picking up on signs that point to things that he's done before . He hates it.  He doesn't want to be called out. 

I find out what hurtful shit he's done this time and now all of a sudden I am crazy.  He tells these women lies about me. He even says awful things to me. 

And I  go into a dark place. Like the worst, scariest depression I've ever experienced.  He ignores me. Like completely. And it hurts. I'm starting to honestly feel like there's something deeply wrong with me.  I  feel like maybe he's right. And the fact that he ignores me adds to my pain.

2022-10-29 13:18:13,depression,"i'll be **posting** from time to time, so let's start with **Fear**, and later with more **Stopping Suicide** related issues!!!.

\~ ***The Urantia Book*** (which is divine revelation (1955) free online to download etc and already in the public domain):

excerpt just below about **Overcoming Fear**...

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**6. The Young Man Who Was Afraid**  
&gt;  
&gt;130:6.1 (1437.1) While they were up in the mountains, Jesus had a long talk with a young man who was fearful and downcast. Failing to derive comfort and courage from association with his fellows, this youth had sought the solitude of the hills; he had grown up with a feeling of helplessness and inferiority. These natural tendencies had been augmented by numerous difficult circumstances which the lad had encountered as he grew up, notably, the loss of his father when he was twelve years of age. As they met, Jesus said: “Greetings, my friend! why so downcast on such a beautiful day? If something has happened to distress you, perhaps I can in some manner assist you. At any rate it affords me real pleasure to proffer my services.”  
&gt;  
&gt;130:6.2 (1437.2) The young man was disinclined to talk, and so Jesus made a second approach to his soul, saying: “I understand you come up in these hills to get away from folks; so, of course, you do not want to talk with me, but I would like to know whether you are familiar with these hills; do you know the direction of the trails? and, perchance, could you inform me as to the best route to Phenix?” Now this youth was very familiar with these mountains, and he really became much interested in telling Jesus the way to Phenix, so much so that he marked out all the trails on the ground and fully explained every detail. But he was startled and made curious when Jesus, after saying good-bye and making as if he were taking leave, suddenly turned to him, saying: “I well know you wish to be left alone with your disconsolation; but it would be neither kind nor fair for me to receive such generous help from you as to how best to find my way to Phenix and then unthinkingly to go away from you without making the least effort to answer your appealing request for help and guidance regarding the best route to the goal of destiny which you seek in your heart while you tarry here on the mountainside. As you so well know the trails to Phenix, having traversed them many times, so do I well know the way to the city of your disappointed hopes and thwarted ambitions. And since you have asked me for help, I will not disappoint you.” The youth was almost overcome, but he managed to stammer out, “But—I did not ask you for anything—” And Jesus, laying a gentle hand on his shoulder, said: “No, son, not with words but with longing looks did you appeal to my heart. My boy, to one who loves his fellows there is an eloquent appeal for help in your countenance of discouragement and despair. Sit down with me while I tell you of the service trails and happiness highways which lead from the sorrows of self to the joys of loving activities in the brotherhood of men and in the service of the God of heaven.”  
&gt;  
&gt;130:6.3 (1437.3) By this time the young man very much desired to talk with Jesus, and he knelt at his feet imploring Jesus to help him, to show him the way of escape from his world of personal sorrow and defeat. Said Jesus: “My friend, arise! Stand up like a man! You may be surrounded with small enemies and be retarded by many obstacles, but the big things and the real things of this world and the universe are on your side. The sun rises every morning to salute you just as it does the most powerful and prosperous man on earth. Look—you have a strong body and powerful muscles—your physical equipment is better than the average. Of course, it is just about useless while you sit out here on the mountainside and grieve over your misfortunes, real and fancied. But you could do great things with your body if you would hasten off to where great things are waiting to be done. You are trying to run away from your unhappy self, but it cannot be done. You and your problems of living are real; you cannot escape them as long as you live. But look again, your mind is clear and capable. Your strong body has an intelligent mind to direct it. Set your mind at work to solve its problems; teach your intellect to work for you; refuse longer to be dominated by fear like an unthinking animal. Your mind should be your courageous ally in the solution of your life problems rather than your being, as you have been, its abject fear-slave and the bond servant of depression and defeat. But most valuable of all, your potential of real achievement is the spirit which lives within you, and which will stimulate and inspire your mind to control itself and activate the body if you will release it from the fetters of fear and thus enable your spiritual nature to begin your deliverance from the evils of inaction by the power-presence of living faith. And then, forthwith, will this faith vanquish fear of men by the compelling presence of that new and all-dominating love of your fellows which will so soon fill your soul to overflowing because of the consciousness which has been born in your heart that you are a child of God.  
&gt;  
&gt;130:6.4 (1438.1) “This day, my son, you are to be reborn, re-established as a man of faith, courage, and devoted service to man, for God’s sake. And when you become so readjusted to life within yourself, you become likewise readjusted to the universe; you have been born again—born of the spirit—and henceforth will your whole life become one of victorious accomplishment. Trouble will invigorate you; disappointment will spur you on; difficulties will challenge you; and obstacles will stimulate you. Arise, young man! Say farewell to the life of cringing fear and fleeing cowardice. Hasten back to duty and live your life in the flesh as a son of God, a mortal dedicated to the ennobling service of man on earth and destined to the superb and eternal service of God in eternity.”  
&gt;  
&gt;130:6.5 (1438.2) And this youth, Fortune, subsequently became the leader of the Christians in Crete and the close associate of Titus in his labors for the uplift of the Cretan believers.  
&gt;  
&gt;130:6.6 (1438.3) The travelers were truly rested and refreshed when they made ready about noon one day to sail for Carthage in northern Africa, stopping for two days at Cyrene. It was here that Jesus and Ganid gave first aid to a lad named Rufus, who had been injured by the breakdown of a loaded oxcart. They carried him home to his mother, and his father, Simon, little dreamed that the man whose cross he subsequently bore by orders of a Roman soldier was the stranger who once befriended his son.",Okay THE REAL DEAL about STOPPING DEPRESSION Forevermore and REALISTICALLY (!!!)

I’m building relationships, talking to people, acting friendly, but I always feel like a secondary option to those people. They have other friends that they speak to and see more often. I am a teacher, and had no teacher friends at my last school. I’m the only new teacher at my new school.

At the beginning of the school year, I was thrilled to see so many of my new coworkers being friendly with each other and catching up from the summer. I was excited to have that. I have gone out to bars outside of school time with groups of them, but I always feel excluded. I can’t contribute to their conversations. I can’t get a word in edgewise. I’m the 10th wheel.

Essentially, I feel unwanted and undesirable and it’s making me upset. I’ve realized that I have no reliable support system aside from my therapist. I am a burden to the 3-4 friends I do have, and if I bothered with telling them how sad I was, I would make them sad too. I don’t want to give anyone a reason to talk to me less.

I reached out after huge row with my boyfriend of 5 years..only to find out a few weeks after that, that fir the entire 5 years he was lyinh cheating community dick on dating sites saying single and had 2 kids behind my back, whilst me and him had decided we did not want more kids as had older teens/grown up kids and nental health so I had got sterilised 6 months in. I AM TOTALLY relieved I have not had his children but the entire deception hurts like hell. I am NOT in a good place due to that AND on top of it have the moods, bipola, depression
I am on autistic spectrum and I have PTSD. My entire life has been a shit show. Lots of abuse. Groomed as a young teen, trafficked, sold, abused, and spent years in jail. I have PTSD, bad relationships, this latest I am.now DONE. GLAD TO BE ALONE BUT SO SAD TO VE ALONE because when i met him I thought he was my dream come true and that I was finally going to have a real life and build and grow together and get our own place and be happy in our 40s and beyond with no kids and just each other 
It ALL sucks


I cant sleep but no motivation to do anything... i have to try clean by 9am.. its almost 5am.. the landlady and her husband are coming.. its messy here

I flipped other day just had big meltdown.. fed up with EVERYTHING and was crying non stop and called housing inspector out and landlady. I told her evict me so i can leave here and get social housing of my own somehow. I cant cope. The apartment is falling to bits. The bathroom is falling to bits. I am overwhelmed. I cant cope. I NEVER expected I would still be living here at all!! For so long now! Almost 10 years! I thought I wpuld have been left, living and narried to my ex in our OWN house or apartment in a 2 income household as part of a couple.. not alone still renting a shit hole.
And finding out the truth about my 'relationship'.

And landlady she does NO REPAIRS OR MAINTENANCE but i pay £600 a month rent. Over the years I got so fed up, I have spent thousands fixing and devorating and it all falls to shit, no one would ever know..

Inspector came. He said entire bathroom needs ripping out and replacing, 2 internal walls needs knocking down and replacing and damp proofing, and flooring needs replacing... plus other work like leaking sink ect..

Now landlady coming 9am. But i not been tidying as i should. I laid here all night. Almost 3 month now i sleep on sofa and cant go in my bedroom. I cant find the energy to clean but shes coming 9am. Then i have work and on shift with a new girl i dont want to work with at all. Wednesday was drama becausw I was very vocal about not wanting to work with new girl because she doesn't bloody do anything and I had to do all the cleaning and stuff last shift I was on with her and I told boss tell her what her jobs are please...And another girl took offence because its her friend...I was hyper anyway then my mood was crashing already then it crashed on way home I was sobbing in another workmates car. They just insensitive saying I need to stop feeling sorry for myself. 

I am Just totally fed up and nervous what landlady will say when she gets here and also finds out we have a cat too. I never asked. He is my mental health cat. I love him. He is always there purring and sitting with me. 

I know I will be exhauasted at work later. I start at 3pm.. 

I need psychiatrist referral. I need meds to control my moods. I need someone to help me get this apartment sorted out. 21 year old daughter turned up 4am one night left a room piled up with boxes of her stuff whilst shes flew off to have a year in South Korea, but I got stuck now with all these bloody boxes I don't want taking up space, it looks right mess.

I let the depression get to me. I got complacent. I stop cleaning Up, gained weight, and became a hermit since I work from home and just stopped caring about going out. 

Now after 7 years, the last 6 months have left her not wanting to be with me because of it all. I don't blame her. I wouldn't wanna be with me either. 

With rent prices the way they are, I could never afford anything on my own. Only other option is to go back to my mom's which just means I failed this whole adult thing.

Then my gf of 4yrs just broke up with me 2 months ago, and I feel like I'm just spiraling. She helped me through so much, including the death of my mom, only to leave me later the same year. I moved out of the apartment we had lived at for 3yrs to stay with some friends who have an extra room.I also had to leave behind our two cats that I only get to see every so often now, and missing them just sucks. I think the worst currently is just seeing her live her life and be so happy already without me, while I'm still struggling to get outta bed everyday.

2022-10-29 11:17:49,depression,"I'm fairly confident that nothing will change for the better from here on out, whatever ""changes"" that do happen are only ever for the worse now.

Can't help but feel it would be an awful idea to see a therapist. I can already guess what they would do in my situation. They'd try working me around it. Trying to get me to just live with it, to cope with it. They can't undo the art pains I have.

For about two and a half years now, this same thing has haunted me. And as much as I love talking about it, I'll admit it for once that this is merely the straw that broke the camel's back. I already tried shooting myself in 2016. And I failed.

It's the single biggest regret of my entire life. I could've been nonexistent by now. I wouldn't have had to experience an ounce of the envy. I wouldn't have had to find a version of myself who didn't fail in every aspect. I wouldn't have had to witness my ideas and desires already executed and perfected. I wouldn't have had to end up slamming my head into walls out of the frustration, the anguish, and the emptiness it all brought onto me from then on.

I have no passion, and I can't force it either. So I can't enjoy the process. So I won't just do it, and I won't go anywhere.

It's like the universe is looking me dead in the eyes, and asking. ""Why haven't you necked yourself yet?""

Because I'm scared. It's because I'm scared. No amount of being pissed off and resentful of the universe for existing will make me feel even slightly comfortable or entitled to something that isn't just more bullshit waiting patiently on the other side.

Even if I somehow pushed through this passion barrier of mine, it'd be years of work before any of it looked tolerable. My ideas can't even be considered my own anymore. And awful free-time lacking adult life is kicking in, in a world that already provoked a suicide attempt out of me before any of this art crap, way back when I was just 14.

And I'm really tired of trying to bring this up to friends or family, because I'm only bothering them. They have real problems to deal with. Complaining to them and crying about my life and problems that are nowhere near as bad as theirs only serves to stress them out more and waste their time. I exist to waste the time of others it seems.

I'll say it yet again. Everything I should've been is already out there. And I'm not exactly puncturing a hole in the art spectrum with my death, or just lack of contribution.

I'll never write anything worth reading. I'll never compose anything worth listening. I'll never draw anything worth witnessing. I'll never do anything worth acknowledging.

And yeah, I'll *never* do these things for sure if I'm dead. And if I'm gonna die anyways, why not try? So I tried.

I tried once, it felt awful. Soul-draining, tiring. I ended up going nowhere, and haven't touched drawing for 8 months now.

Then I tried again, something else. Doesn't work, my circumstances forbid it. Probably wouldn't have gone anywhere anyways.

And then I tried again, something else.

And what did the few who see it think of it? That it was boring, and dime a dozen. And I couldn't agree with them more, because that's just what happens when I try to do anything. Not like it would've gone anywhere in the end, it depended on me being capable of art, but I'm just a complete failure.

Nothing interests me anymore.

My only dreams are perpetual infeasibilities.

The days of having free time and getting enough sleep to make waking up worth it are long gone.

I wish my dad loved my mom.

I don't want to die. I don't want to do anything anymore. I really just wish I never had to exist in the first place.",I've come to the conclusion my dumb yet crippling problems are unfixable. Continuing life isn't an option.

2022-10-29 11:15:14,depression, I really want to die right now. My girlfriend hasn’t texted me all day. I know this sounds clingy and stuff but today she’s like ignored me or seemed annoyed with me and she’s at the local fair rn. Probably on the ride with some dude at work having the time of her life while I’m at home thinking about her. It makes me sick to my stomach. I mean she might not be but there’s always that possibility that she could be. I tend to do this when I overthink. I take my happiness and I make it seem like it’s just a fallacy or look at ever single way it could go wrong.  I mean she can go to the fair by herself or with a friend and I don’t want to sound controlling but I just wish she would talk to me some or like at least send a quick  text like “hey I’m going to the fair for an hour or so” but I don’t get anything and that causes me to overthink. I may be being unreasonable but like idk. And plus this morning our school is going through this “Gas app” phase and she showed me a boy saying “I wish they would take me out of the friend zone” to me and got upset when I gave her a dry response. I looked back at it half a hour later in my head and I realized (I more convinced myself I was being unreasonable) that she was pointing out they were in the friend zone. Idk I feel like this girl is the only think keeping me alive rn and I think she’s slipping away.,Am I being unreasonable?

2022-10-28 16:24:14,depression,"Hello to who ever might find this post, this will be my first and possibly last post on reddit.

To start this off - I'm depressed and I can't remember a time I ever wasn't and I just feel like writing some of my story out to free myself a little. So thanks to who ever makes it to the end. I'll try to make it short. 

So I can't remember much before the age of 8 but that was already where the bullying started and I had Noone to really turn to. My parents were for the most part not existent as emotional support because they were busy at all times. So this is where I already started to skip school and avoid people as much as possible. 
Changing school in 5th grade didn't really change much, I went to a school with lots of anti social kids that basically went looking for people to bother, so as one might expect I got picked out again and got bullied there too and really stopped going there as much as possible. In return the stress at home started, my parents tried to make me go by bringing me which ended up with me leaving school early or going in and immediately out again. I avoided going there by going out of the house and sitting somewhere on a staircase outside in the rain and all for 8 hours a day just to not have to be there. Eventually my parents found out and stress at home got worse. There was screaming violence to a small degree I'd say and I really just locked myself in my room all day crying. My parents at their wits end got help from some youth welfare office and they made me sign a lot of shit such as I am responsible for myself and made me go to like 15 different organizations and therapists who couldn't help me. 
So with all this happening I began playing with the thought of killing myself since I dropped out of school and there was just no hope in any direction I was looking. Like don't get me wrong my parents still to this day take care of me they just didn't know any better in the past. I have all my needs covered and always had except any kind of emotional support really. 
So all of this stretched till I was 16 when I dropped out. That was also the time I met my first boyfriend who was 2 years older than me and a soldier in training at the time. We only saw each other every two weeks and the beginning seemed really nice and I had the feeling I could be open about my feelings and thoughts and finally had someone to listen to me and show interest or so I thought. Turns out it's really hard to listen to my bullshit since I am very emotional and cry a lot, I just can't help it. After a year and a half he finally had enough, cheated on me still fucked me the day after, told me two days after my birthday after he took me to his place and broke up with me. In the end he told me how hard it was to deal with me, all I did wrong and yea that really broke me to this day. I asked him in the relationship to tell me when I need to work on stuff or if something is bothering him - he never said a word, only when it was too late to change and I really would have loved to change and work on things if I just knew what exactly. My experience with people is limited since I avoided people all my life really, playing games online and only there interacting with people. I just wish I was told more directly what's expected of me. 
After all this was done I was broken pretty much but I got a job at the place my dad worked where I tried to the best of my abilities but in the end my anxiety and panic attacks got the better of me and I quit. And from there on things spiraled again. 
Three years after that I had the luck of getting with my current boyfriend who is just so loving and he is really trying to take care of me and accepts my cry baby ass but I just can't help but being unable to 100%trust in things he says and I catch myself looking for a reason to run away from it because I am just too scared to get hurt again like this. I wish I could be worthy to be his girlfriend but I am really just waiting for the world to collapse on me once again and getting that last reason to end it.

I struggle with motivation to do anything, I don’t really have any hobbies anymore, I don’t go to half my lectures, I’m bored by everything, I don’t want to go out, I don’t want to meet new people, I feel inferior on my course and the slightest inconvenience or change of plan sends me into a vicious cycle of feeling so horribly sad and angry. I have brief moments of happiness but it fades and I go right back to feeling hardly anything at all. I hate myself for sabotaging my degree because I have work due and I don’t know what I’m even meant to be writing about. I think about the future and if i’ll ever achieve anything and it just makes me think about killing myself. I know I could never do it because i don’t have it in me but it’s eating away at me and making me lose my passion for everything I did. It’s really affecting my friendships and relationship with my boyfriend because he has been trying for so long to snap me out of it but nothing has happened. I had a couple of well-being seminars but they didn’t help and I don’t even have the motivation to call up again to ask for therapy.

2022-10-28 15:00:48,depression,"I broke down in front of my best friend and one of our close friends. I was extremely visibly upset and tried to leave the room to calm down in the bathroom. For context I've been dealing with untreated major depression and cptsd for years and am just starting to get medical attention. I have also been struggling with self harm. My best friend has also experienced mental health issues and we usually help each other through some tough times when we can. Since I am just getting help my symptoms are exceptionally bad right now. My best friend understandably stopped me from leaving as they were afraid I would go hurt myself. Our other friend comforted me and I was okay after 15 minutes. After this we went on a walk to get some fresh air. A few days later my best friend came to me and told me they could not drop everything for me when I was upset and that they wanted me to at least try to stop self harming. It made me feel extremely guilty for my emotions which is something that I have been trying to work on and I don't want this situation to ruin that progress. While I completely understand not having the mental capacity to be the stable person for someone, I have never expected this from any of my friends. I always clarify with them if they are able to make time and have the emotional capacity and expect them to be honest. I do not think that my best friend had any bad intentions but rather were unable to put themselves before me in that moment which led to emotional exaustion for them. At the same time I cannot help but feel hurt that they would put the responsibility of that on me when I never asked them to drop anything for me and instead tried to leave as to not push my emotions onto my friends. I am simply in a place emotionally where I can't have this person feel responsible for my emotions and then get upset at me for them. How do I communicate this to them without upsetting them?

2022-10-28 14:40:21,depression,"Things haven't been going the best for me, or maybe they really have when I look at the bigger picture. I've learned to stop letting other people define what feels like the every single movement to my life. 

The #1 thing I've learned in life recently so far is that: there are so many people that are choosing illegal drugs over everything in their life. They would rather be high than actually form meaningful connections with people, friends, and family. It is what it is, I've 100% been in that boat, but I saw what it did to my life, and how negatively it impacted everything for me. As soon as someone mentions to me that they do illegal drugs, it's just this giant warning bell in my brain that they aren't ready to choose someone else, they don't respect themselves, and they are at the stage in life where the only thing they can truly think about is the next time they can get high. 

I'm definitely not trying to sound preachy because like I said, I've been there before where I thought doing drugs was gonna fix all my problems, but at some point I learned to stop doing it to myself. 

This message is for anyone that's doubting themselves around people they want so badly to be in their life in a meaningful way, yet continue to go down that path of getting high right in front of you. It's not you, you're not the one that is crazy, and the sooner you can shift those people from your life, I promise there's a candle of light to hold onto. ❤","A positive, light story."

2022-10-28 14:16:33,depression,"Feels like a guarantee that nothing will change for the better from here on out, and the only ""changes"" that happen are forever for the worse.

And I'm really tired of trying to bring this up to friends or family, because I'm only bothering them. They have real problems to deal with. Complaining to them and crying about my life and problems that are nowhere near as bad as theirs only serves to stress them out more and waste their time.

I feel like it would be a bad idea to see a therapist. I can already guess what they would do in my situation. They'd try working me around it. Trying to get me to just live with it, to cope with it. They can't undo the art pains I have.

For about two and a half years now, this same thing has haunted me. And as much as I love talking about it, I'll admit it for once that this is merely the straw that broke the camel's back. I already tried shooting myself in 2016. And I failed.

It's the single biggest regret of my entire life. I could've been nonexistent by now. I wouldn't have had to experience an ounce of the envy. I wouldn't have had to find a version of myself who didn't fail in every aspect. I wouldn't have had to witness my ideas and desires already executed and perfected. I wouldn't have had to end up slamming my head into walls out of the frustration, the anguish, and the emptiness it all brought onto me from then on.

I have no passion, and I can't force it either. So I can't enjoy the process. So I won't just do it, and I won't go anywhere.

It's like the universe is looking me dead in the eyes, and asking. ""Why haven't you necked yourself yet?""

Because I'm scared. It's because I'm scared. No amount of being pissed off and resentful of the universe for existing will make me feel even slightly comfortable or entitled to something that isn't just more bullshit waiting patiently on the other side.

Even if I somehow pushed through this passion barrier of mine, it'd be years of work before any of it looked tolerable. My ideas can't even be considered my own anymore. And awful free-time lacking adult life is kicking in, in a world that already provoked a suicide attempt out of me before any of this art crap, way back when I was just 14.

I'll say it yet again. Everything I should've been is already out there. And I'm not exactly puncturing a hole in the art spectrum with my death, or just lack of contribution.

I'll never write anything worth reading. I'll never compose anything worth listening. I'll never draw anything worth witnessing. I'll never do anything worth acknowledging.

And yeah, I'll *never* do these things for sure if I'm dead. And if I'm gonna die anyways, why not try? So I tried.

I tried once, it felt awful. Soul-draining, tiring. I ended up going nowhere, and haven't touched drawing for 8 months now.

Then I tried again, something else. Doesn't work, my circumstances forbid it. Probably wouldn't have gone anywhere anyways.

And then I tried again, something else.

&amp;#x200B;

""dime-a-dozen""

""boring""

&amp;#x200B;

And I couldn't agree with them more, because that's just what happens when I try to do anything. Not like it would've gone anywhere in the end, it depended on me being capable of art, but I'm just a complete failure.

Everything sucks. I hate it all. Nothing interests me anymore.

My only dreams are perpetual infeasibilities.

The days of having free time and getting enough sleep to make waking up worth it are long gone.

I wish my dad loved my mom.

I don't want to die. I don't want to do anything anymore.

2022-10-28 13:44:54,depression," I don't know how to start this. I just became 18. When I was young I remember that I was very ""friendly"" and had a lot of empathy and love to offer. But all of that was faced by family abuse at home and bullying at school. Bullying was making fun of me in general and sometimes it got physical. No one actually cared. ""True friends"" like what I saw on tv shows such as Gravity Falls and many other shows in the same genre where there is no bullying and they are good emotional support was a dream. Comparing myself back then and now. I changed a lot. I used to try to appease my bullies now the first thing I do after getting bullied is think of how can I ruin his life not like murder or anything illegal but more like what can I do that won't get me in trouble but will also hurt them very much and they won't be able to do anything about it. I think there is a subreddit about revenge. It is something like that. nothing illegal but still hurt others and I wouldn't care about how much will it hurt them and I see them as ""enemies"" if that makes sense. I used to try to avoid those who will bully me now I am standing u for myself so I can count them as ""enemies"". I used to feel bad for others now it makes me kind of happy if I don't like them. I used to get abused by my parents but time passed and I kept the hatred in me for years even thought the beating stopped and I am planning to leave them now while their marriage is falling apart and I don't feel a thing. I used to fantasize about being in a relationship with someone. Now when I think of what would it be like to share my life with someone else I laugh. I just don't care about it. I don't know where my life is going but I know that I just don't care about anything or anyone else, anyone except myself. From reading only these few lines you may think that I am suicidal and hate myself but it's quiet the opposite. Only not in a healthy way. I know that I am basically an asshole with a backup story to justify it. In my whole life I only opened up to one stranger at the internet who opened up to me first, and I did not say anything very personal. They told me that They are suicidal and I said I also was at one time very suicidal and actually tried it. That's all I said and yet I still cringe at it to this day. I don't wanna be seen as a ""poor little victim"". This is why I will never try to justify myself by bad past. This is not a tv show where you get to see some flashbacks of the bad guy everyone hates in order to feel a little sorry for before he dies. I know I am a not very good person but I don't feel like I should change. does that make any sense. I am not a psychopath who enjoys to hurt people.

Background first though im an only child of old school parents so i had to deal with my problems by myself and have only just recently broke through to my famioy that im not mentally sound and that i need to get away from them and the remnants of my past life.

    I was born and raised all over southern california and at 18 i moved to texas. With all of the moving i never really called anywhere home becaues i could never settle in.
Moving caused me to never keep friends around to protect myself emotionally.
   I turned to alot of bad things toward the end of my teen years and been stuck in the never ending loop of toxic people and personality restrictions both at home and at work. 
   The kicker is that in todays america its impossible to work for any less than 50 and hour to be self sufficient.
   I have spent the last 5 years trying to break that threshhold and that paywall of enjoying life and being myself for the first time.
   I have settled for buying a truck and a decent sized travel trailer to live out of (i dont have the trailer yet) amd moving away from the country area and moving closer to my nearest city. Ive realized that theres is so much to do and so many ways to enjoy being alive when you live closer to opportunity.
   When you live in the country there is very little to do besides drink, sleep, work, or find some ran through people to sleep around with.

I have been living in isolation for a while, not only due to COVID, but socializing problems and depression as well. 
I have no friends but I have a boyfriend. My boyfriend is much older than me and at a different stage of life. But he takes care of me and it’s going on pretty well. But he lives in a different country, and since I’m back at university I haven’t seen him (over 2 months) even though he could come at any moment (he owns his own business and he decided to stop working in September as he had earnt too much this year). 

I’ve been having issues at home, and I got depressed. I started missing school but I was studying online with some people from my university. A boy from my study group has been very nice and helpful since I shared that I wasn’t at my best moment. As my circadian rhythm is messed up and he doesn’t sleep much, we’ve been taking almost daily. Yesterday, he told me that he was going to a rave party and if I wanted to join.

I should say that I’ve gone down into depression this week and I’m struggling to get out of bed. I I’ve even missed an appointment with my psychologist and exams. 

I don’t know if going to the party would help me. He mentioned drugs. I don’t even drink. I don’t know if he finds me attractive and that’s why he wants me to go. Then I wouldn’t go. He knows I have a bf.

What shall I do? 
This could help me get better but it also could go very wrong. I’m at Avery weak spot at the moment, I really need to stop this episode from getting worse. But what if I go and things go southwards and I get even worse.",Getting very depressed and invited to a party. I also don’t know what to do to get out of the episode
2022-10-28 13:11:43,depression," Not sure if this is the right place or what.  Thought it would be so  forgive me for the rant, it has been in the works for a while and just  decided to pull the trigger.  I'm not here for therapy, just brutally  honest advice I suppose.  
 

I just turned 59 next .  Maybe that is what scares me.   I have had a decent life: oldest of 3, Stay at home mom (was the 60's)  But I have never felt right about myself.  Diagnosed with clinical  depression about 45 years ago and have been to many shrinks and been on  everything from Adderall to Zoloft.. nothing helps.  I mostly make due  by smart ass comments to function.  
 

Have failed at pretty much everything I do: Went to college in the early  '80s for computer programing.  (Think computers in the 80' in Seattle  area.)  Didn't work out due to my stupid planning.  Went into Military  in 84 but got improper training and was pushed out in 86 with the  cutbacks.  Got married because I thought that is 'what you do'.  First  few years were great, but that soured too.  Got gig working for the  State but got injured and when I felt better the doctor wouldn't release  me.  Lost that job but got 1 year college in 2002; and went for  Computer Networking.  Half way through the market bubble popped and went  form you knowing how to start a computer gets you a job to needing 4  years degree and 2 years experience.  Depressed, I attempted suicide,  but failed at that too.  
 

Bumbled around until I got a brain tumor.   Now I am on disability with no hearing or balance on my right side.   You know when you stand up and get dizzy?  I feel like that all the  time.  
 

Seeing a therapist; but doesn't seem to be working.Not like the movies  where they tell you what is wrong, you are supposed to realize your  problem yourself and fix it with no guidance.  living in Section 8  apartment in home town just getting by with son (late 20s) who is  working as a plumbers apprentice and wife who was separated from but  lost her living but nowhere else to go out of the kindness of my heart.     
 

Been working on a book because I always wanted to write, but writers block is strangling me.  
 

Thought a road trip a few years ago would snap me out of my funk; but pandemic and gas prices killed that.  
 

I am mainly posting all this as therapy, I guess.  Not expecting an intervention or anything.  Say what you want, I can take it.

2022-10-28 12:20:06,depression,"Hi there. 
I’m not sure how this works. I mostly came here as an outlet to write down my thoughts. Without going into my past trauma, just be aware I’ve been through a lot of grief and depression for a girl in her twenties. 
It might not make sense but I can’t think of anything else to do with what I’m feeling. 
My depression always used to come in waves since I was younger in elementary school. The last 10 months has been the worst it’s ever been.
I’ve been experiencing this “hazy” state of mind - never felt this bad and detached from reality like this before. I’ve been living it for months. I know I need to get out of it but I’m comfortable and feel safe here? It’s so hard to explain. It’s a lonely and sad place. I don’t want to hangout with friends or talk with them on the phone. Always feels like a chore. 
I don’t smoke a lot of weed to get high but I do have a THC pen that I take hits of (majority of the day) to help with the constant anxiety and fatigue o feel from depression. I’m not high throughout the day but it helps with my appetite, sleep and anxious thoughts. This has been going on for a year. Nothing makes me want to wake up in the morning and once I do eventually get out of bed, I eat breakfast and have a tea and end up just wanting to go back to bed. No motivation whatsoever and just want to watch shows, nap and to not be bothered. I am not exercising whatsoever and I’m only brushing my teeth every couple of days. Even showering seems exhausting.
I miss my friends and I want to find someone to share my life with one day, when I’m in a better place. But shit…
What is this, just plain old really bad depression?

2022-10-28 10:18:48,depression,"Hi. This is my story for anyone willing to listen.

I am a 22 year old female living in a big city in Canada, i live with my siblings, parents and sister in law. My house included my dad (72) my mom (60) my brother (26) his wife (25) my sister (25) her twin, my other brother (25) me (22) my younger brother (21).

My upbringing was traumatic but I try and shrug it off. My parents both have family histories of mental illness and generational trauma, it seems it passed down onto my parents based on the way they treated me and my siblings growing up. I was living in fight or flight mode for years and wasn't conscious of myself until a few years ago so I understand or at least try to understand why my parents were so hard on me and my siblings growing up.

My first ever childhood memory was watching my dad run after my mom with a random object in an attempt to hit her and my grandfather running after them to try and stop them. I remember being so tiny I could only move my legs and arms. I remember being so tiny and powerless and somehow having enough comprehension despite not being able to walk or chew yet still know it was wrong. My parents were extremely strict growing up, this too I justified because I told myself they just wanted me to be safe and when I have children I'd also be very weary of strangers and look after my children obsessively. But I had no life. I was the girl with the strictest parents and as a result of never being able to meet with friends, I hardly made any. And if I ever made any, it was restricted in how often we could talk or meet up. Hence the friendships never went anywhere. Still, I understood why my parents are the way they are. I was beaten a lot as a kid. I was 12 years old (I was attending an all girls school) and I had a male friend who i was talking to on a tablet of mine and my father almost killed me. I passed out from being hurt so much. My relationship with my mother has always been so off. She has always despised me for having the rights and the life she always wanted but never had access to. I try so hard to please her but I cant seem to. Still, I forgive my parents. I care for them and love them deeply. I know it's not my duty but every day I try to somehow heal their inner child. They had such hard lives. My father and mother were deep in poverty and had to work from young ages and support their families, they gave up their identity and their lives and never got to be children. They never got to heal. My parents are so much better now and I think old age has helped them. We moved to Canada when I was 4 years old and due to my father having no Canadian background academically, he wasn't able to secure a job here. He could only find hard labour jobs which he couldn't do due to a back injury and it was odd that this was the only job he could secure considering the fact that he has his PhD and got that through a scholarship because he was the top student in the whole province back home. He was that intelligent. Due to this reason, he lived back home from 2004 until 2020 when he finally retired from the company he worked for years since he was 15 years old and he came and started to live with us. Between 2004 and 2020, he studied at a Canadian university and got a degree but still secured no job because of his English. I can't even fathom how difficult it was for him as a father to stay away from his family, he provided for us and stayed all alone. I can't imagine the sacrifice all that takes. My fathers youngest brother passed away in a car accident and he has cared for his brothers wife and his children financially since the accident in 2002 and has taken care of his parents until they passed. He has four brothers (excluding the one who passed) of which he is the eldest and he personally helped all of them with school and at age 30 when he built his first house, gave them all a piece of it equally despite them never financially contributing in any way, they never helped my grandparents or my uncles family after my uncle passed. My dad sponsored them and helped them to come abroad and worked as a teen to help with their school and they all now live in the U.S. and make more than all of my family combined but my dad has never and will never ask for help nor have they ever given help.

My mother worked as a nurse and resigned shortly after my eldest brother was born. After moving to Canada my mom got seriously ill and has never recovered since then. We somehow magically managed to get a house in 2017 and we've been living in it since. The mortgage was always difficult but it was much better than 7 people being cramped in a 2 bedroom apartment. We were all older and needed privacy. Since my dad lived back home, the currency difference is pretty large and his salary was only enough to cover 30% of the mortgage. So he did many other side hustles on the side such as having a Second Cup Coffee Franchise back home which eventually flopped and many other ideas such as real estate. I hate when people say poor people choose to be poor and never try. I've never seen anyone work as hard as my father has. And still his situation is like this.

Over the past 2-3 years, since my dad retired it has been especially hard to make ends meet. My dad never ""retired"" though. Just from his job for decades he worked at, ever since he moved back to canada he has been working uber non-stop. If he stops even for one day, we wont be able to make mortgage payments.

I have been working since I was 15 years old. I started working at a flea market and it was so gross, older men made me uncomfortable every day with things they said, my boss was so mean to me and soon after I turned to retail and now I work at a bank. Since I was 15 I have been working and when i first started working it was to give myself an allowance for outside food or clothes or to pay my phone bill since my family couldn't and if they could I felt guilty about it so I worked for it. For the last 3 years I have worked to help my family financially. I have been working since i was 15 years old and I am now 22 years old. I feel SO burnt out I cannot fathom how my father who has lived his whole life working feels. I can't even imagine working since I was a child and now at 72 I still work. I can't fucking believe it, I can't imagine the pain and the toll it takes on you to work your ENTIRE life. I've worked for 7 years and it has felt like my whole life.. all of it. I feel so drained. I worked during high school and I joined university and wanted to focus on it but I couldnt afford textbooks or coffee or anything so I picked up a part time job, i have adhd and having a job while studying was so hard. Something really terrible happened while I was in university and it caused me to drop out. When i dropped out i started work full time at the bank as a bank teller and it helped me with my family. I was so depressed when I was in university that I did so poorly, but I always knew I wanted an education. I lived in a country that made it so possible to get your education, student loans were an option and it was so possible. I came from a country where a university degree was so unknown seemed like such a privilege to have access to it so easily so i always knew i wanted a bachelors degree. Last year i joined university again and have been attending university full time while also working full time.

I don't mean to complain. I know people have it so hard. I know many others have way it worse than me and that's why i hate to complain. I should be thankful. and i am. i am also just so tired. i cant see my dad deteriorate in front of me but i also feel like im going to die from how much i've been exposed to and how much i've worked over the years. i just want to give up. i dont feel like i have the energy anymore.

I was depressed before i knew what the word was, i disassociated for the first time when i was 4 years old. It's only gotten worse. Please pray things get easier. I have never felt like a child, i've never felt like just a little girl, like a human. Recently i got a job at a new bank so i no longer work as a bank teller, the pay is better and the youngest person at this bank was 35... im now the youngest person. the person whose postion i took over retired, everyone on my team is 40 or above and the cubicles hold 300 people. and i just feel so lost,. its my first week there so trying to stay positive. i know im so thankful to have a job, especially in this economy and this state of the world. but i cant help but still just not be happy. does this make me a bad person? i feel so tired and i can hardly focus, i feel so tired all the time. i just want to relax for once in my life. The world is a beautiful place but not one for a poor, mentally ill person..",i feel like i am being punished for something

I don't have much money, but recently, I decided to say fuck it and buy myself something nice. So I ordered this aroma diffuser which looked pretty cool, it's shaped as a volcano and it looks like fire comes out of it. I thought 'maybe it could help my mind relax a bit', you know? Maybe it's stupid but .... :(

I was worried it wouldn't arrive or be stolen upon arrival (I always expect bad shit to happen, because it always does - even my mom is like ""how can you have so much bad luck??""), but this morning it finally showed up after 6 long days of waiting. I was so happy nothing went wrong for once. I've been checking every day on the delivery app, anticipating its arrival.

So I open it up, and .... it's not the volcano diffuser. It's a monstrous big and clinically white one. Even its shape looks like something from a hospital. I *hate* hospitals. I hate everything that reminds me of them.

It's all the other shit that went wrong before that, and now this one little simple thing I wanted to go right.... also didn't go right. I'm just... cursed. This is how everything I try to do pans out. I'm not even kidding. I feel like nothing is ever going to get better, no matter how hard I try. What's even the point anymore?

Please don't tell me any version of ""cheer up, better days will come"" or ""think positive"" because it's been like this for 16 years, everything I do to change it ends up like this.

I also do not plan to have kids because I feel nobody would love me this way and even if someone does love me I believe is going to disapear eventually and the person will leave me.

I shave myself, shower everyday, wear cologne, and basically treat myself good. I try to live as well as possible. I try to eat fruits even though I don't like it much.

I'm lacking friends and being loved though. I feel so goddamn lonely. I have close to no people I can call by phone that aren't family. I have so little amount of friends at 17 years old. I dropped out of school due to our education system being garbage. I want to stop playing video games. This is gonna sound bad but I feel like i need to 'get a life'.

I don't feel like doing anything besides sitting at the house and wasting most important times of my life. I can't get over the feeling of missing out. What can I do from home to make this feeling go away? I learnt almost perfect English from home. Which is like the only thing I can tell to people about myself. I don't feel like i have an important enough personality. Should i try and learn more languages? How can I gain value? Or how can I go out and not miss out on life?

Everything feels hard the past month. I had severe social anxiety back in middle school. I had no confidence and was bullied constantly. I am recovering from it but it's feelings is coming back again. I was on the edge back then. I almost took away my life. Couldn't do it to my mom though, I didn't have a father figure growing up and I love my mom more than myself. I can't explain things to her. And even when I try, I just froze and say 'nevermind, it's nothing'. Would it help if i tried to open up to my mom? She is very caring.

2022-10-27 16:15:52,depression,"I grew up in a very Toxic household. Mom used to be completely toxic and childish while who couldn't handle her like an Adult used to get extremely violent. There were days when my mom used to scream out of pain so loudly that  a ten year old me had to cover the ears of my  7 year old brother and take him far away from the house where no body could find us. I used to sit on a rock and cry while he used to play in the mud.

On the other hand, my mom didn't back down either, she found more and more reasons to instigate fights, heavily insult my dad and finally after hours of silent listening to her toxic wards, he used to become violent. Entire childhood was like this.
On the other side, I myself was an extremely manipulative and toxic child in  school who often was too easy to identify as manipulative, i could unleran this train only after I turned twenty.

They joined us in a toxic school where teachers were famous for low quality teaching, students known for being the worst, and teachers who caned students more than they actually taught students.
Both my parents didn't care how much we suffered in the school , never thought of joining us in a proper healthy school. I used to think it was because of our financial status as a middle class family 2ho couldn't afford schools with good education, but later in life I discovered that , it was infact possible for them to join us in a good school which were charging less fees than mine was. It was their negligence that let to my suffering.

After the Schooling until tenth grade, my dad paid a huge amount of money to join me in an extremely toxic institute, where they stuffed 80 students in a small room without ventilation for 12 hours of constant teaching, most of which I could never understand because I didn't have the necessary basics. Whenever I complained about it, they just told me that only through struggles that I can succeed. I used to sit in the last bench, with stinking shoes which were soaked of sweat from my anxiety feet. I used to cry for hours there, neither the teachers not the parents were allowing me to even breath fresh air. Finally I rebelled up and decided not to study or listen to classes but just  sit there in the class.

Now it's been an year since I have done my Masters in Business. I worked as a lecturer because I was so depressed to even attend a corporate interview but somehow I was able to be happy teaching. Even then they asked me to get a ""man's job"" which pays well and not a time pass teaching job which doesn't. Entire town gave respect except for my parents because I was not earning more money.
 
And while I was working, I guess my father too was feeling guilty about his behaviour he attempted on his life, but instead got his leg severely injured.

I was the one who picked him up from a pool of blood and took care of both my traumatised parents for 6months, putting my mental health aside, and working full time as a lecturer.After he was alright, i was the one who made sure that he won't lose his job by potraying the attempt as an accident and convincing his company's medical team that he was physically and mentally fit.

Only after everything was alright,I began to travel. I thought if I go away my depression will reduce and it infact did. I was feeling more confident than ever, Hopeful about future , made a proper plan of taking an Educational loan to go abroad to study and possibly earn well. Yet again, they said that I was too unstable to do so.
I had lost hope, I thought I should end it, but before that I wanted to confront both of them. I wanted an apology and some financial support till I get back on my feet with a functional mind. But it all spiralled out very badly. He asked me not come back and that he wouldn't not support me financially. 
Now my mind is dysfunctional, it's been months since I was able to properly think or work. My meds were not working. Even if I told the doctor to change or even changing the doctor themselves is not helping. So I forcibly took some gold from my own home and moved out.
Now I don't know If I will survive all this new trauma I originated. The guilt of not being able to function and earn, and the guilt of stealing is killing me. My mind has become numb and I am constantly confused . I  used to have proper plans for my career and my family, now I don't even know if I will be able to survive barely an year.

so I begin to change all of my passwords so nobody can log in and see everything when im gone. but my dumbass couldn’t figure out how to change the laptop one. i was trying so hard to figure out how to change my laptop password that i ended up getting mad as fuck. 

then, my neighbor suddenly started barking like a dog outside because he’s drunk and angry. 

it ruined the fucking moment and now im just kind of dumbfounded because this grown ass man was BARKING. this is also the second time he’s done that too LOL.

2022-10-27 16:12:51,depression,"I don't know where to begin. I'm 14 years old and don't know what I have, all I know is that my doctor put me on Prozac when I was 12. As long as I can remember my dad has always been a very VERY short tempered person with little to no patience. I can't remember much anymore (which I should probably get checked) but he's always been very loud and shouted alot even when I was just a toddler. He usually worked from Monday to Saturday so until around 5.00pm which was okay, but when he came home he'd start giving out about everything, from the state of the kitchen table which he wrecked to me not immediately giving him the remote to watch some horse racing bullshit. I was miserable and can remember coming onto this website and the age of seven and looking up reasons as to why I feel so numb. My dad would put pressure on me when I was young, I remember a night where I cried to him because I couldn't understand what was wrong with me and why I felt this way, and all he did was tell me I didn't know what stress was and told me about our house bills, that we could be kicked out and living on the streets, the starving kids in Africa and the cost to just feed me and let me have an education. How comforting! Honestly when I get into arguments (aka when he takes something i hesitantly say the wrong way) with him now I either want to shoot myself or brutally murder him saw-style.

 I can't talk to my friends either as they all take it as a joke which is my fault. I can't really tell people how I feel because I just start bawling uncontrollably so I leave answers short when I go see any counsellors or any of the other people I have to see. I'm honestly severely scared of school and outdoors in general. When i'm in school my heart is literally racing and i'm always at edge and in public if i walk around a corner and a person is there I jump as if I just murdered somebody. It makes me feel sick and I've threw up in school about 8 times. 7 times before school too. I had nearly 100 absences last year. I'm really stupid too and just don't do well in school. I am terrible at maths, science, history, irish, geography, yadayadayada.

 I've felt this way since I was 7 but didn't completely understand, so I thought I just had a sore stomach but I guess not. I never have my friends over either. I kind of feel alone. I daydream alot to the point where I'm literally certain that without a doubt i have maladaptive daydreaming disorder, which I don't even really mind because being stuck in my head is better than this shitshow happening in my real life. I went to camhs about a month ago with my mam and dad. I told them about my dad (which resulted in me crying to a point i couldn't speak after 5 mins) and they said they hard informed child protective services or something like that. They explained it to my dad and he just said ok and we went home. He was okay for that day but everything went back to normal after that. I'm just really stuck and don't know what to do, I have zero plans or hope for the future and kind of hope the world ends before I turn 18. Thanks for listening to me winge and any advice or just comments would be very much appreciated as i'm starting to think i'm not even a real person. :)",big ass vent with no structure.
2022-10-27 15:56:40,depression,"Hi, ive never been much of a redditor or ever posted on this before but somone special to me said i should give it a shot because it helped her, but i cant talk to her about this trauma. Anyway im a 24M reserve marine (currently serving) and i still live with my parents...ive been in many relationships romanticly but only 1 sided being im the one that always put in effort and never got it back.
I tend to talk in cryptic ways out of habit due to the need to hide whats really happening from my family and that my parents always butt into my private life, as my mother 58F still treats me like a child as im her only son, while my father 57M refuses to understand how it is to be young in this new age so he simply cant understand my pain. Onto my actual point though and what i want to really fix in my head.  Being cheated on and having a 1 sided love life has made me afraid to meet somone new, not wanting to be hurt again tends to form a very forcefeild like armor to meeting anyone new. 
Ive been dating somone 27F for the last couple months and she has been the complete opposite from any other woman ive been with. Shes sweet, kind, genuienly caring, and absolutly beautiful in so many ways and ive fallen for her so hard, and she knows how i feel. 
I havent said ""i love you"" to her directly not once yet, although every time i drop her off at home or she leaves to drive home, from the safety behind the window ive said it out loud knowing she cant hear me. 

She told me to post about stuff like this because its too much to talk about with her and i dont want to push her away with this at all. But i feel so deep in love with her and ive tried to express how much i do in little ways. 
Im so in love with her that ive been trying my absolute hardest to better my mental state as ive never been on meds and only been in 1 year of therapy for whole other reasons.

Ive been fighting myself by myself my whole life as an only child and as am adult with noone to really understand me besides her.

My problem is that most of my trauma stems from past relationships. Being cheated on, used, abused verbally and physically, and being the only person to show effection for none in return has made me so obsessively aware of even the slightes changes in behavior or style or expression or voice tone. Down to how people text. Ive been avle to trust my gut for so long in this paranoia and awareness that it became trust issues for anyone other than myself and what ive been through.
For example the woman im dating 27F posted a picture today that she also sent to me as a ""sexy pic"" though it was just a selfie. Seems normal and innocent in feelin herself and the outfit she chose. Which is great i want her to feel confident and happy.

Where i messed up was that i noticed way too many details because of todays conversations with her and her actions up to then and what was in the picture. In my eyes and my traumatized mind i see this; shes dressed to look very attractive and a bit revealing(crop top, leggings with a very open coat) an outfit that seriously shows off her curves and she does cosplays and costumes so she opted for a silver hair wig though shes naturally brunette. So clearly dressed to go out and look hot right?
She took the case off her phone, to me thats a change in style and outword apperance.
Now the conversations earlier today lead me to belive she was stayin home from work for a mental health day, as she does from time to time so nothing off there, but late at night when she has the week off shes going out lioe that...without me....so im feeling lied to and insulted that while im very clearly wanting to see her and have full opportunity to do so, while she says she wants to see me. She goes out without me. The background of the photo was nothing ive seen before and ive been to her apartment as her parents house before so i would recognize it. But it looked nothing like either place. 
So my first thought was that shes at another man house right now forgetting i even exist and lieing to me about not seeing other people.

Rant over

Im full on in love with her but she doesnt belive me and from day one ive been committed to her 100% i cant even look at other women and feel attracted to them because i only want her.
I cant even watch porn anymore because i only want to experience her.

Part of me if posting on here because she may or may not see this. So i guess i write her a note. Ill only use initials to refer to her from this point on. If you arent her then the next part isnt for you anyway but if tou have advice on how i can handle getting my trauma and paranoia and worry out of my head so i can continue building this relationship please domt hesitate to tell me.



Dear, AD

    I knew from the moment i met you that you were special.  You were so cute when we met i still remember the outfit you had on.  When we left the var to talk for the first time i felt even more comfortable amd amazed i found somone so different from everyone else. 
You were kind and open minded but still very set in your opinions. To me that showed you are a great listener and advice giver.  You showed how strong and confident you were in the things you said and still say.
Each moment we spend together i fall deeper in love with you.  I know you move slow and i am being as patient as i can be because you are so worth the effort.  I dont mind your mental illness or you occasional low self esteem or the times you feel so frustrated and emotional.  I can see past the negative and see the beautiful young woman you are.
  To me you are perfect in so many ways and i keep finding more and more in you that i love.
The adorable voice you have when your sleepy. The way you style your clothing amd how versatile it is. Your smile is so perfect it brings joy to everyone around. Those beautiful green eyes you have, green eyes are so rare so its fitting for how rare of a person you are.  

  Your height and body feels perfect to me amd we mesh together so well that holding you is the best feeling i could ask for. Your natural brunette hair contrasts your bright eyes and adorable face so well. The way you care about children in your life amd the amount of effort and attention you out into them to make theyre days better. Your so adventurous and spontainious that each moment is like a quest in a fantasy world.
  Your creativity and passiom for your art is awe inspiring that i am always blown away by what you create.  I have never felt more safe in my life than i do when youre by my side, youve let me vent and cry. You gave me the much needed love ive been so deprived of my whole life and you actually put in effort to make me happy.  

  You are so special to me ive had dreams of what our lives together could be. 2 young adukts living theyre best lives seeing the world and experiencing the beauty of this place. Moveing to a country that respects us as human beings unlike where we currently are. 

   Ive dreamt of us being together in so many scenarios and i think of you so much throughout my days that the image of you in my head drives me to keep going and keep bettering myself.

Though i need to better myself for me, i truelly better myself not only for myself but also for you so you can be strong and continue to be confident and keep fighting your own battles head on with no fear becaue you will know that i will always be there to support you in your time of need. I know you dont need a knight in shining armor or prince charming.
  In my eyes we are a couple of knights in dented rusted slashed armor that has seen battle and seen pain but our armor keeps holding up. With your mental amd emotional support in my own battles you are activly repairing my armor. If you would let me i want to do the same for you. 

    If you ever see this dont tell me

Just know that i really do love you and i want to commit to you because you and i felt the energy that day. It was so magnetizing.  If there is a higher power it has pushed us together for a reason. I feel it was the start of getting to know our soulmates. A couple old souls finding eachother once again in a new life.

Anyways, i’ve been struggling with depression for the past 4 years- until my counsellor referred me to a doctor (i was quite scared to and didn’t have the funds until recently.) I got a full blood panel done and saw my doctor about it today, everything was fine but my B12 was low. If you don’t know side effects of a B12 deficiency some of which are irritability, heightened anxiety, memory loss, numbness and tingling, fertility problems, sleeping issues such as insomnia, chronic fatigue issues and of course, depression. B12 deficiencies often get missed because of how easy it is to attribute those symptoms to other things, without doing blood. so many of my issues were attributed to trauma or hereditary things. my doctor said that i wasn’t absorbing it and there was no way to know how long this had been going on. apparently once i get B12 injections i’ll be feeling better. mentally too.

i don’t know how to feel. i feel like everything i’ve gone through- all the things i’ve done and thought, attribute to nothing because i have low B12",I found out my depression was probably caused by a B12 deficiency today and i’m not coping well

“In imposing this corrupt, simplistic model on our internal worlds, it has succeeded in hijacking our own perceptions of ourselves–our lives, our personalities, our feelings and experiences–spinning them into a catalog of phony, pseudoscientific “diagnoses” that are ripe for economic exploitation. It’s a woefully incomplete picture of the brain and mind that makes little room for normal variants, and maximizes economic opportunities. It distracts the public from the vast ignorance that remains–projecting a false image of clinical mastery to appease our audience, and to reassure ourselves.

It is this delusional body of pseudoscience that is the main target of my work here. I want to inform the public of psychiatry’s ignorance, how science is being abused in my profession, and the dangers of a simplistic treatment model that is based more on economic success than its clinical results.

Much of the truth of psychiatric disorders is unknowable to us at this time. The general public is entitled to know what isn’t the truth, and to understand how science is being abused by my profession. But to do so, the public first has to have a clear understanding of how science works--because the scientific method is how consensus truth is established in the natural world.

Once you understand the process of science, it will become obvious that modern psychiatry isn’t at all based on science. Because good science is driven by doubt and skepticism–and it is increasingly clear that the modern psychiatric model is primarily driven by ego and economic investment.”

2022-10-27 14:47:25,depression,"This year, my depression has been at the worst state it's ever been in my life . I got my heart broken by someone who I still love and thought was my soulmate. My baby brother passed away last month. I pushed away all of my friends and haven't been responding to their messages. I'm 21 and only completed two semesters of college and haven't been back in a year. I have no direction in life and I can't even maintain a clean room. I workout, I go on hikes, I try to eat healthy, I've been doing a lot of healing and finding solitude in my loneliness. Yet I still cry myself to sleep every night. I have crippling anxiety that is putting me in a state of constant panic. I can't even make an appointment for a psychiatrist because I'm too anxious to make a phone call. 

When I really look at myself, it seems like I'm destined to commit suicide. It just seems so fitting. I can't handle the harsh reality of this world. I'm overly emotional and take everything to heart. Judging by the patterns of my mental health throughout each year, every winter gets worse. And now after everything I've been through this year, I don't understand how I'm supposed to get through this winter. I'm actually scared. I have the option of going on dating apps but that defeats the purpose of learning to find security in being on my own. I can't keep relying on a relationship in order to be alive.

 The wedding would also have been a Halloween party. All our friends and family would've been invited to come in costume. She would have been dressed as Belle, while I was going to be the Beast in the classic dancing attire. That used to be our favorite Disney movie. That was our song. I haven't been able to watch that movie since then.

I've tried therapy. I've tried meds. I've tried putting myself back out there. I don't know what else to do or say. I'm just lost. I have been for two, soon to be three years.

2022-10-27 13:58:55,depression,"The best word for it, I spiral. I get better and I get worse, like a rollercoaster just getting flung up and down and up and down. But I've not spiraled quite this far since the last time I tried to hurt myself. 

I isolated myself, as I always end up doing. Now Max won't talk to me, which is fair, one more friend I'll never see again. Part of me mourns, but a now much larger part is glad that I now have one less person to disappoint. Because edventually, I disappoint everyone. Rollercoaster has to go back down, and I've disappointed everyone again. 

I finally have the option of therapy, quite literally just got my new insurance last week, so I *can* afford therapy now. But, what good would it do? I can't put into words why it all sucks, there's no good reason I think. I hate myself, but for no good reason. Realizing how pointless it is doesn't make me hate myself any less, what could a therapist tell me that would change that? How can you reason with the unreasonable?

It's october, I've been on a horror kick, chasing old movies and games hoping the thrill would make me feel alive. But it's all just pixels. I went to the store today, everyone's eyes were on me, I couldn't bring myself to breath near anyone, I held my breath and audibly gasped after I past them because my lung capacity is shit. The outside, life, people, judgement, that's what's really horrifying, no movie can top it. When I think about my own brain, the things it conjures up and tells me, it's Lovecraftian. 

I didn't plan to live to 18, and now I'm navigating in the dark. I've lost so many friends, hurt so many people, just this year. I burden my family, emotionally and financially, I worry my best friends and ignore the ones I can't muster up the energy to interact with.

2022-10-27 13:47:10,depression,"TW: loss, abuse

Just an FYI I posted this in depression meals on Facebook too just because I’m trying to get as much advice as I can. Now, here we go:

TW Cancer, s**cide

My dad has stage 4 cancer, and has decided it is a good excuse to do say anything he chooses at any given moment. I moved back in with my parents because it would be impossible for my to handle it on her own, but I can’t take it anymore. He’s always been an abusive person, primarily mentally/emotionally except for a few rare times in when he has hit me and a few more times when he’s been aggressive with my mother. Initially his ￼anger and complete lack of censoring himself this time around was primarily just him whining endlessly about how he’s put upon and he’s the only one who does anything while we wait on him hand and foot. He then progressed into telling me what an extreme failure I am and how I never contribute anything. Then it graduated to just randomly sometimes calling me a “giant bag of sh*t”. Last night, we hit a new low. He wasn’t feeling well and decided to sleep on the couch. Unfortunately, he goes to bed pretty early so effectively any activity in our family room or kitchen after 7:30pm would be disruptive to him. I was trying to grab some cheese and crackers as quietly as I could and all the while he was just listing all my perceived faults the top of which at this point of course was that I am, “the most inconsiderate person alive.” So, I’m getting agitated, and I’ve been sick so I have a runny nose and am sniffling. This caused him to start into how I’m so loud and so rude. I was really aggravated at this point and so admittedly I snapped a bit and said, “next time I’ll be sure to just stop breathing so I don’t bother you.” And he said, no exaggeration, no hyperbole, “if you did you’d be doing me a favor.”

It is honestly the most awful and hurtful thing anyone has ever said to me. So I just left and ignored everyone for the rest of the night. Then this morning he was telling me how unacceptable it is that I locked my door last night and if I didn’t like that then i needed to find a new place to live. So I was pretty upset, but I tried as rationally as I could to tell him that what he said hurt me so much especially because he knows I’ve been hospitalized 3 times and have dealt with mental health problems for over 10 years. He got this rage on his face and started cursing at me and screaming that he would never say that and how messed up I was etc. etc. made only more absurd because he mis tirade said something like “you’re mentally ill clearly!” but said meant as an insult. So he started threatening me and told me to get the f**k out of HIS house or he’d call the cops.

I made a plan to go stay with some friends for a while starting tomorrow but until then I’m at the Sheetz as it’s the only place I could walk to and I just moved so I have no friends or anyone in this town. My mom has texted me saying I need to come back so we (him and me) can talk about it and I told her I had no intention of speaking to him for the foreseeable future. Then he started texting me about how horribly I treated him but being so nasty and that he’s sick and uño clearly couldn’t care less. I know what he did was wrong, but I feel so guilty leaving my mom there and I know I shouldn’t but I keep wondering  what all of this is my fault because I wasn’t more amenable to his needs I guess? But also I can’t ever tell him that something he did or said was hurtful because even using I language and as best I can portray it as a me problem and even so every time I get more than 2 books, notebooks, etc. Sitting in the single restroom crying eating combos. Sorry this was so long, I just feel so alone.",It used to be him yelling about something; now it’s all about saying whatever will hurt the most.

I’m so ashamed of myself, but somehow that shame isn’t enough to make me do anything. I feel hopeless but it’s all my fault, I’m lazy.

i hate self-pitying myself but i don't know how to branch out. i always isolate myself when i'm lonely. when the slightest inconvenience happens and i can't seem to express the reason why i'm upset to my friends. life just consists of working, going to the gym, and school. i don't see what the future really holds for me.

It is destroying me that people don’t.",I feel like I’m the boy who cried wolf
2022-10-27 13:22:20,depression,"I'm out of options. I've reached what feels like a guarantee that nothing will change for the better from here on out.

Now if I went to a therapist, I can only assume what they would do in my situation. They'll try working me around it. Getting me to just live with it, to cope with it. They can't undo the art pains I have.

About two and a half years now, this same thing has haunted me. And as much as I love talking about it, I'll admit it for once that this is merely the straw that broke the camel's back. I already tried shooting myself in 2016. And I failed.

It's the single biggest regret of my entire life. I could've been nonexistent by now. I wouldn't have had to experience an ounce of the envy. I wouldn't have had to find a version of myself who didn't fail in every aspect. I wouldn't have had to witness my ideas and desires already executed and perfected. I wouldn't have had to end up slamming my head into walls out of the frustration, the anguish, and the emptiness it all brought onto me from then on.

I have no passion, and I can't force it either. So I can't enjoy the process. So I won't just do it, and I won't go anywhere.

It's like the universe is looking me dead in the eyes, and asking. ""Why haven't you necked yourself yet?""

Because I'm scared. It's because I'm scared. No amount of being pissed off and resentful of the universe for existing will make me feel even slightly comfortable or entitled to something that isn't just more bullshit waiting patiently on the other side.

Even if I somehow pushed through this passion barrier of mine, it'd be years of work before any of it looked tolerable. My ideas can't even be considered my own anymore. And awful free-time lacking adult life is kicking in, in a world that already provoked a suicide attempt out of me before any of this art crap, way back when I was just 14.

I'll say it yet again. Everything I should've been is already out there. And I'm not exactly puncturing a hole in the art spectrum with my death, or just lack of contribution.

I'll never write anything worth reading. I'll never compose anything worth listening. I'll never draw anything worth witnessing. I'll never do anything worth acknowledging.

And sure, I'll *never* do these things if I'm dead. And if I'm gonna die anyways, why not try? So I tried.

I tried once, it felt awful. Soul-draining, tiring. I ended up going nowhere, and haven't touched drawing for 8 months now.

Then I tried again, something else. Doesn't work, my circumstances forbid it. Probably wouldn't have gone anywhere anyways.

And then I tried again, something else.

""dime-a-dozen""

""boring""

And I couldn't agree more. That's just what happens when I try to do anything. Not like it would've gone anywhere in the end, it depended on me being capable of art, but I'm just a complete failure.

Everything sucks. I hate it all. Nothing interests me anymore.

My only dreams are perpetual infeasibilities.

The days of having free time and getting enough sleep to make waking up worth it are long gone.

I wish my dad loved my mom.

I don't want to die. I don't want to do anything anymore.

I just wish I never existed.

The only positive thing I have to say, is that all this thinking about limbo as a concept and comparing it to my life, reminds me of the game LIMBO. That was a cool game.",Art limbo has hollowed me

I knew I could never replace him and it was inevitable that she’d choose him over me. What good was I as a husband anyway? They knew each other since she was 18. That’s a really long head start on what we had. I always knew I was just a way to kill time and I knew all her motivation was for his approval. Yes it hurt having her ex boyfriend tell me that he decided that our marriage needed to end and that no matter what, she’d come running to him if he snapped his fingers. Still, thank you Anne. I cherish these scars and this mess you made of my mind state. You were the last person who gave me a little bit of happiness. You didn’t mean it when you said you loved me, but I let myself enjoy the lie until I couldn’t have it anymore. At least you pretended I was worth keeping around. I can’t say the same for anyone else and I DON’T expect anyone else to even pretend. It’s not worth the wasted energy. As always I love you Annie and for all the shitty times, I’ll always only remember the times I fooled myself and accepted the false truth. I just wish you’d continue hurting me, but you were never mine. My “I do” was sincere and came from the depths of my being, “yours was just there until he decided it to tell you it didn’t mean anything. Love always, Ryan.",Was told what I already know
2022-10-27 12:34:33,depression,"I’m lonely all my friends have had relationships and girls and I feel like the unwanted one. I put in all this work in the gym to look good and feel good but something just does not click with me and relationships. I’ve grown a lot and consider myself attractive o just don’t have the “game” to back it up. I always psych myself out and overthink whenever talking to women. 

Recently my friend who was very awkward around women just seemed to flip a switch and slept with two girls in the matter of a week. The insecurity and loneliness I feel is painful. It’s not right that I’m feeling jealousy over my friends success. I should be happy for him..I’m not sure if this is depression or not I’m sorry if my problems don’t match up to some of the other peoples problems on the sub.

I woke up tired and anxious as hell and had had that taught, itchy spot in my chest that lets me know I'm anxious but that I also want to scratch hard enough til I bleed to try to get the anxiety out. I left my work today having cried for a half hour on the phone with my friend, feeling low and tired and just, tired of me. I'm lonely, I'm useless, and I don't see myself getting better.
I'm no contact with my parents. My other family members are doing their own lives, and my friends have their own lives too. It's just me and my dog, and he's my best friend but I always doubt I'm doing right by him. 

I just wish I was getting better, and could have a more normal life. Not having to triple check everything all the time, feeling like taking care of myself and my apartment. I want to clean, I want to be on time, I want to paint again. I just. Don't, or can't. I'm disappointed in myself.

2022-10-27 12:31:27,depression,"My mother has Parkinson's and has mobility issues and needs help with certain things. She cannot live completely independently anymore  While she can probably get by for one day alone in the house without me my dog can't. 

We have a run so she wouldn't need to walk the dog but my dog has neurotic behavior that makes getting her to go out an ordeal. While I can pick her up and get her out when she gets stubborn my mother physically can't.

Now if had to stay in a hospital more than a day both of them are fucked. My mother no longer drives either. 

Let me be clear I do have a brother who lives 30 minutes away but it's a weird dynamic and it would become an issue quickly.

Basically if I had to go into the hospital for a week both my mother and dog can't survive. The dog literally would have to be given up for adoption and while my brother would have no choice but to deal with my mother it would be a miserable situation for her.

The idea that something like  me having a heart attack or some other medical emergency could literally fuck my mother's life up because aside from my brother there is literally no other family or friends and as I said the dynamic with my brother is complicated.

Thus worry adds to the mounds of stress I already deal with. I am all she and the dog can count on and I am deathly of the idea of not being there to take care of their needs. 

Its a becoming a genuine concern for me as I get older. In my early 50's now and health problems are starting to become a concern for me. Generally healthy but have elevated cholesterol and have had some erratic pancreatic enzyme levels in recent routine lab work that the doctors can't figure out as they can't find any issues with my pancreas nor am I having any physical symptoms.

Sorry if this post was kind of ramble and all over the place.",If I ever have to go into the hospital for anything at requires more than maybe a single night's stay both my dog and my elderly mother would be screwed.
2022-10-27 12:21:09,depression,"As mentioned in the title, I have not been told if I've been diagnosed. But I am on anti-depressants. However, they don't seem to be helping and I do not want to try the dice game of gambling on which medication works. Well, they probably work while they're in my system, but then fail to do anything after that, Which I think is normal. But there are times they don't work. But, even when they do work, it doesn't completely fix the issue. The most recent thing which makes my mood even worse is my refusal to shower. Even worse, I tested positive for COVID-19 2 years ago on December 22nd, 2020. I've been struggling to regain my sense of smell and taste completely for a while. But the thought of showering tanks my mood even more. Does anyone else have this issue with self-hygiene? Like I don't have this issue with brushing my teeth. Yet I can't seem to not get all depressed when I need to shower. I haven't showered for 4+ days. It makes me embarrassed to go out in public because I don't know if I smell, but can't get myself to actually shower.  I just can't say for sure if it's depression related, or me just being lazy, or a combination of the two. Hence I'm posting it here. I'm wanting external opinions.","Not officially been told I'm diagnosed, but on anti-depressants."

2022-10-27 11:49:07,depression,"I (23,f) have been with my bf (27,m) for more than 4 years now. We were initially just online casual texters (flirted a lot) which developed into full blown sexting and after like almost a year, it turned emotional. When we had just started texting and were flirting we knew it was all casual and there was no chance of us getting together. 

But we got attached emotionally,  and he confessed how much he loved me, and so did I. We still knew we could never  marry each other because we come from extremely orthodox families and both of our religions are different. We knew it would never happen. We thought of it for a while but it involved one of us converting to the partner's religion and leaving their family behind (context, I am from south east asia and this is mostly the norm here). But we couldn't even live for a second without each other. So we decided to just go with it and since he's older, and will get married before me, and it would get into an arranged marriage setting, we decided to end it when his family start looking for suitable matches for him. I think I should've mentioned it before that this was all online since we lived over 900 miles apart. So we were in a long distance, extremely attached, knew we'd have to breakup one day, but getting more closer every single day. Our love was just growing. We were obsessed with each other. Even after 3 years or so our honeymoon phase never died. Mostly because of him. He has treated me so well that my expectations have reached god level. I loved being spoilt by all the love he'd shown me. I loved him so much. We were together throughout thick and thin.

 And then, after almost 3.5 years or so, we finally got the chance to meet. It was finally happening. My family was moving to his city and they lived there for almost a year. And due to covid my university was fully online so even I could stay with them in his city for about 3-4 months. And we met every single day. We made out, we hugged kissed, and we developed a very deep physical intimacy as well. We always ALWAYS wanted to have sex, since, and ik a lot of people might find it weird, we started of as sexting, the sexual attraction was as deep as the emotional attachment. We were best friends and a couple, and we were extremely attracted to each other sexually as well. And I guess sexual attraction also was linked to our emotional being as well, since we didn't just wanna have sex for the sake of it, and since we are both virgins, we wanted each other to be our firsts. We really did. And we could've had sex when I was in his city but I was so scared and insecure that I kept saying we'll do it but not now. Now I wanna clear this up that I really wanted to do it, but I was just so insecure of my body that I just kept saying no in the hopes that we'll do all the other sexual stuff and slowly get to actually having sex later. We did all the other sexual stuff, but could never had sex due to me just being scared. 

After a few months I left, and it was hard going back into long distance, but then I had went back to meet him for a couple weeks when I was going to visit my parents. We were like that again, extremely close, so happy, that we didn't realise what was coming. And since we couldn't get an opportunity this time either, we couldn't have sex then either. 

After I went back, he joined a B school, in an another city, which was closer to mine. Much closer. And since that B school is a part of a huge University I was planning to apply for my research work there in January next year, so that atleast we could have lived together in the same city for once without being worried of our parents finding out about us for once.

 But things changed. He loved me still, but MBA put him under so much pressure that he kinda got super involved with his academics and we started drifting apart. We still talked everyday, we were not calling much (we used to call everyday for hours), and I changed. I was missing him so much that I developed an unhealthy attachment anxiety and started getting insecure, was shouting at him all the time, complaining that he doesn't gives me time at all. I tried to understand he was genuinely busy as well, and most days were fine, but then every 4-5 days I'd just suddenly start missing him and then get mad at him for not spending too much time with me. But then we had an open discussion and he said he feels like he has never made his father proud. He was very emotional, and I knew he was in extreme pain because he loves his dad. He said his parents wanted him to get married, and I knew they wont allow a love marriage, so it will be arranged. We always knew this. It's the same condition in my family as well, my parents would never allow this either. 

But it shattered me because I realised the time to end it was extremely close. Due to which I started panicking and kept pushing him to continue like how we always were for few more months because I was applying there, and if  accepted I'd have gone there. He was eagerly waiting for me earlier as well, but then after a few months he said it's so difficult to do anything apart from academics. So if I go there he said he'll 100% come meet me but he can't say how many times and how often he could do that, which was kinda fine with me.

 And then he got the opportunity to come to my city. But things were different. It was a small 4 day trip. On the 1st day itself, we had a very deep conversation about his dad's health and how he wants to fulfill his wishes because he feels he has very less time with him and it sucks but it's time to end our romantic relationship. We always ALWAYS planned on remaining best friends since the beginning for the rest of our life and even now, I can confirm it's still the same. He's my best friend. Always there for me. My biggest support system. But it broke my heart so much because I really wanted the romantic phase to be a bit more longer. He said his family is looking for girls, and he might get married immediately after his MBA is over. And he needs time to process his feelings, get over me romantically, and accept me as ONLY friend. And he has been trying it since he joined his school. I wasn't. I was still fully in love and not ready to move on to what we call the next phase of our relationship, the friendship phase. 

And when he came to my city I hoped we would atleast make out maybe have sex and stuff, but it didn't happen. Not because I was scared because I actually wanted to do it. We shared a lot of intimate moments, but whenever I'd try to kiss him he'd say he isn't feeling it this time. And I kept pushing and pushing and he broke down, and said he loves me a lot but he just isn't able to kiss. He said he isn't as sexually attracted to me as earlier, infact lost a lot, and all the hugs and kisses on cheeks and everything mostly felt platonic but not sexual. He can kiss fine on my cheeks, my neck, give me small pecks on my lips, but not a proper kiss. He would hug me real tight, very close, but wasnt able to kiss. And it broke me. It really shattered me to pieces. I was numb. I couldn't process it. I was just hugging him throughout and he was a bit mad as well because he doesn't like creating a scene out in public so we went to a private area but he was just upset because he was really trying to keep me in his life as his best friend and I was just resisting it. 

We never wanted to do a dramatic breakup, we always planned on slowly transitioning to friendship, but I was just resisting it now when the time had come. His family is very serious about his marriage so he wants us to let go of the romantic part and get comfortable with friendship because it was affecting him as well. He hates seeing me upset, crying. I hate that I wasn't ready to understand what he was going through with his father's deteriorating health and the situation he was in. He turned down every girl that approached him in his school for me. He could've gotten into an another relationship made it easier for him to move on from me but he didn't wanna hurt me. I am just so blessed I found him. The constant pushing and then his breakdown gave me so much clarity. I was holding on to the idea of being one with him, I wanted to be his girlfriend so bad that I forgot to be his bestfriend. I wanted him to be my first so much that I kept pushing not realising he's trying very hard to move on from the romantic phase. I had some weird hope of celebrating our anniversary in a few months. I didn't realise we would break down real bad if we try to go back like we always were and then end it, it really will fuck with our minds. Specially his, since he's the one getting married soon. I am young so I still have time to get married and process my feelings. Not him. He can't afford to give us more time or else his mental health will just be severely affected. Which is why I realised it's time for us to end it, and only be friends for the rest of our lives. After I dropped him off at his hotel room he cried a lot. He told me that later. He cried non stop for an hour. I felt so much pain thinking he had to go through those things because of me.

The same night we planned a nightout, got drunk. It was my first time getting drunk and he always wanted to be the one who makes me try alcohol for the first time. We were very happy. We were hugging the whole time. And then I started crying, I guess because of the alcohol. I was so sad. He held me thoughout, he told me his feelings, how I am his no. 1 priority no matter what. Even if we are not in a romantic relationship he will always be with me as my best friend. And I promised him he will be mine. And I guess because he was drunk he couldn't resist it and we made out. He kissed me like he needed it. He just held me throughout. It felt really good. Then we went to a friend's house. Slept together. Didn't do anything. Just were holding each other tight and cuddling. We kissed, cuddled and I slept on his arms. He won't let me go even an inch apart. He was holding me really tight. I know we never had sex and ik we never will now. But this felt better. I felt so bad because he was resisting it so much while he was sober in his senses. He clung onto me like a baby. I was very emotional. But it felt good. This was yesterday. He left today. Went back to his school. We hugged me real tight. I promised I'll work on my feelings and try to let go. And we promised we'll meet again very soon. We'll always meet. Just, we promised each other the next time we meet we will officially be friends. 

I miss him. It's very difficult. He has given me the kind of love I feel no one can ever give me. I am his first true love and he is mine. I have been feeling down since he left. I wanted to hug him longer. I wanted to be with him for a longer time. It sucks that we have to do it like this. I hate that I didn't understand what he was going through. But I'm glad we met and clarified a lot of things. I know what stage we are in now. I hate that I made him cry. But ik he loves me even more. We will always support each other emotionally. I really want him to succeed in his life and make his father proud like he always wanted.  I hope he gets married to a good woman. I know I can't be the one but I hope we never lose the emotional connection, the love we have for each other. I don't want him to sacrifice his family or would be partner for me, no. And I'd never do that to another woman, make her insecure because of me. Because I'd have hated it if he had done that to me or if my future husband does that to me. But our love will always be the same for each other.

 I hope we meet again before he gets married. I want to spend time with him, have fun as his friend. I want to make up for the time we lost just crying and being upset when he was in my city. I don't want him to be sad. It's just difficult to move on now. It would've been 5 years in April next year. But its still going to be 5 years either ways. It's very difficult. Very very difficult. Felt like I had lost a part of me when he left. He told me we didn't lose any part, it just evolved. Ik he is right but I can't see things in a logical way now. So he said he'll be with me untill I'm ready. And I promised I won't bring up our romantic relationship at all. It's a slow and painful process. And I know I need him and he's right by my side. 


Its extremely painful for me now. Its very difficult to move on and let go, and accept these new changes. And I'm glad he could meet my another best friend and my sister who I'm really close to as well. We are part of the same friend circle now and we actually enjoy with each other all of us. I'm glad everyone is supporting me throughout this. But I don't know how to get out of this sadness I feel. I hope things get better.

If you read this till here, thank you. I know it will be difficult for a lot of you to understand these things since things are different here in S.E Asian households. We can't sacrifice our families. A lot of times it gets toxic, but it is what it is.",Ended a long term relationship and just want to share my feelings and let it out. warning: very long post

It's not even my inability to get into a relationship that's making me depressed, it's the fact that I'm below average for every country and for every gender. It makes me feel like a child and extremely emasculated and as a result I have zero self confidence which is making me despise my own body. I hate how people degrade me and talk about me using emasculating terms, sometimes I let the words get to me which makes me feel so hated. I shouldn't have to feel this way because I didn't choose this height or even this life and I know it's irrational to get depressed over something you can't even control and has little impact on my ability to perform basic tasks but I so desperately want to feel ""normal"".

2022-10-27 11:04:51,depression,"I started fluoxetine (prozac) in early to mid July this year. I dealt with the discomfort in my body for the beginning weeks and noticed improvements in my perception, thought process, beliefs, attitude, communication and personality. 

I could focus, I had energy when I got home from work to sit at my computer and complete admin tasks for my business and general life admin too. I had a desire to do the tasks I had at hand. I was proud of myself and felt good whilst doing these tasks. My decision making skills had improved, I was making choices with confidence and constantly had a feeling and belief that I could solve any problem that ensued and I could do it in a timely manner. I was future focused, I planned ahead and was proactive in my business and day to days. 

This goodness showed itself for 3-4 days in the first 3 weeks, whilst the discomfort became slightly unbearable. I then upped my dose to 40mg at the beginning of August. 

Shortly after the positive attitude and experiences had returned and hung around for a month. I was proactive. Energised. Positive. In control of my body and my mind, I was aligned. I wanted to develop my business, get more work, hire people. I was no longer afraid or timid. 

Compared to being depressed and EVERYTHING being so hard to start/do/focus on - I felt... NORMAL. In comparison, it was EASY to do anything I had thought I wanted to do. I counted my blessings every day and vocalised how being normal felt so good. 

I've returned to the depressed mood and mindset and having a couple tastes of normality really make the depressive times harder to deal with. Im avoiding the work I need to do, avoiding phone calls, avoiding invoicing, I've been gambling, eating heaps of sweets, sleeping in to 8-9 am (used to be up at 4-4:30 am and in the gym about 5).

I was always encouraged and told I could do anything growing up. I had a lot of potential and was a perfectionist. I had an incredibly happy childhood until I moved at 17. It wasn’t the move that did it, but I think that was just a convenient marker indicating when things changed.

For the past 14-15 years (I’m 32), I’ve struggled with major depression, generalized anxiety, anorexia, self harm, suicidal thoughts, you name it. I self sabotage like the best of them. I’ve told my parents it would be better for everyone if I was dead, but they disagree. I feel they have to say that, because it’s so obvious everyone around me would have a happier life with me gone. 

I hate every fiber of my being. I’ve tried and tried to be happy, but I just can’t try anymore. I’m so sad. Not over anything specifically, but generally. No interests or motivation. I go to work, pretend I’m happy and that my life is perfect, then start crying the minute I get in my car to leave. I

I have never done many things and I feel old. I want to live a good life but I feel like my life is already over. I ask myself often why not make it permanent and stop the jealousy, isolation and disappointment of life.

Funny thing is, I've been like this for years. Taking my dad's anti-depressants because I'm almost scare of what they might say. I have scars from self-harm at the top of my forearm as I got caught (when I started) with some near the hand - My mum, a person who works with depressed people, had a double take at them and never said a word.

Maybe I don’t deserve to be as much as some other people but did I really deserve my depression getting this much worse? I don’t have school or work anymore and I still feel like I need a break. I don’t understand at all.",I’ve been hit with a huge wave of sadness for the last two weeks
2022-10-26 15:58:36,depression,"I'm out of options. I've reached what feels like a guarantee that nothing will change for the better from here on out.

Now if I went to a therapist, I can only assume what they would do in my situation. They'll try working me around it. Getting me to just live with it, to cope with it. They can't undo the art pains I have.

About two and a half years now, this same thing has haunted me. And as much as I love talking about it, I'll admit it for once that this is merely the straw that broke the camel's back. I already tried shooting myself in 2016. And I failed.

It's the single biggest regret of my entire life. I could've been nonexistent by now. I wouldn't have had to experience an ounce of the envy. I wouldn't have had to find a version of myself who didn't fail in every aspect. I wouldn't have had to witness my ideas and desires already executed and perfected. I wouldn't have had to end up slamming my head into walls out of the frustration, the anguish, and the emptiness it all brought onto me from then on.

I have no passion, and I can't force it either. So I can't enjoy the process. So I won't just do it, and I won't go anywhere.

It's like the universe is looking me dead in the eyes, and asking. ""Why haven't you necked yourself yet?""

Because I'm scared. It's because I'm scared. No amount of being pissed off and resentful of the universe for existing will make me feel even slightly comfortable or entitled to something that isn't just more bullshit waiting patiently on the other side.

Even if I somehow pushed through this passion barrier of mine, it'd be years of work before any of it looked tolerable. My ideas can't even be considered my own anymore. And awful free-time lacking adult life is kicking in, in a world that already provoked a suicide attempt out of me before any of this art crap, way back when I was just 14.

I'll say it yet again. Everything I should've been is already out there. And I'm not exactly puncturing a hole in the art spectrum with my death, or just lack of contribution.

I'll never write anything worth reading. I'll never compose anything worth listening. I'll never draw anything worth witnessing. I'll never do anything worth acknowledging.

And sure, I'll *never* do these things if I'm dead. And if I'm gonna die anyways, why not try? So I tried.

I tried once, it felt awful. Soul-draining, tiring. I ended up going nowhere, and haven't touched drawing for 8 months now.

Then I tried again, something else. Doesn't work, my circumstances forbid it. Probably wouldn't have gone anywhere anyways.

And then I tried again, something else.

""dime-a-dozen""

""boring""

And I couldn't agree more. That's just what happens when I try to do anything. Not like it would've gone anywhere in the end, it depended on me being capable of art, but I'm just a complete failure.

Everything sucks. I hate it all. Nothing interests me anymore.

My only dreams are perpetual infeasibilities.

The days of having free time and getting enough sleep to make waking up worth it are long gone.

I wish my dad loved my mom.

I don't want to die. I don't want to do anything anymore.

I just wish I never existed.

The only positive thing I have to say, is that all this thinking about limbo as a concept and comparing it to my life, reminds me of the game LIMBO. That was a cool game.",Art limbo has hollowed me
2022-10-26 15:55:04,depression,"Okay so update, since Diwali is going on, my cousin came over to our house since she couldn’t go to her hometown because of college. She’s my paternal uncle’s older daughter. My father seemed pretty excited since she was coming over. We woke up in the morning and went to her college to pick her up. There my father took us for breakfast in a canteen in the campus. We ate and then he said we’re going shopping at the mall. I was quite surprised cuz whenever I asked him for anything he said he didn’t have any money. I knew he was lying because he would go out with his friends every weekend and have drinks, dinner ,etc. After coming home he would taunt my mother and try to fight with her cuz he was drunk. I was kinda happy that at least he was taking us to the mall but it wasn’t too late when I realised that he’s just doing it because my cousin is here and not for me. We went shopping  and bought clothes. Soon after while billing, I was kinda annoyed that he didn’t even make us keep away any clothes and payed the 14k bill without any hesitation. I wasn’t jealous or something but what made me angry was that he refused to buy me materials for one of my big projects from school which was supposed to be completed in vacation, saying that he didn’t have any money and that he’s not the only parent and that I’m not only HIS responsibility. I was shattered. I mean if you didn’t want to take your kids responsibility, why did you make the decision to have us? It’s not like we got an application that we want you to be our parent, it would’ve been better if you just didn’t make the decision to give a life to me , at least I wouldn’t suffer. I then just decided to ignore those thoughts at that moment cuz I didn’t wanna be cranky or mean in front of my cousin so I just left it there. Then we went to have lunch. Fast forward to the evening when we came back home from the mall. We all got ready, did the rituals and went to my new house. There we showed my cousin around and clicked pictures. Before leaving , my mother asked everyone for food and snacks except me. My cousin noticed that and felt really bad for what was happening so she shared her snacks with me. There were also some pictures of my mother which were clicked in my phone and then only words my mother kept on saying to me were “ go and send me my pictures, immediately “. Like they were some sort of oxygen to her life. I was devastated. The whole time she just kept on saying that. My cousin noticed that too. She told me that she knows what was going on and that she knows how much they’ve hit me and ignored me since I was a kid. When I told her they still do that, she was surprised and when I asked her if her parents ever hit her, she said nope. Her family is really nice and they have a lot of fun. Everyone is treated equally and all of them enjoy every moment of their life. When I was at their place, they used to play family games, joke around, go out and everything like every normal family does. Tbh when I was a kid , I thought that all families are like ours and all of this is normal, until I started going to my friends’ houses to hangout and stuff. Later that night we talked till 3:00 am in the morning. Then the next day we had breakfast and went down to play with some cats. Later that afternoon my father went to drop her back. I didn’t go along since my legs were aching and there was an eclipse lined up in our country so it could’ve been dangerous. ( people say that there are radiations and stuff ) when he came back, we asked him if we could go out for dinner. He kept on saying that I ask your mother and why should I take y’all. Then when we called her up and asked her she said no. Then he said I’ll take you. Later at night he refused again. He claims that he never lies and always keeps his promises but he’s the biggest liar. Even greater than my mother. Sometimes I just feel like they were meant to get married cuz such people end up together and it’s better than getting married to someone innocent and tying their life. But when such people decide to have children, it’s a complete disaster. And by such upbringing and stress, even me and my brother might end up like them. I really don’t want that too happen. I would never even dream of ruining someone else’s life just like they ruined mine. My maid isn’t going to come today and so there won’t be any food in the evening. My father went out and he’ll prolly come back at midnight like always. My mother will also go out and will come back late. Then it’ll be only me and my brother and we’ll be left with no option other than going to bed hungry, like always. My mother will probably take him out as well. I’ll be alone, like I have always been….",My life is so unfair pt.2

I am twenty, nearly twenty-one year old failure who has hit the point of no return. I lost my house last month which led to me selling most of my belongings. I have friends but they don't seem at all concerned for my mental health. None of them worry about me, or stress, or tell me to get help. The only time they seem to sweat over me is when I lash out and become an active detriment to their wellbeing. I have a partner but I know I'm just a liability to them. I have no job, no license, and I'm failing college. My dad has cancer and will probably be dead in the next decade.

2022-10-26 14:18:27,depression,"For obvious reasons, this is a burn account (I think). As I am currently writing this, I feel fine. However, that might change the further along I write this. I just want to vent a little about the many things I have felt and will feel. 

Over these past few years, I have come to realize that I am by no means significant in the slightest. I cannot be admired as a good person, and I cannot even be recognized as a bad person. I am just a nobody. A nobody that is slightly more incompetent than everybody else at everything. I am not athletic, nor am I intelligent. I have no talent for anything, and I do not have any achievements that I can be proud of. I would say that I have more empathy than an average person, but I would be lying. I probably have the same, if not, much less than the average amount. I want to be a good person, but I fail so miserably at it. And I do not want to be a bad person either, but I probably leave that impression people. If you were to compare me to any of my friends or family, you would realize almost immediately, that I am essentially the failure of the bunch, the defect. My friends are reaching far for their goals, whether its sports or what they are studying, and my siblings are in some ways iconic. They are making a change for themselves, and maybe even the community around them. I am nothing like them. I'm lazy, depressed, boring, intimidating, weak, every single bad thing you can think of. I'm not useless. I'm worse than useless, and it hurts knowing that there's nothing I can do.  

I have many regrets in life. Maybe much more than the average person. At almost every moment I'm alone with my thoughts, I am reminded of something I did. It wasn't always bad, and sometimes it was a misunderstanding that I realized, but it still hurts every time I am reminded of something I did. Even now, I keep making mistakes that I deeply regret (nothing serious). There are many times where I thought, what if I was never born? What if I disappeared forever, if I was forgotten? I think about all of those moments I acted bratty as a child, made my parents a little more stressed. I think about all of the money they could have had if I didn't exist. They care about me, of course, but I wouldn't have been as forgiving as them. I just wonder why I made so many mistakes, why I couldn't be more competent. I am sure if I never existed, everyone would have lived a much better life. I'm just a waste of space and money. 

I wanted to develop more as a person, so I could finally be someone that deserves to live, but I am nowhere near that point. I am currently bombarded with schoolwork, and I haven't found time to do stuff for myself. The worst part is that half of this problem is my fault due to poor time management. Of course, I have an idea of what I want to do, but I just don't have any reason to fight for it. Friends? Don't have any close ones nowadays. Family? They're probably fine. A special someone? I wish. Over these past few years, I have been conflicted. I want to make friends, go to parties, have fun. But am I even interesting enough? How could I possibly do something like that? I want to become someone special, someone people could look up to, but I am clearly terrible at everything I do. It's been like that ever since I was born. I want to be in a loving relationship with a beautiful and caring girl. I want to be able to dance with her on the beach. I want to be able to bask under the sun as we lay our heads against each. I want to be able to raise kids, watch them grow up to be someone great and happy unlike me. But I know very clearly that someone like me will never deserve such a luxury. The day that happens is the day Jesus returns to Earth for his second coming.

In short I was really sick from a lot of things and I became depressed, I'm not sure if it was a side effect from the medication or just my situation but I just didn't feel happy no matter what. Its not like I didn't try, I exercised and ate healthy and did my work. I tried to pull my life together and put myself back together because I remember I used to be so happy.

And whenever I talk to people it feels like my body reverts to my old personality so no one knows. I just want to cry but I can't. Recently I was with someone who made me feel a bit of happiness through physical affection, but now that I've felt that I can't stop thinking about how I want to see this person. But I shouldn't since I know I'd be using them for my own emotional gain. It sucks because I know someone can love me but I can't love them back, so I should just cut them out as to not hurt them.

I am in constant pain. It makes life hard to even enjoy. I’ve missed out on birthdays and events because of it. I just go to work and come home. I have no future because I don’t want to have one if this pain continues. I am also afraid I won’t have a future because after six months the doctors have not helped me. So my mind goes the worst case scenario. Last night I woke up crying so hard that I was having a full on meltdown. I was sobbing uncontrollably. I felt like my heart had been broken in half. I’ve been a mess ever since and can’t stop crying. I can’t hold it together anymore. I’m physically and emotionally exhausted and work absolutely drains me.

Rather than being angry with them it made me realize how much better my GF is at doing or being all of the things that I should be. 

I noticed how she was able to spark happiness in my family and that they were genuinely happy to see her and cared for her well-being. I noticed how her friendship with all my friends was stronger and more intimate than my own relationship with them. She even recently switched careers to something related to my job and got a much better position than I did without having to prepare for months as I did to get my mediocre job. 

In summary, I realized how much better she was at being me than myself. This thought has been particularly harmful for two main reasons: first, in many times I have found support and relief in my relationship with her, but now I can only think of her with a bitter ressentment that grows over time, I literally lost one of the only things that I was able to cherish from my life. Second, it has amplified my self-destructive tendencies as the logical conclusion is that everyone and everything would be better without me and that my mere existence is if not inconvenient actively harmful to everyone around me.

2022-10-26 12:12:52,depression,"Hi everyone,

I had a rough time this year because I realized I didn't want to continue the career I have been working on for almost eight years at this point (1 year on one graduation closely related that I left, 5 concluding a graduation and 2 years on masters). I'm 26 yo, almost 27. I won't state which career is that because I don't want to demotivate any possible aspirants, which has happened before. I lost my wish to work with it because the routine is really overwhelming, the payment is not fair (terrible for the most part), and there are a lot of limitations regarding living conditions, dignity and personal security.

I took some vocational tests, did a lot of research, and realized my best option would be to follow the career as an artist working with digital art, animation, modeling, etc. The issue is that I'm still really an amateur at it, and since my childhood I have been self-sabotating myself about this possibility, always giving up thinking I'm bad. I consider I have significant creativity and a keen eye due to my previous jobs that required a lot of observation and visual description, but not that much practice on drawing or painting itself. I'm trying every week, did some drawing which people around complimented a lot, but still... I'm nowhere near a professional, some which are way younger. I get bummed out imagining how much I have to work to establish a new path, and I lose motivation, leading to depression and anxiety.

I'm currently unemployed after 6 years in a row having some money on my own due to doing academic funding. I had some really heavy stuff happening at my personal life, so, trying to cope, I spent my savings after some months... which were not that much, tbh. I have tried applying to some companies around here, but didn't get a single job, making me feel like I'm worthless. My parents are helping me out. They have a good amount of money, and told me they will pay a 2 year graduation on graphic design until I can stabilize financially again... but that puts a lot of shame on me because I'm way too old to rely on my parents paying for my living. It just hits really hard on my selfsteem. I'm not sure I should just accept it and focus on my studies or starting working at any shitty job that will hurdle me until I can get a internship just for personal fulfillment.

The combination of not yet being good at what I want to do for a living, losing faith on the career I previously dreamed with, and not having any money on my own anymore at this stage of my life puts me in this position were I get stuck self-sabotaging telling myself everyday I will fail at life, and I shouldn't ever try working on anything because I will fail. I really don't know how to focus again and improve myself in a stable manner, so I'm frequently distracting myself from all this anxiety with quick, addictive relieves.",How to stop self-sabotating professionally?

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to be happy again

&amp;#x200B;

All I ask is for a normal day

&amp;#x200B;

All I want is a beautiful sunrise

&amp;#x200B;

All I want is to yawn

&amp;#x200B;

But in moments like this I think of younger days

&amp;#x200B;

So high my problems go away

And I think back to when I was truly happy

It takes so much to get here, to the peace

&amp;#x200B;

It takes so much but it's worth it for the moment, to be myself again

Because when I'm stoned, that's the only time the real me comes out, and I've been fighting so hard to come back to my body but the ravenous being that's killing me has taken over, and I can't escape, and I want to break free

&amp;#x200B;

I usually think about drugs, and dying, and things like that

&amp;#x200B;

And I usually fight with my family and resent my friends

&amp;#x200B;

But now I think back to saying I love you to my family, and to having fun with my friends, and remembering when I could feel raw emotion

&amp;#x200B;

I've been getting closer to the edge, my sanity is paper thin, who knows if I'll be alive in a few months or a few years, cause all I do sober is think about suicide and more potent drugs. I get closer every day. Maybe I'll make an attempt at either one day. 

&amp;#x200B;

Cause my brain is fixed right now, when I'm so high, but, when I'm not, when I'm being ravaged by the demon that controls my mind and body, all I lean towards is self destruct and never growth

&amp;#x200B;

And it's sad that this is the only time I get to be freee. I'm here. I'm telling you this is the real me, I'm here, and I never get to speak, I'm actually talking. Depression is a horrible disease. It's like a waking coma where somebody else who isn't you takes over your body, and everyone sees you at your worst, and some people only know you for your worst. It's so devastating.

&amp;#x200B;

 But I'm so happy to be here and to share moments like this with you all. Though the mind of my demon is corrupt and filled with hate anger and despair, I know the real me, and I am filled with light to shine, and love to spread

&amp;#x200B;

And though the demon inside me tries to tell me I have an ugly body and a rotten soul, I know the truth, that I am beautiful on the outside and magnificent on the inside, and the same is true for you. I love you all. I hope this isn't the last time the real me speaks to you. I hope the real me doesn't die. Also, for what it's worth, when everybody leaves me, it is helpful to know that God loves me, and I have one more reason to live and one more shoulder to lean on. Thank you for lending me your ear.

The doctor-therapist relationship was non-existent and my doctor never got this information. I told Marcy that I was still cutting but was upset because I still couldn't feel anything. She told me that feeling nothing was still better then being depressed. I told my mom how miserable I felt around Amy and Marcy, begged her to help me change doctors. She always had more important things to get done then deal with me and my doctor drama.   


I was forced to keep up this relationship for two years cause my mom told me the medication would stop if I ""switched"" doctors. I later found out this was something she made up and mom acted like this wasn't a big deal. She couldn't understand why I was so upset with her and still doesn't. It felt like she was always guilt-tripping me into seeing Marcy even though I had nothing good to say about her. These therapy sessions made me very upset and I would stay in bed all day after the session. 

Then I started getting heavily paranoid in my own home, I've never had a history of paranoia. I started getting vivid images in my head and hearing noises around the house. I spent two hours in a bathroom cause I felt like someone was outside the door. I told Amy and she just said lithium has no side effects like that. I told Marcy and I don't think she believed me at all. I was desperate and no one took me seriously. Mom just told me to stop watching horror movies and that was the end of that. My brother was concerned after watching how I acted in the house and the pills I listed off but no one listened to him either. 

I started refusing my lithium pills and went completely cold turkey. No one could get me to take the medicine and they started blaming me for making things difficult. I just kept telling them that I had enough and I was scared. That was two weeks of pure hell, my tics came back and I still have fingernail scars on my arms. They figured I would break eventually and basically said all this was my fault. I told them I don't want to see Marcy anymore and they finally gave me a new therapist. She was actually terrible too and now I'm taking online therapy and doing much better. I hated that hospital and everyone in that building. I went from being a heavy cutter at 18 years old to being heavily suicidal and harmful after all this happened.   


My relationship with my mom is strained because she still feels like she did nothing wrong. As if she didn't spend years handing me off to doctors and forcing me to take so much medication that I couldn't even remember the labels anymore. I remember telling Marcy that I don't bother remembering the names because they change so often. I want to open up to my new therapist about these events but wouldn't even know where to start. 

This used to feel so normal and now I'm having fits of anger and having crying episodes. I keep recalling things and that sends me into crying episodes and I don't know why. My family refuse to acknowledge the problem and I learned how to fake it in order to not cause more tension. I still feel on the edge though, like I'm always ready to scream or break down.

This really changed my opinion of my own family and I'm eager to move out once the opportunity comes along. I just don't want them in my life right now honestly.",My ex-therapist made me suicidal (rant)
2022-10-26 11:24:03,depression,"I'm out of options. I've reached what feels like a guarantee that nothing will change for the better from here on out, and I've been ""living"" like a robot. A little bit longer of this, and I may end up numb enough to actually exit finally.

If I went to a therapist, what will they do in my situation? They'll try working me around it. Getting me to just live with it, to cope with it. They can't undo the art pains I have.

About two and a half years now, this same thing has haunted me. And as much as I love talking about it, I'll admit it for once that this is merely the straw that broke the camel's back. I already tried shooting myself in 2016. And I failed.

It's the single biggest regret of my entire life. I could've been nonexistent by now. I wouldn't have had to experience an ounce of the envy. I wouldn't have had to find a version of myself who didn't fail in every aspect. I wouldn't have had to witness my ideas and desires already executed and perfected. I wouldn't have had to end up slamming my head into walls out of the frustration, the anguish, and the emptiness it all brought onto me from then on.

I have no passion, and I can't force it either. So I can't enjoy the process. So I won't just do it, and I won't go anywhere.

It's like the universe is looking me dead in the eyes, and asking. ""Why haven't you necked yourself yet?""

Because I'm scared. It's because I'm scared. No amount of being pissed off and resentful of the universe for existing will make me feel even slightly comfortable or entitled to something that isn't just more bullshit waiting patiently on the other side.

Even if I somehow pushed through this passion barrier of mine, it'd be years of work before any of it looked tolerable. My ideas can't even be considered my own anymore. And awful free-time lacking adult life is kicking in, in a world that already provoked a suicide attempt out of me before any of this art crap, way back when I was just 14.

I'll say it yet again. Everything I should've been is already out there. And I'm not exactly puncturing a hole in the art spectrum with my death, or just lack of contribution.

I'll never write anything worth reading. I'll never compose anything worth listening. I'll never draw anything worth witnessing. I'll never do anything worth acknowledging.

And sure, I'll never do these things if I'm dead. And if I'm gonna die anyways, why not try? So I tried.

I tried once, it felt awful. Soul-draining, tiring. I ended up going nowhere, and haven't touched drawing for 8 months now.

Then I tried again, something else. Doesn't work, my circumstances forbid it. Probably wouldn't have gone anywhere anyways.

And then I tried again, something else.

""dime-a-dozen""

""boring""

And I couldn't agree more. That's just what happens when I try to do anything. Not like it would've gone anywhere in the end, it depended on me being capable of art, but I'm just a complete failure.

Having no creativity in any aspect fucking sucks after a while. Well, not like I'd be able to even utilize creativity if I had any.

Everything sucks. I hate it all. Nothing interests me anymore.

My only dreams are perpetual infeasibilities, I wish I could've been capable of the arts I wanted.

The days of having free time and getting enough sleep to make waking up worth it are long gone.

I wish my dad loved my mom.

I don't want to die. I don't want to do anything anymore.

I just wish I never existed.

The only positive thing I have to say, is that all this thinking about limbo as a concept and comparing it to my life, reminds me of the game LIMBO. That was a cool game.",Incapability of art has pushed me over.

2022-10-26 11:09:17,depression,"At age 25 (male) I can’t find anything I remotely enjoy.

Quick backstory: I went to a mental hospital earlier this year in June and haven’t been the same since. I was on Zoloft for 2 years and thought it was safe to go cold-turkey off it. We’ll it resulted in a manic/psychosis episode. I was feeling great before, but found out getting off medication too quickly can relapse depression. I thought I would get over this quickly after getting back on the same medication, but it didn’t work anymore. So I’m trying another hoping it will work.  

Anyways, I currently have such a negative view on life. I used to enjoy video games, don’t anymore. I used to go out occasionally with people to be social, don’t even care anymore. I’m alone, and tell myself I don’t need anyone. I’ve been told I’m attractive my whole life, but find myself looking in the mirror thinking the opposite. Im still trying to figure out what to do for a living, then find one the thing that seems difficult about it and give up looking (Also ADHD.) Now I just sit here in bed hoping one day I’ll feel happy again. My biggest fear is that I stay working the same job that I can’t stand the rest of my life. 

Normal people find enjoyment in lots of things. It seems like I can find the negative to anything now and I’m just stuck in an empty void. I usually just don’t talk anymore because conversation to me is just to take up time. I hope this medication works. I hate the fact I have to take a pill to be happy, but it’s all I have. I hope it works. Thanks for reading, I hope no one has to ever feel this pain in their life.",I don’t enjoy anything

2022-10-26 11:03:05,depression,"Hey, so I started a new job in May that involved moving across the country. My wife and our toddler moved with me and we’ve been here for 6 months. Lately, the wife doesn’t want anything to do with me. She berates me from the time she gets up until the time I go and sleep in a separate room. So my self esteem is pretty low, but now our toddler has also started only wanting her mom. So now no one in my house is happy with me. On top of this, I’ve been increasingly feeling more and more alone when I’m at work. I am around over 50 people from 8am to 4pm, I talk with them, eat breakfast and lunch with them but I don’t feel any connection with them. It’s the craziest thing to be in a workspace with 50 people and still feel completely alone. 

I don’t have any one to talk to, hang out with or anything like that. I’m usually outgoing and happy but everything is just kind of twisting and it’s different. 

I don’t enjoy doing anything any more. It feels like I have no friends, and then when I come home I’m ignored again. 

I don’t know if I’m explaining any of this well enough to get across the way I’m feeling but I just don’t care about really anything anymore. My wife can tell at me and tell me I’m useless but I just sit there silent. My daughter runs past me to go to her mom even though she sees me first and I just keep doing whatever i was doing. I see all my coworkers in groups laughing and talking but yet I feel alone because I don’t fit in to any of these groups.

Especially things like my voice, my face and I mean I’m genuinely ashamed of my name because it’s an Arabic name and not some generic English name like all my friends have. I hate my life. I’m only 17 and I’m contemplating suicide. I’m fresh out of high school and while everyone’s already off doing what they want I’m stuck behind not knowing what to do. I don’t have many friends and the people I do try to talk to make friends with I just can’t because of my anxiety. I was bullied for every year of high school and while the first year I dealt with it myself I just don’t have the confidence anymore (high school is over and I’m still being bullied).

I have acne (not too bad anymore but it’s still there), I used to have dandruff and while it’s not there anymore I still get bullied for it, I’m overweight (apparently not very noticeable but it makes me feel like shit). And as for my future I don’t know where I’m taking myself and it scares me so badly. I’ve always known what I’ve wanted from my life in the wife and kids sense but not knowing what I want to do for a career (or can do because of my anxiety and grades out of high school) is terrifying me and that with the fear I may never meet anyone who loves me is just pushing me further to the way out.

2022-10-26 10:44:58,depression,"my therapist thinks it will be a good idea to look into past events in my life and process memories. some emdr kind of stuff. we came across a traumatic one. i was sexually assaulted at the age of 6 by someone my age and he thinks it increased my social issues i had growing up. although i always had it since before. the event itself of me being taken advantage of by someone i considered a friend doesn’t bother me that much. but the things that happened because of it do. i did something really bad to someone when i was young and i believe it wouldn’t have happened if i was never assaulted. i’m still close to the person i hurt and i feel immense guilt. if an adult did what i did, they’d be in jail and there’d be no excuse. but i was a child. either way he thinks this is vital and i need to process it but no matter how i think about it, it doesn’t seem that important to my main concern which is my anxiety and depression. to me it was always buried. if i don’t think about it i will be fine. i’ll always feel guilty but i know it is something that will never come up. (it’s something only i know) there will be immense consequences and pain if i bring it to light. 

he insists we look into it but it doesn’t play into my main insecurities because ive already assured myself that i was a kid. but he’s so interested in it and no matter how i put it, it’s like he’s saying it’s the only way to go forward in therapy but the thing is i don’t want to. some things are better left unsaid. this memory might bite me back in the ass later as an adult. right now though i want to focus on finding myself, bettering my depression, and social skills as i am entering adulthood soon. it’s my priority. i’m scared if i don’t follow what he says he’ll drop be because he really made it seem like if i don’t do this there’s nothing he can do for me. how do i deal with this? he’s my fourth therapist. things were going great until now and now i feel like no one understands me. i’m lonely.

For the past few years my life has been on repeat. I can’t stop smoking weed, staying up late at night, and ignoring my responsibilities (working out, studying, responding to emails etc.) everyday I tell myself that tomorrow is the day I change; I’m gonna wake up early, study, go to the gym, and not smoke.

2022-10-26 10:02:16,depression,"My life is a mess. I barely even know where to start. I’m in one of my worst depressive episodes and I don’t know what to do. 

Well, my mother cut contact with me “as a birthday present to herself” and she hasn’t contacted me in weeks. Because I dared to have covid on her birthday. My dad guilts me every time I don’t have my son and I feel like a failure of a mother. 

I’m all but kicked out of uni and I’ve been given loads of deadlines by Christmas or I’m out. This is because of lack of engagement with the course which is because my psychiatrist got my driving licence taken away (while discharging me with no meds and a bipolar diagnosis by the way, fuck you NHS mental health) and balancing seeing my son everyday running on no energy. Again, failure. 

And then there’s my partner. He’s VERY hot and cold. Some days he’ll be sweet and affectionate, some days he will ignore me. For example, today I couldn’t get out of bed. He offered to buy me lunch but I denied as I have no appetite. He came back and I was in bed, numb and crying. He stayed downstairs, watching YouTube and having his lunch. Obviously he needed his lunch but at times I just feel like a burden. At the beginning of the relationship, he was amazing. My previous partner (and my sons dad) passed away 2 and a half years ago. On the anniversary of his death, he took me out to distract me even though it was his mums birthday. But now, if I talk about anything that upsets me (not my previous boyfriend I don’t mention him), he gets defensive and argues with me. Every time. I’m currently sat in bed upset and we got in an argument and he’s gone downstairs to watch tv “because if we talk, we’ll argue and he can’t be arsed with it”. Obviously I’m not perfect either but I just want to be able to talk. 

I’m just fucking worthless. I have no one. I can’t talk to anyone or get any help because it will delay my driving licence further which is a big problem as without it I can barely leave the house. I don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t see myself having a future.
